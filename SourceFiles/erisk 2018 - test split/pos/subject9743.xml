<TITLE> Anybody know where to find vintage "Frodo Lives" buttons? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First of all - sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this inquiry, if that's the case please point me in the right direction!

Long story short, my father is both a hippie and a Tolkien fan. As I'm sure many of you know, the hippie movement in the 60's and 70's used the phrase "Frodo Lives!" a lot, whether is was on shirts on buttons or even graffiti. When I asked my father what he wants for the holidays, he told me all he wants is a pin with that phrase from that time period. I have been able to find recreations on ebay and etsy, but I am having a hard time finding one specifically from the 60's and 70's. Would anybody be able to point me in the right direction? Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Alpha Sapphire won't accept 1.2 Update?? Help! </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I got a preowned copy of Alpha Sapphire today and I was trying to get on GTS. It told me I needed an update, so I clicked the link and went to the eshop. I downloaded the update and went back to the game, it told me "data necessary for the internet connection has not been obtained." Ok, so I deleted the download and redownloaded. Checked again, but still "data necessary for the internet connection has not been obtained." I thought maybe I had to restart the system in order for the update to work, but the error message happened again. I even tried it on my old 3ds, still says "data necessary for the internet connection has not been obtained." I have no idea what is wrong, I can connect just fine to the internet on other games, I even managed to get a mystery gift from AS but I just can't get to anything else. Help please?? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, be warned that there will be a wall of text. 

Background: I am the 21 year old middle child of my parents, I have an older sister who is 23 and a younger brother who is 18. In 2012, I came downstairs and saw my mother on her laptop - I could see the picture she was looking at, it was a picture of her lying in bed with some guy. I asked who he was, and without any hesitation, she turned to me and said, "Your father and I are getting a divorce." Immediately I started screaming and crying, I thought everything had been going so well. My older sister just came home from study abroad 2 days before, I thought we were all going to be a family again. I fell to the flood and backed myself into a corner, my sister heard me and ran to me. I managed to get out that they were getting a divorce, and she began to cry, too. My brother was the last to come into the room, he's on the autism spectrum and is very bad at showing his emotions. He asked what was going on, so my mother turned and told him, "Mommy and Daddy are getting a divorce. Daddy is going to move in with his parents." Somehow, the situation settled enough for everybody to speak in a (somewhat) calm manner. I asked why, she said it was because my dad "couldn't satisfy her" in bed, and she had been seeing another man for the part 4 years. My sister and I had known she had cheated on our father before for the same reasons, and she told us that it was the same man almost 10 years later. Of course I didn't want to hear anything about their bedroom lives, I began to ask why she got to stay and dad had to leave. She said her plan was to keep us all here until my brother (then 16) graduated high school, then she was going to sell the house. She said that was enough time for my sister and I to get off the ground and out of the house, and my brother could live in the dorms when he goes to college. I had no idea how my father was okay with this, all he would say is that he loved my mother and just wanted to be happy. Over the next few days, I learned many things about my parents that I wish I hadn't. Every child has that realization that their parents aren't the people they thought they were, but this was shoved down our throats. In the next few weeks my parents did everything wrong. They came home drunk and while my father was trying to go to sleep my mother professed her love to the man she was seeing and told my brother and I who her favorites were. My brother got it all on video. A couple days later my mom and that man broke up because my dad went to his house and yelled at him. To cut this background short, I'll just skip to the end. My siblings and I told my mother that we didn't want to live with her, and she should leave. We convinced our father that it was not entirely his fault, and we have been living happily with him for the past 2 years. He doesn't talk to or about her. The only way he'll acknowledge her existence is when we call her "ED." (That means Egg Donor.) We tried to maintain a relationship with her, but she slowly left our lives and that brings us to where we are now.

Last week, my sister and I were talking about how our mother had blocked us and all our friends on facebook. We found that a little suspect, so we looked at her twitter. On there we found out why she wasn't speaking to us or visiting. She is seeing somebody. My sister and I confronted her about it via text, and she told us that she hid it because she knew we would react this way. I wouldn't have had a problem with her seeing somebody new, it's been 2 years. I had a problem with her hiding everything. Today, I found out that who she was seeing was the same guy. The guy she slept with when I was a child, the guy she was seeing while my sister was starving herself, the guy she was kissing when I was hospitalized for multiple suicide attempts, the guy she left my father for. Now, I've tried to be civil with her. Before she left home she would come into my room and cry to me for hours. I didn't want to hear it because I was in a lot of pain as well, but she was my mommy and I didn't want to see her hurting. That's my downfall, I can't separate the person I thought she was with the person she actually is. I have put myself in situations I know I shouldn't have been in because of this flaw. During tax season I was the go between for them, it was terrible. I got yelled at by both sides. I stood up to them and told them I wasn't a walkie talkie, but they still use me as such. After finding out the news today, it finally broke the illusion that I was unable to see through. I can now identify how terrible she was in the past, how she used my sisters anorexia and my BPD to get in with the people at her work (she works in health care.) I could see how she would take everything my siblings or I had and brag about it on facebook for people to 'like' and praise her on. I could see how, in March at my childhood friend's funeral, she cried more than I did because she wanted the attention. I know now, I do not want her in my life. One of the main reasons I was communicating with her still was because she pays for my therapy, but at this point I don't care if I lose my car or my therapist or anything else - I need her gone. I feel extremely sad, I feel like I lost somebody but it's surreal because the person I'm losing never existed. I don't know what I'm expecting from this, I guess I would like to hear from you all as well as get it all off my chest. Thanks you, guys.

(sorry, no tl;dr because I honestly cannot shorten it.) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Mouthguard causing sensitivity? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-03 14:54:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm a 21 year old female and I've been grinding my teeth for a while. After having some bits chip off through the night, I decided to invest in a mouthguard. They took a cast of my teeth and made it out of a resin-like material. (I don't know/remember the exact material.) For the first few nights it worked really well, I woke up feeling a lot less strained. However, I can't use it anymore. 

About a week after using it nightly, I began to notice some sensitivity. At first I was worried that it was a cavity, but based on the placement and timing I found that to be odd. The only sensitivity I am having is on the outer side of the back upper molar on each side of my mouth, right in the area where the mouthguard would sit. I've never had tooth sensitivity before, so I figured I could invest in some Sensodyne and that would allow me to continue to use the mouthguard. Win-win, right?

Wrong. Not only did the Sensodyne taste awful, but it barely worked. I had to stop wearing the mouthguard in order to alleviate some of the sensitivity. I wasn't able to eat/drink anything cold, hot, or sweet. I am now going to bed without the mouthguard and continuing to use the Sensodyne, but there is still some sensitivity on the outer side of those molars. As of right now, I do not have dental insurance so the mouthguard was pretty costly, and I'm not even able to get any use out of it. 

Is this a common problem? When they were casting my teeth they did have some trouble, they couldn't find the right size to cast it with so they had to fill my mouth with that foam 5 or 6 times, so I'm wondering if that messed up the sizing? Is there any way to fix the mouthguard so it would work without causing me pain? Also, is there a way to get rid of that sensitivity? 

TL;DR: mouthguard made molars sensitive, have to choose between sensitivity or grinding. 

Sorry if this was a long read, thank you in advance if you have any info/advice! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am looking for cemeteries where the owners/caretakers/families have left and the area has been taken back by nature. I read in an article that in our state was have an estimated 400+ of these sites, so I'm hoping that somebody here can point me in the right direction. I am starting a new photo manipulation/surrealist photography project and I would love to set some photos in these areas.

I live in central CT, so I can basically travel just about anywhere in the state and I'm willing to do so. If anybody knows about some lost grave sites, please let me know! Thanks :D

<TEXT> First of all, that's way too much of a deficit for her. Unless she's looking to lose muscle mass rather than fat. Assuming the height and weight you gave us are accurate, she should be eating around 1600 calories and working out in order to lose weight at a healthy rate.

If she is eating 1600 calories rather than the claimed 800, 10lbs in 2 months sounds about right. Her TDEE is 2200 and her BRM is 1600. At a deficit of 600, it would take her 6(ish) days to lose a pound. If both months were 31 day months that would be 62 days. Divide 62 days by 6 and you get a little bit over 10.

So, it seems she was either lying about how many calories she was actually eating or she was eating her exact BMR for two months. </TEXT>

But of course, this is coming from some rando on the internet so I'd advise a trip to the dermatologist.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Basically this, but a few edits. 

Shirley Turner and Andrew Bagby were never married. They had a very rocky relationship and he had recently broken up with her. 

Turner drove from Iowa to Pennsylvania to meet with Bagby, murdered him in a park, and drove all the way back to Iowa in one night.

When Turner learned she was being looked at by police, she fled to her home in Canada. The Canadian justice system was slow moving to extradite her. 

While extradition was pending, Turner gave birth to Zachary - a child she revealed to be Bagby's. Bagby's parents up and moved to Canada to try for custody of Zachary. 

Finally, the Canadian courts put Turner in jail and granted temporary custody to the parents of Andrew Bagby. However, this did not last long and Turner was released on bail. 

Turner and the Bagby's then shared custody of Zachary, meaning Andrew's parents had to raise his son with his killer.

On a day when Zachary was in Turner's care, Turner drove to her most recent ex's house and, attempting to frame the man, left photos of herself and Zachary and a used tampon. Afterwards, she drugged Zachary and herself with Ativan and jumped into the ocean.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It usually happens in smaller breeds when an anal sac is impacted. The fluids become stagnant which is a perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Bacteria leads to infection, which leads to abscess, which leads to rupture.

This can all be prevented by emptying the sacs regularly. You can have them expressed by a vet or do it at home, there's plenty of videos to teach you how. I have 3 dogs, but only my Yorkie needs routine cleaning.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just playing devil's advocate for a moment...
You said you "can't feel sorry for him for doing that to not only the police, but those people." Even though he was a victim of the same thing on a much larger scale? Didn't his own government send him out and let him be traumatized to the point of PTSD? 

Sorry if that makes no sense, but having no sympathy for this man seems a little obscene to me. All in all, this looks like something that could have and should have been stopped a while ago. He was hurt, and now he's hurt other people to end his pain. It's a shame. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm the type of person who would stop their car for a family of ducks, but I know better than to stop on the lefthand shoulder of a highway. This woman was just looking to do something humane but ended up with the drastic opposite. Hindsight is 20/20, and I bet this girl regrets her navety every day. Unfortunately, regret won't bring back two lives...

However, I think that life in prison is somewhat drastic. This woman had no intent to take any lives or harm anyone in any way. She should have to face some consequences, what they are I have no idea. All I know is that whatever justice it is will be slow. This is the same country that [let a woman take refuge to get away with murder, only then to go on to kill her son and herself,] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Zachary_Turner) after all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So many aspects of this video are rage inducing. Not only was she being disgustingly racist, but she was basically letting her young children play in a parking lot while she screamed swears and slurs in front of them in public. How is that in any way a good example? Those poor kids.

I was also pretty upset about the bystanders. At least two or three people walked by during this video, none of them said or did anything. I'm sitting at my computer itching to scream at this woman to shut the fuck up and take care of her kids. The bystanders are just enabling that kind of behavior. 

The comments on the video are pretty awful too. Just by scanning a few of them, I've seen a bunch of "if black people can say it, why can't white people?!" arguments. This woman wasn't using it in the context those commentors are referring to, she was using it as an attack and an insult. She was trying to belittle his existence as a human being, the arguments being held in the comments are unnecessary.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> when you make a rape joke, a survivor relives in a vivid, Technicolor sound, what was probably the worst memory of his or her life

This shit pisses me off. I don't know who this woman is or what she has gone through, but she has no right to speak for ALL rape survivors.

Case in point: my father was raped (even though as a cishet white boy he couldn't have possibly been raped) by an older neighbor boy as a child. He has struggled with it, gone to therapy for it, and moved past it. It has taken him years of self loathing, alcohol, and hitting bottom before learning to love himself again. He is a survivor. He also thinks rape jokes are hilarious. He made one just the other day about some Game of Thrones character. My sister (somewhat of an SJW, not as crazy as those tumblr types though) called him out on being intensive of rape victims. I just kinda looked at her, confused like, and asked if she realized who she was saying that to.

He also lost his little brother to cancer but still makes cancer jokes.

tl;dr my dad is super chill. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't understand why children need these types of cars. My SO's best friend was killed by a reckless driver whose parents bought him a 2003 Nissan 350Z. While driving home from a party, the driver (16) was speeding down a 30mph road and lost control causing the car to slam into a tree. One passenger, my SO's best friend, was killed instantly along with the driver while the other passenger survived. This car crash, along with a couple others, lead to the strict driving laws implemented in Connecticut.

<TEXT> When I worked at a daycare there were very strict rules. I was never to have more than 4 children under my care at a time and I was never to leave them in a room/outside unsupervised. These simple yet very enforced rules could have saved this little girl's life. I'm not saying the daycare is entirely to blame, because this was an unexpected accident, but precautions should be taken. Children get into some extremely dangerous situations while not even knowing it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, I must have worded that poorly. Of course it's possible for people who haven't experienced an eating disorder to realize it's about control. In fact, I wouldn't have even realized that part if not for doctors telling me. 

What I meant by the "it's really hard to understand" part is more about the experience. Being trapped in a sick mind and creating a sick body is downright terrifying. Anorexics are not happy, every day is a struggle between yourself and the mirror. Glorifying a debilitating disease is an extremely slippery slope.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be 150lbs with a BMI of 27 she'd have to be somewhere around 5'2. A healthy weight for her would be anywhere from 101 to 136lbs.  137lbs to 163lbs would be overweight, and anything 164 or over would be obese. To go from a BMI of 16 when she was 88lbs to a BMI of 27 now is a difference of 62lbs. 

Anorexia is a mental disorder, most mental disorders cannot be cured - only treated. I know from experience that even though people with anorexia go "into recovery," they never truly get better. I find it hard to believe that a person who reached 88lbs bounced up to 150. If she really was anorexic, it seems she replaced that disorder with another. Binge eating is another eating disorder about control, but it has the opposite effect of anorexia.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thing is, unless you've experienced an eating disorder first hand, it's really hard to understand. Media says its about being thin and looking pretty, when in reality it's about control. 

That being said, anybody who tells people who have anorexia or bulimia that they have "thin privilege" needs to be kicked in the fupa. Having a disorder is not fun, it's not a privilege.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally, RF3. Rune Factory games have all the good parts of Harvest Moon games (like getting to know villagers, raising livestock, getting married, having kids) but also adds in fighting and dungeons. Also, it's really easy to raise friend points and love points because rather than giving somebody a gift every day you can do the requests they ask of you in the bulletin board in the center of town. Giving gifts just speeds up the process. 

It comes down to what you're looking for. If you want a laid back experience of running a farm and settling down, ANB is the way to go. If you want to battle/raise monsters, complete dungeons, and marry cute fantasy chicks, Rune Factory is where it's at.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not a problem, I could talk about Harvest Moon all day! 

If ANB is easiest, you should totally go for it. Unlike the older HM games, there is somewhat of a reason behind the game. You are rebuilding a broken town, restoring the buildings and the citizens to their former glory. Although it starts off a little bit slow, you get the hang of it and it gets really fun. Just so you know, things you are handed in older HM games (such as chicken coops and storage sheds) are not given to you. Instead, you have to build them yourself. 

As for RF, the only 2 RF games that are related are RF1 and RF: Frontiers. Seeing and Frontiers is for the Wii, you don't really have to worry about that. RF1, RF2, and RF3 can all be played without having played any of the others beforehand.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What consoles do you have available? 

For Harvest Moon, my 3 personal favorites are Harvest Moon DS, Harvest Moon Grand Bazaar, and Harvest Moon (M)FoMT. Of course, you really can't go wrong with any Harvest Moon game because they're all so damn good. 

Harvest Moon DS is basically AWL, except there are more bachelorettes such as a sleeping princess and a mermaid. As the name states, it is for the DS.

Grand Bazaar is another one of my favorites because it sort of switched up the monotony of the game. Instead of shipping items, you sell them at a weekly bazaar. It is competitive, not only with other villagers but also with yourself. It pushes you to get the best quality products to get the most G and the best stall at the bazaar!

Of course, I'm sure you know how amazing FoMT and MFoMT are if you're already considering bringing one. You really can't beat the classics. I sort of prefer MFoMT over FoMT just because you can be a girl and marry Kappa. I don't know why I love that green dude so much. 

I will say, though, ANB is definitely worth the purchase. The marriage prospects on both sides are very cute, you can also customize your town in a way you've never been able to in Harvest Moon games. 

As for Rune Factory, any of the handheld games are great. (That would be RF1, RF2, and RF3.) My personal favorite is RF3, just because the story line is closely tied to both your character and the town, and also because you are half monster. Of the 3, RF2 is my least favorite because you don't get into actual dungeons until you are married and have a child. 

Sorry if this was too long. In short, buy whatever! You really can't go wrong!

EDIT: If I *had* to choose *one* game for you to take, I'd say RF3! :D

<TEXT> *sorry if this has been covered, but I couldn't find it in the searches*

My father and my sister are going on a month long hiking trip in Yosemite. My father doesn't have a camera so he always borrows mine when he goes on hiking trips. His birthday is later this month, so I'm hoping to get him a camera for his trip. He is a bit technologically impaired, but my sister will be there to help him out. It doesn't have to be too expensive, I'm just looking for something that will get decent quality and had some durability to it. Also, good battery life is a plus. They have their packs carefully planned so it shouldn't weigh too much.

If anybody has any suggestions about the cameras they use on a hike I'd love to hear! Thank you. </TEXT>

You'll get to see her smile, you'll get to see her grow. Sure, you'll piss each other off and get into fights but she's your little girl and she needs to know you love her.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Volcanoes. I live in an area where there are no volcanoes, at all. Nothing even resembling one, but every hill I saw was a volcano to me.

It started in Kindergarten when my teacher showed a video about them. All I can remember is a vague story about a tribe on an island in Hawai'i who got the shit burned out of them by lava. I couldn't stand the color red after that. My dad had fun with it, though. I would always ask if a hill or tiny mountain was a volcano and he'd say it was and watch me cry. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not me, but my sister. 

When we were kids we shared a bunk bed, she slept on the top bunk and I slept on the bottom. One night I hear a loud thud and find my sister on the floor, still asleep. She had rolled over the barrier and on to the floor, about a 6 foot drop. The sound was loud enough to wake me up and send my mother running to our room. She was fine and didn't even realize what had happened.

As for me, I once went to a Bare Naked Ladies concert and I had seats maybe 20 rows from the front. I had a migraine so I fell asleep while the opener was playing and slept through the rest of the show. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Idk OP's curvature, but usually if it's 25 degrees you should do occasional check ups and x-rays. 25-40 degrees you may need a brace. Anything more than 40 degrees and surgery is an option. Since you're over 30 and you've already stopped growing your spine likely won't worsen unless you have a curved spine 40 degrees or above. 

I'm around 27 degrees, and I stopped growing at 15 so there was nothing that could be done. Too late for a brace, and not severe enough for surgery.

<TEXT> BC - most often only people in relationships with active sex lives are on them ... I assume you're not her lover as well? Why worry about it? But you can get it at literally any pharmacy.

Birth control also helps to regulate excessively heavy periods and period complications. Some women take it even when not in a relationship to manage those problems, so even if she didn't have a boyfriend she might still need it.

Thank you, though! I'm pretty sure she's applying to Yonsei and I am applying to Korea U. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Questions about studying abroad in South Korea </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-03-21 15:42:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My friend and I are planning to study abroad in South Korea next Spring semester, so in about a year. Last night she messaged me in a panic, saying that she had been reading up on a couple of things. 

First of all, she is concerned about the laws there. She has said to me that many of the laws there are similar to in the U.S (where we both live) but there are bound to be some differences. One thing she is worried about is the legality of her birth control. Is birth control legal there, and what other laws should we know about that are different from in the U.S?

Second, she was telling me that you need to prove that you have a large sum of money in order to get a visa. I'm not quite sure what type of visa she's talking about, be it student or work, but is that true?

Next, she is worried about Japanese Encephalitis. How prominent is that there, should we be worried? She said that it is advised to carry bug spray, but is there anything else we can do about it?

Finally, she read somewhere that the bird flu is still a major problem there. She advised that we keep away from open air markets (which I was planning to do anyway because I'm a very picky eater.) Is bird flu really that big of a problem there? Should we stay away from anything else other than open air markets?

Those are the things she voiced to me, if there is any other advice you may have about studying abroud please let me know :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it depends on the environment the high school is in. I went to a middle-class suburban high school and it was a nightmare. All the cliche tanned white girls in Ugg boots and yoga pants were spitting images of Regina George. As a quiet, short, pale girl I stood out, even though I tried my hardest to fade into the background.

My freshman year I was in AP Bio (which was usually reserved for sophomores and juniors) and one of the sophomores didn't like me all that much. I don't know why, I've been told many reasons. (My eyes are "mean," I'm too quiet, I'm too different, so on...) She and her friends sort of rallied together to hate me. I would get hate messages on Myspace and harassed in school. I remember dissecting frogs in the Bio class and the leader of their group throwing frog parts at me. 

One day I was unable to sit at my regular table at lunch because somebody else was there, so I sat at an empty one. As fate would have it, it was "her" table. She threw a fit and sat at the table directly next to me. I was sitting with my older sister and one other friend, eating a pretzel and trying to ignore her. But of course, she was making rude comments quite loudly, even over the noise of the cafe. I was used to her comments about me, but when she started to attack my sister I flipped. I had a mouth full of pretzel and spit it at her face. We were both escorted out of the cafeteria, the whole place was clapping. I'm still not sure if they were clapping because I spit at her or because I was in trouble...

Of course, me standing up to her with my mouth didn't really help the situation. They took the entire thing to the internet, telling me day and night to kill myself. I would respond with typical "high school" things, like telling them to get fucked by a big dildo. (That comment actually got me suspended, when their encouraging me to kill myself did nothing to them.) Once I learned that the school would rather punish me to maintain the status quo than actually stand up for me I fell into a depression. I did eventually attempt suicide and ended up in the hospital for the last month of my sophomore year. After that, I dropped out of school. (No worries though, I went to tutoring and then an alternative school so I graduated on time.)

I still see some of these girls around, although one died soon after. I can't say I mourned her death, I just wish she had lived a bit longer to understand the effect her actions had on others.

**tl;dr:** my high school experience was pretty bad for me  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm 20, but I've been very doubtful towards theism for as long as I can remember. My mother sent me to Sunday school when I was a child but I got kicked out of multiple classes. (The rebellious atheist stage is great when you get it out of the way at a young age.) My mother said she would accept me being any religion (or lack thereof) if I completed my Confirmation in the Catholic church. To get her off my back I sat through the classes with my mouth shut and went through with the ceremony. After that I renounced any connection to the Catholic church. I was still nervous about calling myself an atheist due to the "what ifs," but then I just said "fuck it." 

My father was a lot more accepting, he renounced his religion in 2001 after the towers fell. He said that no world with a god would allow that. I'm glad that he came out as an atheist, because he convinced my mother to stop subjecting my siblings and I to church every weekend. I haven't been to a Sunday mass (other than my grandfathers funeral, out of respect) since 2001. He says that my only duty as an atheist is to continue my lineage. That's lot less pressure than preserving my soul or saving another.

Whether you find atheism earlier in life or later, it's still a journey. Yes, in the beginning it's scary, especially if you've lived your life with the safety net of religion, but the beauty of a life free of that burden is truly amazing. </TEXT>

She then claimed that her twin sister had the same name as her, only spelled slightly differently. Getting a little odd at this point. She *then* told me that her twin sister was cryogenically frozen at birth and then "defrosted" 5 years later, so her twin sister is technically 5 years younger than her.

She also claimed that Jack Skellington was her father and Robert Pattinson was her cousin.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The cosplay community is extremely judgmental and bigoted. 

If you are cosplaying a character that has light skin, you better not have dark skin! If you are cosplaying a thin girl, you better not be overweight! It is a sin to use your real hair! If your costumes are not hand-made then you are a fake! Your props must be as accurate as possible! 

People in the cosplay community seem to forget they we all started to have fun with it. There's nothing wrong if a black person wants to cosplay a fair skinned person, and there's nothing wrong with a heavier person cosplaying a skinny person. If you don't like their cosplay, don't look at it. Telling them to kill themselves over a fucking costume is pathetic. You are not any better than them for having a better costume. I'd much rather be friends with a cosplayer who does it for the love of that character rather than an elitist douche.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have no idea what's going on with the judges. The moth was probably one of the worst things I've seen on this show so far. Not only that, but Megan was the other half of the failing duo last week. I can't see why she is still on the show. Plus, they said that the winner wasn't really the winner because he didn't incorporate the photo elements? I've seen the judges on FaceOff give the win to people who haven't met the needs of the challenge but made a kick ass makeup plenty of times. What was different this time? I'm really not too pleased with this season.

As for the question between solo and partner, it's really hard. In solo we're able to see their creative abilities as well as execution come to light. They also have nobody to blame for their shortcomings. In a partner challenge, they can always throw the other person under the bus. Partner challenges are usually a hit or miss for me. In order to work well together they have to make it flow. You shouldn't be able to tell who did what part of the makeup. When collaborations are good, they are *good*, but when they are bad, they are **bad**. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I found the video interesting. Japan is the least racially diverse of all first world countries, so it's probably expected that Japanese students don't notice racism. If you're not the target, you don't usually pay attention to it. Other countries that are far more diverse notice a lot more racism due to clashing issues and mixing of cultures. As for the discrimination portion due to economic background/geographical location, that happens in every country. I know people in the U.S who hate southerners because they are seen as "stupid" and "inbred."
 
It's always difficult for a culture to accept that they have problems like this, especially very proud cultures. Even if you say something that is so blatantly obvious, there will still be people there to oppose you. It took the U.S longer than we'd like to admit to acknowledge our rampant racism, and we're still working on it. It's clear that not all citizens of Japan are blind to the discrimination, but it takes time to change. Keep trying to educate those who will listen, most of the time those who won't aren't worth your time anyway. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In terms of technique and execution I love Zelo from B.A.P. He goes so quickly and it literally blows my mind. As for writing, I'm quite partial to the raps the T.O.P writes. He also has that deep voice that's perfect for rapping, flows like chocolate. Zico of Block B is another male favorite, just due to is general confidence and wow factor. If these three somehow fused together, I would probably explode of happiness. (That and the sex appeal would the through the roof.)

As for female rappers, Amber of f(x) is a really good one. Lim of the Wonder Girls did an amazing rap in Act Cool which really gained my respect. Of course CL has to be another one of my female favorites. 

I can't really pick a ultimate favorite of any gender, but these are my general top picks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember reading on reddit a couple months back that some pet foods and snacks from China have been a major cause in the drastic increase of liver failure / other complications in dogs.

Shortly after that story, my 7 year old Aussie began to get sick with similar symptoms. Luckily he went to the vet in time. He is now on a special diet to help, but the vet said his life expectancy has likely been shortened by a couple years. Since then I have been very careful about what I feed him and my other dogs. I urge other pet owners to do the same. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Coming from the sister of somebody with an eating disorder: you cannot help by yourself. Unless you have gone to school and specialized in the complex area that is eating disorders, you are in no way able to comprehend what she is thinking. I know that, as a sister, you want to be there and you should be, but don't be surprised when she pushes you away and tells you that you don't understand.

My parents were also very hesitant in accepting that my sister was sick. At first, my mother aided my sister in her endeavor to lose weight, taking her to the gym and buying her low calorie foods. It wasn't until she started showing actual psychological differences that my parents actually took notice. She was hostile and depressed, always working out but whenever she was sitting she had something (a pillow, a book, a bag) over her stomach. We used to be very close, but during that time she became a whole other person. When my parents realized that, they got her to a therapist.

Keep in mind, once your parents notice the journey will still be far from over. You sister needs to accept that she is sick. If it took your parents this long to realize, your sister will take a while as well. The process of her getting to see that is hard. At first, she will not even want to go to therapy. She will claim it is a waste of time. If she is under 18, your parents can force her. Hopefully, she will gradually come to terms with the fact that she is getting help whether she likes it or not. In the case of my sister, we were getting her to realize that she was sick when she flat out lost it. Her therapist and my parents had to have her put into a inpatient program for kids with eating disorders. She resented my mother and father for a long time, she even threatened to kill the therapist, but this was the best thing for her.

After weeks of inpatient and outpatient programs, my sister finally returned home. It has been over 5 years since then, but I know that she still struggles every day. Once you have an eating disorder you always have an eating disorder. You need to keep in mind that eating disorders are less about food and more about control. My sister needed to take control of her life and did it in the wrong way, it seems your sister is too. They are taking food (of the lack thereof) and manipulating it to make themselves feel better. Your sister is sick, and she will need you there for her recovery. Don't get mad when she treats you badly, both her mind and body are warped. Recovery is possible.

My sister is now planning on becoming a therapist and helping kids such as herself. She could probably explain this a lot better than I could.

TL;DR She needs to realize she is sick, you need to be there to help her through.

**EDIT**: I just saw that your sister is 20, which makes things a bit more difficult. It's hard to get a person into therapy when they believe that nothing is wrong. One thing that helped my sister was letting her control other environments of her life. For her, that meant getting a job at a stable and working with the horses. Something like that may seem small to you or I, but it made a huge impact in her life. Although she no longer works with horses, I know she still cares about them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My cat Arwen ran away when I was little. She was a black cat, nothing really to help identify her. One day, my mother came home from the pound with a black cat. She swore to me that it was Arwen. Everybody in the family carried on as usual, happy that their cat had returned. I, on the other hand, refused to believe that it was Arwen. I told my mother again and again it wasn't her and that we should keep looking, but she told me I was just being paranoid. A few days later, Arwen showed up at our back door. When I let her inside, she looked at the new black cat and looked mildly confused but quickly ran to the food bowl. We kept the new cat, and named her Jasmine. (Personally, I wanted to name her Eowyn, but whatever.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mine isn't life or death, but is a string of perfectly timed occurrences.

One day, my boyfriend and I showed up at my fathers house during a big thunderstorm. We were surprised to see him and my older sister outside calling for my dog. Like most dogs, this one was a big sissy when it came to thunderstorms. At this point, the storm had been going on for 10 minutes and showed no signs of stopping. Even after it did, I was driving around my town looking for my dog. When my father finally told me to go and dry off, I went in for the day. The next morning, it started again.

My father and I went together, driving around and asking people if they had seen our dog. I had photos of him to show people. We drove by a work truck and asked the man in there, he said a co-worker of his had a dog jump in his truck during the storm. We asked what kind of a dog, he said "boxer." Our dog is a Australian Shepard, those two look nothing alike so we wrote it off and moved on.

My father had to go to work, so I spent the rest of the morning posting pictures on local facebook pages. One was the town's newspaper page. A woman posted and said she saw my dog a block from my house. She said he was in a parking lot with a truck trying to take shelter from the rain. When she looped around to pick him up, he was gone. She assumed the driver of the truck had taken him in. The truck was from the same company as the man before. I called my dad, who called the company who told us this amazing story.

Apparently, the driver of that truck was there in that parking lot waiting out the storm. Our dog jumped into the bed of his truck to hide, without the driver knowing. As the storm eased up, the driver drove away with our dog in the back. He traveled 30 miles with our dog unsecured in the back, cars beeping at him and waving at him. When he finally stopped, our dog jumped out and ran.

Luckily for us, we knew exactly where our dog had left the truck, and with the help of local police we had him safe and sound at home that night. [Here he is after his vet visit.](http://i.imgur.com/0YoUe.jpg)

tl;dr: my dog hitched a ride 30 miles to hide from a storm, we managed to find him with good samaritans.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Hobbit   Lord of the Rings. My father read them to my older sister and I when we were children. When the first movie came out and McDonalds was giving out LoTR toys I got really mad because as a 3rd or 4th grader it was something I imagined was only for my dad, my sister and I. 

I also had a weird kiddy-crush on Legolas (the character, not Orlando Bloom) when my dad read us the books. Then Mr. Bloom in a wig comes along and makes all those girls swoon. D: </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure where you work but the Special Education system in my area is probably the shittiest thing I've ever had to go through. It's not my own experience alone, but the experience of my brother as well.

In my high school days I was severely depressed and I was finally diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder when I turned 18. Before the diagnosis, my teachers didn't know what to do with me because I was either acting out or sleeping through class. They put me into a "special program" in order to help me. There was really nothing special about it, seeing as the people who were supposed to check up on me never did and I ended up dropping out.

My brother has been an odd child since he was born, and in about 2nd grade it was determined he was Autistic. Not so bad to the point where he couldn't talk, but he is a social recluse, extremely awkward, and couldn't read/write until about 5th grade. He had an aid for most of his middle school years, and due to the lack of help that I got at my high school he went to another one in a different town where they assured he would be taken care of. As of right now he is a junior and I hear all the time how he is bullied. I have recently learned that the person who was his aid through freshman and sophomore year got fired and replaced due to the poor performance rating of the school. Since they were let go, it seems my brother has been forgotten about. We no longer get updates on his progress and I don't think he's getting the counseling he needs any more.

As you may be able to tell, I have little faith in the special education system. My question to you is, do you have faith in it? I know as a special ed teacher you must have some, but do you ever see the students you are supposed to be helping forgotten about either by the teachers faults or the fault of the system? </TEXT>

<TEXT> *How I discovered KPop:*

My friends and I were sitting around a computer late at night surfing through youtube. Somehow we ended up on Haru Haru and we were all in love. We scrolled through the related videos for hours. This was right around 2ne1's debut, so we watched Fire over and over. That night we discovered some of my favorite bands, BigBang, Wonder Girls, 2ne1, Girls Generation, Super Junior, and so on. In all honesty, I'm happier than I've ever been since I found kpop. It sounds lame, but the obsession that my friends and I all share has brought us closer together.

*How I discovered /r/kpop:* 

At first I didn't really understand reddit. I didn't know you could subscribe to subreddits, or unsubscribe from the default ones. About a month into my membership, I was getting the hang of it and started following literally everything that interested me. Of course I subscribed to /r/kpop. I also subscribed to /r/asianladyboners, which has a lot of those sexy kpop stars. I don't really post on this subreddit a lot but I love it when it shows up on my front page. If I don't have the time or forget to check koreaboo/allkpop, I get my news here. It's actually quite convenient. Thanks to all those people who keep this subreddit up to date! </TEXT>

<TEXT> This happened to me as well, although I'm pretty sure I'm one of the few success stories. It was my lab account and had a lot of NP / priceless items, so I was really upset. Although, the only thing I wanted from the account was the RN RG Kacheek named after my sister. I told them what happened and they froze the account, and after about 6 months they granted the account back to me. I was lucky none of my pets were transferred away, but I was out about 2mil. Oh well.

In order to further protect myself from future incidents like this I no longer keep my passwords saved and I always log out. I also make sure anything I click on the site does not direct me to another site or anything like that, because that can lead to password phishing. It's kind of pathetic that people use those skills on Neopets of all places.

I would just say to keep pestering them, otherwise they'll forget it and move on. Provide as much information as you can (dates, times, usernames, accounts, etc) and it should work. Keep in mind, TNT is not very good at quick results.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's Adalia's mother who has to deal with all the hate she gets from kids like these. Not only is she going to outlive her child but now she has to see people say terrible things about her. Their will seems to be to make Adalia and Natalia feel bad, which is exactly what they are achieving.

I would also like to add that I in no way support what Natalia is doing to her daughter by making her an internet icon for Progeria. It's sort of a shame that she's being so exposed, at least in my opinion. It's also rude for her to ask people to tell her that her daughter is beautiful - because by social standards she is no way *physically beautiful*. She may be beautiful on the inside, I can't tell you that because I don't know the girl. What I can say is people like the girl in this picture may be beautiful on the outside, but they are in no way beautiful on the inside. I suppose I could say that they look on the inside the way Adalia does on the outside. </TEXT>

You're at the age where you're just discovering what life has to offer. Don't limit yourself to just one thing right now.

<TEXT> You sound like me at 16. I got out of bed, went to school, and left early due to stress-migraines. I never stayed past lunch time. Once I was home, I would crawl into bed and sleep until it was time to start the cycle over again. As stated earlier, I dropped out of school soon after. Once I was out of school, away from that environment I found a sense of freedom and actual happiness. After a while out of school I found enough courage to complete it. That was what worked for me, and I have no idea what will work for you. You will never know until you try. 

At 16 years old, nothing feels like it will ever get better. From what I've experienced, it does get better. It gets a lot better! Don't do anything for anybody else, do everything for you. If you are happy then it will spread to the people around you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> From what you've said, they seem a bit hypocritical. They tell you to go do something you enjoy - but only if you can get a career from it? What are you, 18 or 19? You don't need a career right now! You need to live your live and experience a little bit of everything. 

I don't believe you'll disappoint them, I think they're just worried about your future. The world is a scary place and it seems like they'd rather you be in a stable environment. That's just what parents do, it's their job to worry about your future and hope for the best. The thing is, you do not have to listen to them. I'm not sure if a child can ever disappoint their parents, at least not for long. 

My grandfather went to Yale and hoped that his sons would follow in his footsteps. The fact that his younger son died of cancer only heightened his expectations for the other boys. My father wanted nothing to do with that, instead he threw away the Yale legacy and chose a smaller college and got a degree in botany - very different from the doctorate degree in engineering that his father held. This gave the other boys the courage to follow their own dreams. None of them went to Yale and none of them cured cancer, but their father still loves them all.

They just want you to be happy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hate it when people say that to me. I've had therapists say things like, "you have no reason to be sad!" I feel like out of all the people out there, a therapist would know that there doesn't have to be *severe* emotional trauma to be depressed. It's something that happens, to some people more than others. Sure, I have thought that I have "no right" to be as sad as I am, but I'm not going to deny these feelings and neither should you.

As a human being, you have every right to feel what you feel and express it the way you want. However, life is a two-way street and others have every right to tell you to "toughen up." My advice? Fuck 'em. They're not inside your head and they can't comprehend what goes on in there. Heck, half the time I have no idea what's going on in my own head.

In my opinion, you don't need to toughen up. You already seem tough enough, you just need to keep your head up a little bit longer. I know this is hard but life is difficult at times. Smile about the little things, enjoy everything while you can. You never know what will happen next, things might get better, or things might get worse - but they will change. Most of that change is up to you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all, your parents need to realize that you are a separate being from them. Yes, they created you but they cannot in any way experience your life. Sure, they're probably just doing what they think is best for you but how would they know that? Only you know what is best for you. I hate to use this term, but you only live once. If you don't want to be in school right now, don't waste your time with it and hope that you find your calling. That's not how life works.

For instance, I found my passion after a huge mental break down and a  failed suicide attempt. (Never use Tylenol, it is slow acting and will only shut down a couple of organs causing a painful and prolonged death. Luckily I was found in time to be helped.) Anyway, after a short time in inpatient care and months of outpatient, my parents thought it was best I found something to occupy my time. I had already dropped out of school so they suggested community service. There is a local charity in my town that helps raise money for the homeless every October through a haunted house. I figured I might as well do something while everybody else was finishing up school. A friend took me down there, and I fell in love. After months of building throughout the summer I got to know the owner and I was a scare actress all October. I never thought I would find myself in a place like that but life has a way of surprising you.

I am now in college for creative writing and I hope to some day be able to scare millions of people with my stories. I hope you are able to find the same passion I have. Don't go looking for it - it will find you. I suggest you talk to your parents and tell them you want to find yourself. Assure them that you are not giving up, but let them know that college isn't the only road to happiness. If they want you to be happy they will agree. (Probably not at first though!) Show them you mean what you say and then go on an adventure. 

If you need somebody to talk to, there are many genuine people on Reddit. That includes me. :)

<TEXT> I know this is three months late but I thought I would share.

When I was a a freshman in high school I was tormented by a group of girls in my AP bio class. The way the curriculum in my town is set up, that is mostly for sophomore students. I had transferred from a different school in a different town earlier that year (due to bullying - go figure,) so an exception was made for me. I don't know if it was because the girls felt threatened by a younger student being in their class, or maybe because they didn't like my face (I've been told I have a constant scowl on my face and intimidating eyes,) either way they decided to hate me. Two girls from my bio class would give me dirty looks and laugh whenever I passed by, but it was something I was used to so I let it slip. They were the standard "popular girls" you see in a movie, the tanned to the bone type with a ringleader, a lackey, and multiple followers.

I began to receive random friend requests on social media sites and I was hopeful that people from my new school wanted to be friends with me. Well, I was wrong. I got constant messages and comments from the two girls and their friends. (I should probably mention that this was around the fall of myspace and the rise of facebook, so most of the bullying happened online.) This was over 4 years ago so the conversations aren't fresh in my mind, but there are still snippets that I remember clearly. Most of the comments consisted of the classic "you're an ugly bitch!" and evolved into "you don't have any friends" sometimes degrading into "kill yourself, nobody would even come to your funeral!"

I never had any real encounters with them until the week before Christmas break my freshman year. I was looking for a place to eat lunch, I usually ate with my older sister in the hallway but somebody had been pestering us so we went into the lunch room. We saw an empty table, and since it was already half way through the lunch period we figured nobody else would be sitting there. I bought a pretzel and sat down. Next thing I know, the two girls from my bio class were sitting at the table across from me and staring daggers. I continued eating, but they didn't look away. I look up again and we make eye contact, the ring leader started yelling at my sister and I. She called my sister names and told us we had taken her table. I still had a mouth full of pretzel when she was yelling at my sister, so I stood up and spit a whole chunk in her face. She screamed and security escorted me out of the cafeteria. I don't know if the lunch room was clapping because I was being escorted out by the Rent-a-Cop or because I had spit at the bitchy popular girls. I was not suspended because it was so close to Christmas vacation.

What I didn't realize at that moment was the fact that since I had reacted to their bullying that would only fuel the fire. Over Christmas break I got more and more messages from the girls, many from a girl I had never met before. I'm not going to post her name here, but it started with an M. M went on and on about what a disgusting person I was. I snapped, after the messages from earlier in the school year, the rumors they spread, the sniggers and giggles behind my back, the shouts across the hallway, and finally the incident the week before I refused to take any more. I told her flat out that she and her friends should just die and make the world a better place. She didn't message me back after that. In fact, she didn't come to school after that. She died later that year due to a heart disease that she had been struggling with in secret all her life. She was only 16 years old.

When I heard that she had died I was overcome with a lot of emotions. At first, I was elated. I thought she had gotten what she deserved, I felt that I had won. After a bit of time, I cried. I came to realize that she was a girl who hadn't even gotten to live her life yet, she was a beautiful person, maybe not mentally but physically she was gorgeous. I thought about the things she was going to miss out on and the roads her life could have taken. In my mind, she is no longer my bully or my enemy but a fellow human being. I wish she was here to grow up and maybe see the mistakes she had made and repent for them. I've already forgiven her.

I regret the words I used that day and I'm glad, for your sake - not theirs, that you didn't didn't get a chance to follow through with your plan.

**TL;DR:** I told a bully I wished she was dead and she died shortly after. Crazy realization ensued. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My heart sank while reading this. I know as a single human being I can't even make a dent in all the terrible things that we do to one another, and I know I haven't been the best person either. After reading all the tweets last night, a the ones specifically mentioning Hiroshima and Nagasaki were the ones that offended me. It being 3 am combined with the fact that I had slept all day, I decided it might be beneficial to reply to the people who had spouted such offensive nonsense. I went to Hiroshima and Nagasaki websites and found medical photos of the victims and sent them to the original tweeters. The way I saw it, maybe if they saw that the events they were joking about contained real people who suffered extreme pain, they might think differently.

[This](http://imgur.com/5DFTC) was the conversation I had with one of the boys whose tweets you can see on that article. I was extremely discouraged with the fact that he continued to joke and try to validate his opinions, even try to persuade me at one point. I took these screenshots to send to his mother and father. After I told him that, he deleted all the posts. Later on today we had [this](http://imgur.com/ya03k) conversation with him and another friend. I'm not saying I feel defeated, because maybe the things I've said will settle in the back of his mind and one day he'll have an epiphany - but that's nowhere close in the future. The sad thing is, this boy is 17 years old. No 17 year old should be filled with so much hatred for a country that did nothing other to him than make the cars that killed his friends dog. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's true, I didn't take into account that the picture could be quite old. Also, after a quick internet search I found a [$30 fetal pig dissection kit](http://www.enasco.com/product/LS03815M) complete with a (from what I can tell, real) 4"-7" preserved fetal pig. Even though what you said earlier about how going to a butcher would be easier is true, apparently it's easier to get preserved fetal pigs than I had thought.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree, for the most part. Depending on where OP lives and what schedule his school follows (if he is a high school student) this could be very true. Although, when I was in high school we saved dissecting pigs and cats for much later in the year. If he lives in the US, that doesn't seem to add up because most high schools are on summer break or just starting back up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> True, Hiroshima and Nagasaki should not have even been brought into the conversation. A lot of the tweets said "that was for Pearl Harbor!" which in reality is pretty harmless. If you feel that the lives of your people are equal to winning one soccer game, I'm not going to stop you from thinking that. I'll tell you you're wrong, but I can't stop you. The tweets that offended me were the ones that said something along the lines of "I haven't seen Japs cry like that since Hiroshima." If the situation were reversed, and a whole bunch of Japanese teens tweeted "Haven't seen whites cry like that since Pearl Harbor" there would be an outrage. Much bigger than the one we have on our hands here.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand where you're coming from completely. Although I don't think I'm "buying into" anything, per se. I don't believe there should be a score board, but people see it that way. It's just the truth that Americans resent the Japanese because of something that happened 70 years ago. If something I've said can possibly influence them to be a little bit nicer or think about what they say before they've said it (and make an ass out of themselves) then I've done something to be proud of. I know I can't change everybody. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 2,390 US citizens   soliders died and 1,178 were wounded on December 7th 1941. 64 Japanese soliders were killed and 5 were wounded. 

In early August of 1945, Hiroshima had an estimated population of 255,000 and Nagasaki had an estimated population of 195,000. After the bombings, Hiroshima had at least 66,000 dead (although there are estimates that go up to as much as 140,000 deaths) and 69,000 injured (not to mention future injuries due to radiation) while Nagasaki had at least 39,000 dead and 25,000 injured. 
To understand the suffering that the Japanese felt, think of this. If you were between 0-1000 ft of where the bomb was dropped, you would have a 93% mortality rate. 60% of the deaths in Hiroshima were caused by radiation burns, but in Nagasaki 95% of the deaths were caused by radiation burns. 

By looking at the bare minimum of the dead and wounded in both these events, 102,615 more Japanese died and 92,886 more Japanese were injured. It's a shame that all these human deaths are no more than notches on a score board, but that is the way the US seems to look at it - and we won. There is no questioning who went through more pain. Even today, almost 70 years later the Japanese have health problems due to lingering radiation. I can't even begin to understand how many deaths due to cancer or other things were caused by the bombings. 

It's disgusting that people in the US can be so rude and inconsiderate about something that they likely weren't even alive for. I know WWII veterans and they would never go on twitter and say "LOL THATZ 4 MY BUDDY ON THE ARIZONA. #wantsomewaterforthatburn" - even if they knew how to work twitter. It adds insult to injury when people do something so unnecessary. Good for you, your country killed hundreds of thousands of civilians and then beat their grand children in a soccer game. Feel good?

<TEXT> Because the US is no longer a "melting pot" it's more like a mold. KPOP has a thing for pushing the envelope, trying new things, and making it their own. Music in the US uses the same tactic to get a hit single every time. I can honestly admit that I *am* being biased, I have no objections to that. If it becomes a little bit more popular then I have no problems with that, but if I wake up every morning to see the thing I've been so passionate about for so long, I'm bound to start to hate it. It's similar to setting your favorite song as your alarm clock. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep, mainly. Also I'm sort of upset after learning today that most Kpop fans are apparently jerks like you. By that I mean, I thought that the KPOP community was tight-knit and we all found something in common to bond over. I figured even though there were band rivalries, a lot of the fans would stick together. 

That's the thing I don't want to see shattered. I've never been in a "fandom" or anything else like this before, and it was something special to me. The US media has a habit of taking things that are amazing, wringing them out like a towel, and moving on to the next thing. I would never want that to happen to KPOP.

Although, after today, with people like you I am somewhat surprised. Apparently the KPOP fandom is not really all that nice. Still, with the friends I've made from KPOP it is something I just don't want to see ruined. Maybe somebody like you couldn't understand that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One phrase that really bugs me is "where are you going?" The customers are either complete assholes due to their fear, or absolute idiots. By asking them where they are going you're going to run into one of two problems. First off, they can be rude and say something along the lines of, "I'm going where I'm supposed to, where do you think I'm going?" That causes unneeded confrontation and should probably be avoided. Second, they can become confused and begin to think they are actually going the wrong way. That can lead customers to take a wrong turn through a character door or an emergency exit which is annoying for the actors and ruins the mood for the customers.  </TEXT>

I just finished Majora's Mask for the first time in a while, and I was so annoyed at how often Tatl would go "DING!" I'm sure if you took a shot every time she did that you'd die. That goes for the guides for any of the console games, (Navi, Tatl, Midna, Fi, ect.)

Other possibilities could be:

Down a bottle when you die

Take a sip when you roll because you think rolling makes you go faster

Finish your drink when you're about to enter a boss chamber

Find an important item? (heart piece, whole heart, map, compass, weapon) take a shot!

If you're playing Skyward Sword, take a shot every time you jump off Skyloft and don't summon your Loftwing

Take a sip every time you make Epona run out of carrots

Sidequest? SHOTS! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bipolar disorder is harder to diagnose, if she is under 18 she cannot be legally diagnosed as bipolar. It can be suspected, but the DM-IV says it shouldn't be diagnosed at that time. Because of that, most teens showing bipolar tendencies are just written off as depressed. Bipolar is different from depression because the subject displays periods of depression, and manic episodes. If she is unusually sad for some time, and the next week she is unusually happy, it's safe to assume she is bipolar. That being said, it doesn't really matter what the diagnosis is. Self harm is dangerous and if she is not getting help then she should do so. She will not appreciate it, but that's because she is sick. When she begins to get better is when she will thank you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's one movie that my current boyfriend showed me before we dated. My situation at the time was not the greatest and I was in and out of hospital and inpatient care. This movie just struck me. It's called Synecdoche, New York.

<TEXT> Talk to him. He probably feels isolated and alone. Even if the cops said everything your father did was technically legal, the years of emotional and physical abuse have probably left him with some scars. The least you could do after choosing sides and ignoring him is reach out a helping hand. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on what she likes, I suppose. For my boyfriend's last birthday I got him a couple of his favorite dishes from this weird restaurant he loves. I hate it, so we never go, but the least I could do was get him some baba ghanoush. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hate saliva outside the mouth. It leaves this weird sensation when it's on my body and it gets cold and gross way too fast. I've never been able to understand why people like sloppy kisses or huge hickeys. The texture and temperature of saliva is something I cannot stand, I shudder at the thought of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't want to retype the whole story, so here's a post I made the night it happened.

My brother started having night terrors when he was younger, they usually consisted of him crying and asking odd questions. After consoling him, everything was fine and he usually went back to sleep. He is now 16 and hasn't had a night terror in years, until tonight.

At around 1:30am I was asleep in bed but woke up to hear my brother screaming and run into the bathroom outside my room. He had not been feeling well earlier that evening so I assumed he was going to throw up in the toilet and be on his merry way. I then heard him run downstairs, it sounded like he was running into walls. My mother woke up and tried to console him, she asked him what was wrong and he replied, "I have to kill myself." At this point, I knew something was wrong so I got out of bed and went downstairs. I saw my mother in awe of the situation and my brother breathing heavily. He looked like he didn't know where he was or what was going on.

I went to him and tried to talk him down, he wasn't listening to me. He just kept insisting that he had to kill himself. Terrified, I asked my mother if we should wake him up with water before he did anything. She refused, and tried to pat his back to calm him down. This startled him, and he began to pick things up and throw them around the room. He lifted a couch at one point, but my mom pulled him away before he could flip it. He then went for a shoe-rack and threw it at me. After being hit, I grabbed my dog and ran upstairs to put him out of harms way.

When I returned from putting my dog in my room, I saw my brother run into our kitchen. There was a huge crash and the sound of broken glass, and then the lights went out. I heard one more time, "I have to kill myself," as my brother crawled towards me. He sat on the floor in silence. Apparently he woke up when he was on the floor, because he stopped freaking out. I asked him if he knew where he was, he said he did. I asked him if he was okay, he said he didn't know. My mother grabbed a flashlight and went into the darkened kitchen to find a hole in our back window with glass all over the floor. Judging by the blood on his forehead, my brother had slammed his head into the glass.

I told my mother we should call and ambulance and have him taken to the psych ward. She said she'd take him to the doctors tomorrow. My brother is now too scared to go back to sleep. He said that there was a number looming over him and the only way to get rid of it was to kill himself. He said there were no voices, no shadows, just a number he didn't know above him.

<TEXT> My SO is very into UFC. I get bored with it, but I turn it on for him. Although, we don't usually watch too much of it. I always ask too many questions and we wrestle. He knows all the stupid UFC moves so I end up looking like an ass and almost passing out. It's fun though! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get migraines quite often, and I've learned to convince myself that they don't hurt. It only works some of the time, usually on my less severe migraines. I think it's more of me distracting myself from the pain rather than not feeling any pain at all. That being said, the mind can do amazing things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tell her how you feel. She has the power to end the engagement, and if you're there to support her and love her she can make it through. Even if she calls off the marriage you don't have to marry her immediately. You two can date casually or whatever. If her family feels bad about it, be a man and sit down and talk to them. If you are serious about her, tell them that you want to better your future for the two of you. In the end, you and her family both want the best for her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Then you are fine. Even if the police do come looking for you, they won't have much evidence to go on. She probably won't even call the police, unless she wants to be viewed as a woman who hooks up with random men online. Also, the police have better things to do than go and get a warrant for a guy they don't know the name of to find a wallet. They'll probably recommend she cancel her credit card and be on their merry way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Did you two just hook up or is there money involved? As long as the sex you two had was legal and consensual, you should either call the police and report her for harassment or just ignore it. If you didn't take her wallet (and if the sex was legal) she has nothing on you. She's probably just trying to scam you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have had the same feelings with my current boyfriend. He had a past full of flings and one ended in a child being conceived. I don't hold any of it against him, because I love him. I realized that I was insecure because I was worried that I was not as good as the rest. All I know is that he chose me and we're happy. There's no reason that you should hold her past against her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on who is complimenting me.
If it is my family member, I usually just say thank you because I know that even if they were lying they would never admit it.
If it is a person I just met (especially a guy) I don't tend to believe them. They usually have no backing to their compliment, and most times they just want to get on my good side.
If it is a close friend, I take what they say to heart. I know these people wouldn't lie to me. They compliment me because they want to, not because they feel obligated to. </TEXT>
