<TEXT> Hmm always wondered myself about those date codes and tyre evolution - are there any 'average' type tyres that you found changed significantly over time? Ie. not slicks/track tyres. I've heard on the grapevine that the old Bridgestone RE050s changed a lot since they were an OEM tyre on plenty of cars but I have no sources to back it up.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh and don't go by what an owner may claim. Most owners will not know about a car's issues unless they actively work on it themselves, especially with these types of cars. I've looked at so many cars with so called full service histories, and they are sometimes worse than those with no history at all.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It would be a Liberty not a Legacy. I would not by any means take out a loan for this car. Can almost guarantee something will break and you will not be able to afford it unless you do the work yourself (in which case yes, it can be very cheap to run and maintain). 

$5,500 is also way too much for a Gen 3 even if it is that clean. You can easily buy a Gen 4 for that much, I almost sold mine for a touch more and it's ridiculously clean compared to the average Gen 4. 

As someone with 2 Libertys and someone also looking to buy another one, I would never buy a Gen 3 for that much unless it was a clean B4 (even then it would not be an easy yes).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just had a similar issue myself. TPG was quick to send their own technician to check the lines and I got the all clear on my end, they blamed Telstra (issue outside the premises). Telstra was a mess to deal with but eventually admitted fault on their end (just this morning, after about a month of complaints). 

Check your home phone connection, assuming you have one. Mine was dropping out every day from around 9AM to 5PM, sometimes taking the DSL connection along with it, or slowing it to a standstill. There was also a lot of noise on the line when it was connected. Do what others have said here to check your own end before going elsewhere.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's like they make it intentionally grindy and inconvenient to make money normally so you're pressured into buying shark cards which in themself are poor value unless they are on sale.

I truly believe they make this game extremely frustrating like this on purpose. It feels like every legitimate money making method on this game is somehow subdued and attached to some time limit instead so that you're forced to grind for hours regardless of how efficient you are. Example: mission (un)replayability, crate or vehicle buy/sell timers. What on earth is the purpose of this other than to simply stop you making money? I'd like to think people could make so much more legitimate money if these artificial and unnecessary timers were history. If people want to be super efficient just let them... but of course that wouldn't sell cards would it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, not OP here but I also was working on an Apoc 'cover' some time ago but never got around to properly finishing it because the percussion in general was pretty pathetic - it sounds pretty horrible and takes way too long to translate into sheet music since it was all made in Guitar Pro (yes I realise you're not supposed to create music in this). The last bit of progress on it was a few months ago: https://soundcloud.com/turbolag/tame-impala-apocalypse-dreams-unfinished

Just wondering if I could use your drum track as well? Will give you full credit there of course! Your cover is fantastic too, I like how it isn't just a full copy of the song which is what I was going for.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've found the same thing. A lot of them were expecting for the course to be around half-half with locals and internationals, and they too are disappointed. They're mostly super nice and of course there's a few outliers - but that goes for just about any set of people. Honestly I find myself feeling a lot more comfortable around them compared to some of the typical locals (since I'm of Asian background).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep - I'm not blaming the students one bit. It's the uni who decided to take them in after "knowing" their language skills (after assessing their IELTS I presume). It puts a lot of strain on the one who is most competent at their language. I honestly believe I'd be better off working alone without them since they're more of a net drain, just because I spend so much time correcting them, and like you, I don't want my grades dragged down. I too have no idea how they pass exams; however some seem to be absolutely amazing at rote learning, major props to them since it's something I sure as hell wouldn't be able to do. I go out of my way to "teach" English to the few that really do want to learn, since I can tell they are genuinely interested in understanding more of the language here. After talking to a few of them, they claim that they're fairly displeased that they don't get to interact with many more locals, and that it's basically just like attending a uni in their own country (although this is anecdotal). 

The university basically relies on the fact that no locals will enter this course and see what's really going on - and the few that attempt it may be driven away due to the high concentrations of non-locals simly due to the fact that you will have nobody to talk to or do proper work with.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 65-70% + 15-20%? Lucky. I'm about 1 in 240 at my course at Monash. It's basically assumed that everyone in the course is Chinese, and people generally assume that you can speak it too (I couldn't really look further different). Of course there's a few others mixed in, a few Malaysian and a tiny percentage Singaporean, but I'd put it at around 80% Chinese. It doesn't bother me one bit where they come from but it's rather difficult to deal with when they can't communicate and you're thrown in with them for 30%-weighted assignments. There's no doubt that a significant amount would fail English at a high school level, in fact I wouldn't be surprised if some were at, or below a primary school level. To them, as long as their IELTS score is above some threshold, they're perfectly good at English. There's a few that honestly do try though, and they all tend to flock around me since I'm apparently their personal English tutor now. That said, at least they're trying, unlike most. 

I've come across some that couldn't put a single coherent sentence together - but I managed to kick one out of my group and I honestly hope they fail him considering how horrible his language skills were. What's more pathetic however is the English level of the people working internally. I received this 'feedback' a little while ago. 

"Excellent work indeed. The student shows that he has the very strong command in using accounting and economics information to conduct the financial analysis in the fundamental level. The work is written in a very professional manner and well presented. The student also demonstrate that he put lots of efforts in predicting the firms' future performance on his own."

Wonder how many times Google Translate was used here. Just like all the work submitted to them. 

I suppose this is what happens when the unis get a tad greedy. The internationals are paying some 4.4k per subject as opposed to 1.3k for the locals so it's rather obvious what's driving it. 

Oh and by the way, this isn't even at an under-grad level... this is Masters.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Hotel/Motel recommendation in the Baulkham Hills area? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-26 14:59:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey r/sydney, I'll be travelling from Melbourne by car for an Assessment Centre in the Baulkham Hills area on Wednesday morning. I've been looking for a place to stay in the nearby region but only see a few options, and I'm really trying to avoid paying over $200 for one night. I'm not overly fussed about the quality, but will need a good night's rest since it's a very late notice interview that I'm only just now preparing for.

The "Ibis budget Wentworthville" is the only apparent option in this scenario. Is there anywhere anyone can recommend otherwise? I'm willing to stay in the 10km region of the suburb. Cheers!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've bought and sold quite a few things on it, and I've never had any issues simply due to my attitude towards it. You will get a lot of messages with ridiculous low-balling (like 25% of the price), and a lot telling you their life stories and why you should give it to them for free or something. It's as simple as saying a big no to them. I usually put my price up a tiny bit to let people negotiate (as just about everyone has done), but if it sells at my asking price, so be it. Like others have said, I'm one of those people that will not hold an item. If you want it, make some time and come to get it, unless you're willing to put down a deposit. 

The next reason may be that your ads simply aren't descriptive enough. Most ads I see are extremely vague and don't say too much, so of course I will ask if it's "still available" simply because I don't trust the seller enough to actually remove an item since they can't even be bothered typing an ad. 

It's this sort of shit that drives me insane and will leave people hanging dry.

<TEXT> That's a really neat looking GTO, love the styling on the older ones with the pop up lights over the later ones. The out of alignment fogs are bugging me though haha!

I had something *similar* happen to me but on a much lesser scale, as a kid I always loved playing GT and in 2005, GT4 was released, and eventually I was almost only driving Subaru Legacys in game for some weird reason. I was 11 years old at the time but I always had a major soft spot for them. In fact I spent many hours on the then-major-feature, Photomode, taking photos of them. I still have a few thankfully.

In 2012 when I was looking to buy my first car, after looking at quite a few other cars, I ended up having a black Gen 4 by near chance. I really forgot about having one on GT that I had driven for thousands of kilometers too. Although it's definitely not a GT-B (I wish), it's weird how I ended up with a super similar car as to what I had on GT so many years ago.

<TEXT> Prices depend greatly on what size tyres you need, not to mention brand or model. Post up what exactly you want and maybe someone can help better. Usually, a lot of tyre brands have 4 for 3 deals or cash back offers which are both of decent value. Here's some random examples of places to look up prices:

<TEXT> I just think for the time ('09) that it was a tad outdated, especially being a 4spd. When it was introduced in '03 with the shift mode (I think?) I'm sure it wouldn't have been bad at all. I actually think it's pretty decent for going quick in, feels nicer the quicker you go, but at low speed it's very meh IMO. No doubt it's reliable though, in that sense yes, it is definitely a good transmisison.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I find the SPORT mode completely useless. If I want to go quick I'll do it myself, thank you. The sequential is good, I find myself shifting much more intuitively and smoother than what the car can manage anyway. If you're feeling really game you can kind blip the throttle (since the gear change is so slow lol) while downshifting and make it a whole lot smoother, but this is of course completely useless, just dumb fun. One problem though; the gear stick shifts the wrong way. Drives me insane! There's a reason mine's a manual.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have nearly exactly the same car but a model year earlier (I think equivalent to US model though). The main problem I'd look out for is headgaskets and oil leaks (specifically into where the sparks sit). It would be hard to check, and many mechanics won't be able to tell if there's anything wrong without opening it up or at least checking the sparks. The issues seem to be very common and most of the cars only ever suffer from the same problems, I've never heard of other major issues with them. 

Just FYI the 4EAT is pretty horrible for day to day use (IMO). The only way I drive it is using the 'sequential'. That said, it works decently well in the twisties even though it may not seem like it.

<TEXT> Oh, that's the same size tyre I'm running as well. My fronts are pretty much perfectly flush with the fenders but my rears are still a little further in due to natural camber. Feels as if the car has wider front track than rear. I think yours has even more offset by the looks of it. Yours looks super nice and chunky. How do you find the handling? It made my steering vague (as expected) but I feel as if cornering speeds have greatly improved.

<TEXT> I go with whatever feels right. I have Michelin PS3s, and the tyre shop filled them to 40psi. After doing quite a bit of spirited, city, and highway driving, I've found that I can go down to about 34psi for spirited which "appears" to help cornering, and up to around 39 for highway. I've done absolutely 0 quantitative tests and I'm only going by feel, but I can feel some difference from low (31) to high (40), only in hard cornering. I am simply assuming higher is better for milage so I pump them up for longer trips.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It came out pretty nice for the small amount of money, it doesn't remove the deep scratches or etchings but does work well on swirls and random patches. I wasn't expecting much at all but I'm impressed that it did anything, it's good for little isolated parts of panels, but it would take absolutely ages to do any significant part of the car (by hand, that is). I applied it with a small foam application pad. It takes a lot of effort to rub the product in and it sucks doing it in the heat (as expected with hand application).

Depends on what you want to get done, $350 probably won't be enough for a properly done polish. The only way you'll probably find this is if you go to one of those generic "detail" shops which probably won't do a very good job. As someone commented before, try Obsession Detailing, he knows his stuff very well and charges very reasonable prices. If you just want a wash + wax/seal + basic interior clean you can probably find it for a lot less.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can use most GPS devices (a phone would do) to find out a more accurate speed. It isn't perfect but it's usually quite close, it won't update quickly enough to properly estimate speed during acceleration but will be fine once you're up to a more constant speed. I find mine spot on when checking with those overhead readout things.  </TEXT>

I've recently sold a few things within the range of $100 and bought something for nearly 1k and every person I've come across has been genuine and fine to deal with. That said, I detail my ads as much as possible so the buyer knows exactly what to expect, plus I include heaps of photos and try to reply ASAP. The same cannot be said for the ads I am interested in. It's usually easy enough to tell if someones genuine simply by their manner of communicating. Use common sense and you will be fine.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This makes me wonder why content keeps coming yet the game performance keeps dropping. I've always had this theory that some of the "DLC" is just either unfinished or previously finished things that they've had lying around that they keep releasing to make people think they're still working on the game. I.e. they only ever released 75% of the game but they've always had some 90~ complete.  </TEXT>

You're right I think. So unfortunate that they chose this route. I would even go as far as arguing that the game performance hit may have been chosen as a method to stop the cheating online, but they didn't realise how much of a performance hit there would be. Of course this is just speculation, but knowing R* I wouldn't be surprised.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As much as I agree with R* is dedicated to their game, their actions seem like sometimes they're very clumsy making it seem otherwise. Considering the changes they have made up to date, it looks like they are continuously adding more content but ignoring support for the foundations of the game itself (eg. matchmaking, performance issues, game launch issues). What it indicates (in my opinion) is that while they do care, they just seem to be bandaging all the issues and expecting their code to be a workaround rather than finding the source of the issues and fixing that instead. 

It almost feels like R* is a few different companies all working in different directions, and that they are not focussed in fixing the game but rather adding content and expecting people to be satisfied with it. After all, the game only broke after adding new content, it was otherwise fine. I wonder how this will all work in the long term, especially when R* decides to end support for the game. On top of this, what does this imply about the long term playability of online? Will the game keep breaking as more updates are released?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Regarding the current state of GTA's PC performance:  Is it realistic to ever expect the game to run as intended?** 

As many of you may be aware, the latest IGG patches have demolished some player's PC performances. Personally I have experienced the PS3 version of the game running very poorly too, to a point where simply driving a car at full speed will make the game not render any objects or the map itself. In the long term with new content being constantly added, will there ever be a point in time where the game will run smoothly on all platforms? It seems like it isn't in R*'s interest as they have already received money for the game. Have there been any other games that have had similar issues? How have they been handled?  </TEXT>

I mean I understand (to some extent) if the game was broken at launch, then fixed, but to be broken, then fixed, then broken again? Not to mention how easy it is to completely break someones game by pressing a few buttons on a script?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Cooler Master CM Storm Trigger Mechanical Keyboard with Cherry MX Black Switches </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-01 11:07:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **SOLD**

I've got a used **Cooler Master CM Storm Trigger** Mechanical Keyboard for sale with **Cherry MX Black** switches. It has switchable red backlit keys which can be toggled into different modes.

The keyboard itself has **some wear marks** from general usage and will **only come with the original gold-plated Mini-USB cable**. I do not have the original boxes or documentation, the extended wrist-rest, or any charging adaptor for the on-board USB hub (as far as I know, this part is not included when new either and only enables charging). 

http://imgur.com/a/YRJOC

Looking for **$60 negotiable**. I am open to offers and maybe swaps. I don't mind swapping for another part but would obviously prefer cash. Swaps at my discretion only, and I am most interested in any low-end LGA1156 CPU with cash adjustment if you do happen to have one. 

Pick up in 3165 or willing to bring to you within reasonable distances. Not willing to post. Please PM me here if interested! 

You can find more about the keyboard here:

<TEXT> After the update, none of my game settings will be updated from what they were previously. They'll be changed for the duration of time that the game will be open but as soon as the game is re-launched, everything returns to the original values. It seems to be happening to any option I change and means I have to manually reset the options each time I play and it's getting damn annoying. On top of this, every time I start online I have to agree the EULA. I haven't really heard of anyone else having this issue and it's super annoying considering the game crashes all the time too. Any possible solutions? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I reboot a lot too, thankfully my SSD means I can boot into game very quickly if not I'd be sitting here wasting more time launching than playing. But yeah it seems to be a similar problem, although after I reboot, about half the time I'd get stuck on the pause menu spinning symbol or the phone won't work. I doubt this has anything to do with hardware.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've tried both OVERclocking and UNDERclocking the GPU but it seems to make 0 difference to crashes OR performance towards the game... That said, the game runs quite well other than the times it doesn't want to work at all lol. That said, I've only tried underclocking it minimally so maybe I'll give that another shot but at a more extreme underclock.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Constantly crashing during heists </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-22 17:08:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My game is constantly crashing during heists and setups. It sometimes happens in exactly the same spots but other time just seems to fail randomly. I have only crashed once during free roam (started today) and never crashed during a normal mission (non heist). What usually happens is the game will simply freeze for a moment, then the screen will go completely white and the normal Windows "Program has stopped working" screen is showen. Alternatively, the pause menu will be endlessly showing the spinning symbol and phone will not pop up. Sometimes I can play for hours on end without a single crash and other times I can't be in a game for more than a minute. Albeit rarely, sometimes the game will cause a BSOD as well. 

I'm running the retail DVD edition of the game (on the latest patch) and on the latest 2.4.1.21 Nvidia drivers too. The crashes have been happening since day 1 and no driver or patch has stopped the crashes. 

My PC specs are as follows: 





Part | Model
---|---
CPU | i7 870
Mobo | Gigabyte P55A-UD3-DS3L
RAM | Corsair XMS3 (4x2GB) CMX4GX3M2A1600C9
GPU | Gainward Nvidia GTX 960 
SSD | Transcend SSD370 256GB 
OS | W7 Home Premium 64bit
PSU | Antec EarthWatts 750W



If it makes a difference, I play with my PS3 controller too. 

Is there anyone else experiencing such crashes? It's really damn frustrating and makes me look like an ass when I keep leaving games after a minute.  </TEXT>

On top of this, the file will not be accurate at all since I used 21 different instruments to make this. I just wanted to make it sound accurate so I used random instruments to replicate it. So, maybe I will answer with "soon". :)  </TEXT>

I recently had someone who helped me up to this point, but something happened and I can't really talk to them any more. It really hurts not having them around to keep me company any more, but I have to move on. I am so happy that you found someone to talk to, I know how much it helps.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm experiencing absolutely awful keyboard lag after the recent update. I find it difficult to type anything and the actual typed text takes what seems like an eternity to actually show up on screen. The vibration while typing is also delayed, and the auto correct seems to be almost non existent too. Getting a word wrong is like death and means that half the message will get deleted even though I would just tap the backspace. The phone is otherwise ok, and I'm not experiencing any other issues, such as battery problems that appear to be common. The phone was also fine before the update, it's just the keyboard that is awful. Is there any way to fix this without reverting to factory?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're right, the site shouldn't stray far from it's core purpose as that's why it is (relatively) popular. I'm still assuming that the more 'casual' users populate the majority. 

What about a default 'lite' UI with the current features (or maybe even less?) and an 'advanced' UI option with a more complicated set of features (that is assuming that you do actually intend on adding 'more' instead of enhancing what is there currently). I'm not really sure of the implications of this but just some food for thought I suppose. Just depends on your vision for the site.  </TEXT>

1. An ability to lock the window onto any part of the song. It is rather annoying when working on the very end of a very long piece and having the window attempt to scroll back to the start. Having the window auto-scroll with the play bar also takes a toll on the playback speed. 

2. Ability to select only certain instruments. The current selection tool is simple and easy to use and I think should remain, but it would be nice if it allowed you to select only instruments of your choice. In conjunction with this, a way to replace these selected instruments with others. 

3. In addition to the copy/paste function, a clipboard to store maybe the last few things you copied. The current copy/paste method relies on dragging and dropping, and does not work correctly when moving large sections of a piece. It could be placed in the free space in the side bar [here with the same layout as the links above.](http://i.gyazo.com/7d8652f7c9f04753964c2e62cacd124f.png)

4. Viewable statistics of a sequence. Eg. amount of notes, time length. Not really necessary but would be neat.

<TEXT> Firstly, I'm glad to see you and PD starting to go a little more public and open up to the community. 

As a long term, avid player of the GT series, I have noticed that there have been reiterative new additions of features to each of the games such as B-Spec mode, course creators and photomode. Are you currently looking into more innovative content such as this to add to GT6/7? (eg. a drag racing mode)

Do you ever think car customisation will become more prevalent in future GT games? I felt that GT has been going somewhat backwards in terms of cars themselves but forward in terms of driving. I personally loved the racing modifications on GT2 and loved turning family sedans into race cars. On top of visual modifications, performance modifications also seem to have been more packaged together unlike in older GT games. I feel as if this has taken away some of the immersion of the older games where you started poor and built up your cars using cheap parts along the career mode. Is there a possibility in future GT games that this will return? Or is the playerbase generally looking for a quicker way to modify their cars? 

GT appears to be heading towards actual racing with race-prepped cars and moving away from more 'normal' road cars. Is the game heading towards an emphasis of actual racing cars and less towards road cars? 

Are there any plans on bringing back shuffle racing (such as in GT5) to GT6/7? I know for a fact that this is something the community misses. 

Do you and/or PD actively listen to communities and fanbases such as GTPlanet for inspiration or do 

you have a-set-in-stone vision for future updates and general advancement of the series? 

And one personally, what is your favourite car and track combo on GT6? 

Finally, thank you for creating GT. It really helped ignite my love of cars and is collectively my most played game series.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 4.4k is ridiculous money to spend on a 2.5 N/A Gen 3 IMHO. Back when I was searching for a Gen 3, I could've picked one up in reasonable condition for about 5k (manual) with around 200ks on the clock. At that kind of cost, I would probably just find a new engine with less usage on it and drop that in.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I personally don't find rev-matching impossible with the 2.5i, infact I do it very frequently and it makes driving a lot smoother in general, whether or not I'm driving quickly. Heel-toeing isn't any more difficult but of course, I don't do this very often compared to simple rev-matching. I haven't driven an older car quickly before but since I'm used to driving "newer" cars, I absolutely don't find it that difficult at all. That said, DBW sucks and it makes the car feel sluggish and makes you have less confidence when driving, but I've heard a good tune can solve that. 

Speaking of which, I recently drove a 2011 WRX and for once, I really felt glad getting back into my much slower car, since it felt a lot nicer to drive in my opinion. The WRX felt 'too big' to me, but I guess that's just because again, I'm used to an older car that like you have stated, feels much more "fun" to drive. No doubt the WRX isn't quick though, brilliant car for what its meant to be.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> On top of this, if the instructor says to do something that is inherently unsafe, don't do it. On my test, the instructor, at the last moment on a busy 2 lane divided road, told me to turn left at the next lights while I was in the right lane and about 100m away from the lights. Didn't help that there was already a truck right next to me at the time. I simply said that I thought it was unsafe to do so, and didn't lose any marks at all.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I honestly don't think you can properly 'learn to drive' with just 50 hours (as you say). However, you probably can pass a test with a lot less since it's way too easy, and if you're doing it in an auto, and can't pass, then of course, I don't think you deserve a licence at all. If you just want a licence, I'm sure you can get away with 50, but I really wouldn't advise this at all. I had to do my 120 hours, but I ended up completing them in just over a month and must've clocked up around 1000 at least before I sat my test. I still learn things on the road every time I drive on my Ps, so just doing 50 hours is definitely not the end of learning. 

Maybe what you should do is, simply learn to pass your test (which is easy), then get your Ps, and *then* learn to drive on your own. 

$40 an hour certainly doesn't sound too bad, an instructor I used charged $60 an hour and this seems to be the standard rate in my area for all instructors. 

Surely there are a few deserted or mostly unused back streets in your area? How about an unused carpark? I don't think you necessarily need a paddock or a field. Do you need a fully licensed driver if you're in a completely deserted carpark in the middle of nowhere? 

I find it extremely unfortunate that for those of you that actually follow the rules (such as OP) and want to learn to actually drive struggle to find someone to take them driving. A lot of people I know just faked their hours and are now driving on the roads, which *sucks*.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Someone on a Subaru forum thinks it could be the heat shield would explain the noise while just revving it, but there's also a very loud screech/grinding noise (my dad heard it while driving the other Lib with the windows all up) when I launch hard in first (which can kind of be felt through the clutch pedal), especially on a hill where you need to up the revs for a quick start. The clutch feels fine but there's a squeak too at low speed, and I'm assuming it's on it's original clutch, so it's safe to assume it still has the dual-mass setup. Mechanic took it for a drive and said he'd never heard this noise before from any car too. Could it be related?

<TEXT> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY_LQVhTDmk

My newly purchased 2.5i Liberty (EJ253 SOHC) manual is making a kind of grinding/rattling sound. I compared it to my other car (an 08' 2.5i) and it simply doesn't have a sound like this. It happens mostly when the revs drop hard, coming from the engine bay. You can slightly hear it in the video but it's a little louder in reality since my phone's mic isn't that good. I launched at the lights reasonably hard yesterday and the noise was quite loud too. Any ideas?

<TEXT> You can't get more power from it (that's very noticeable anyway) unless you go with forced induction, where supercharging is somewhat getting popular over here in Aus. It's a fairly long process and costs a lot. You'd be better off selling and getting a car that's already turbocharged from the factory.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a Liberty 2.5i 08' 4EAT (Yeah the auto sucks) as my first proper car. As much as I initially regret not purchasing a 6 cyl model, the 2.5 is plentiful for a new driver. Sometimes you just need to rev it a little harder to get it going but it's also kind of fun doing that too. The only main let down is the 4EAT which absolutely sucks in normal auto, so I only ever drive in sequential (what's worse is that I have a manual licence).

Just get an N/A Subaru, there's really nothing wrong with the power/torque for a new driver. I imagined the car to be underpowered but it's certainly got enough to have some fun with. Plus, it's the handling of the Lib that impresses me, just stay away from the autos unless they have some sort of manual shiftability.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've found that most rF mods are terrible physics-wise (at least from my perspective). If you want good physics without a hassle, I wouldn't recommend rF as you're going to have to try a lot of mods until you find something you like. There's only a few mods I personally drive without editing myself, being WSC70, HistorX, DRM and FIA GT3 2010. 

However, rF is a fantastic base game to mod with, and it's really a sandbox once you know what you're doing. I usually just use other people's converted models (mostly road cars) and re-do the physics myself to my own liking until I make something I enjoy. Rinse, and repeat.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was in an ALP type thing too but only for maths (the school only had that). If you got in (or anyone else for that matter), you'll probably be just fine with the rest of the group who also enter Mac Rob. I would say to just do it, it'll provide you with a lot of different experiences and you don't need to lose contact with your old friends. It might help if you have starting ground in the form of other friends entering from your school too however, if not, it may seem a little daunting at first. Within the first week, you'll be completely fine.  </TEXT>

If you are seriously contemplating staying, accept the Mac Rob offer, then negotiate with your current school that you will stay with benefits. The school will not want to lose you as you will push their results up. I'm fairly sure you can decline the Mac Rob offer quite easily as there are people waiting to get in. Did you get in to a Yr. 10 or 11 entry or into Yr. 9? </TEXT>
