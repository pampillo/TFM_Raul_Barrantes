<TEXT> Things will get better! Healing isn't linear; there will be moments when it feels fresh and raw all over again, but as time goes on those will happen less and less, and eventually you'll look back and realize it's been months since you last cried. I actually have a tag on tumblr for posts/quotes that make me feel better, if you want I can pm you the link. I'd like to share one of my favourite quotes that helped me through some things, as well.
Your body is not a temple. Temples can be destroyed and desecrated. Your body is a forest, thick canopies of maple trees and sweet scented wild flowers sprouting in the underwood. You will grow back, over and over again, no matter how badly you are devastated.

You got this. If you ever need to chat, I'm just a PM away. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is absolutely, 100% possible to get over your first love. The first few sentences of your post could have been written by me. I'm 20 and was also in a relationship from age 17 that ended last summer. In my case, he treated me horribly toward the end (and during), and that was what I tried to remember. Any time I missed him I would mentally go over the list of things that were bad about him. Are there any things your ex did that hurt you, any negative qualities that he had? It's sort of like when somebody dies, you get love goggles and you only remember the good things about them.

It also sounds like your depression isn't being managed very well. What's your support system like? If you don't feel like your meds are working the way that they should be, it might be worth a quick visit to your doctor. It took me a long time to find the right "cocktail" for me, but once I did, things became a lot easier. Having depression is like being stuck at the bottom of a deep hole, but the right medication could be a ladder for you. You still have to do the work and climb your way out of the hole, but you have that base there that makes it just a little bit easier. 

For me, the biggest key to getting over a relationship is distract, distract distract. Remembering that nice Christmas you had together? Oh look, here's a tutorial on how to build a homemade kite. See something that reminds you of him? Here's an article about something you're interested in. I'm not sure if you can make kites at home actually, so maybe don't try that. Even if you don't feel like doing anything, you could watch something interesting on your phone or download a new game to try out. I'm sure if you googled around you could find billions of things to occupy your time. I can also recommend a really awesome breakup playlist.

This has gotten way too long but I feel like I'm talking to my past self. I am much happier now, but it was SUCH a long road to get here. But it is absolutely worth it. My wish for you is that in 5 years you look back on this and remind yourself that you can get through *anything* that comes your way. I'm rooting for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think I know which comment you're referring to and I apologize for the poor wording. What I meant was, on the first day of them working for me, I showed them around the apartment and told them which rooms/areas I wanted clean. For the last 3 months, they've just cleaned those same areas, which are basically everything but my office. What I think (hope) happened was they saw my cluttered office and thought that they would tidy up in there. But they threw out my very important notebook so I can't say that for sure.

I'm going to be talking with them soon about this, and if their explanation is something normal, which I'm sure it will be, I'll just make it clear to please not touch my office under any circumstances unless my cat is on fire and rolling around on my desk. My initial reaction was to fire them because I was so mad, but they are *really* good at their jobs normally and they are family friends so I don't want to make things uncomfortable. Also, the part about actually cleaning things rather than just wetting the surface made me laugh so hard. That is too real. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The apartment doesn't get super messy because there are two people living there and one is a broke student. Ramen noodle packages and tears don't create a lot of garbage. Plus I am in school full time and work on top of that - I'm barely home to make a mess. The only things the cleaning ladies have to do are the floors and dusting plus the kitchen appliances etc.

when I lived in an apartment I cleaned every day for hours

??? I feel like this is either hyperbolic or you have 14 children.

<TEXT> A few people have suggested it and I totally understand the thought but knowing my parents, there is absolutely no way they could have done this. My mom is the one that knows Karena and Amanda so she would have set it up. Having my house cleaned without my knowledge is maybe something that she would do - but it's unlikely, and at the *very least* she would consult my boyfriend on it - it's his house too. 

Even if that were the case, my mom is the most selfless woman I have ever met. I just got off the phone with her about an hour ago and I explained in detail what was changed (something I didn't do earlier) and she was completely shocked and is now more upset than I am about this. If she had had anything at all to do with it, she absolutely would have owned up to it. My mom is my best friend in the world and I trust her with everything. I know that she didn't do this.

<TEXT> This is exactly how I feel. To me, it's like the equivalent of having a babysitter that comes to watch my children every day, and then one day I come home to find out that they took the dog to the groomer. Yes, it was a semi-helpful thing to do, but it was done incorrectly and *without my permission*. That's really the biggest thing here.

I can't imagine my parents having anything to do with this. We have a really good relationship and they're very much sane people. I think the reason they aren't as upset as I am is because when I was a teenager, my bedroom was a DISASTER so they probably figure that my office was the same and all Karena and Amanda did was tidy things up for me. I didn't mention how they threw out my notes for school but I think once I do they'll be a lot more angry. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was about 7 years old, my brother convinced me to lock him in the trunk of my dad's car to see if he could get out (he had seen it in a movie). I did so and after a few minutes, he banged on the door and I opened it for him. I wanted to try, but he said no.

A couple days later, my dad came home from work and I stole his keys and locked myself in the trunk. I figured I was way smarter than my brother, and even if I wasn't there would be a little handle for me to pull and the trunk would open like my mom's car. Little did I know, my dad's car was older and there was no such handle. It was the middle of summer and I was in long pants and a sweater; I felt like I was in an oven. I remember kicking the door and screaming to no avail. Our neighbour just happened to be running a skill saw at the same time, so nobody could hear me screaming, even if they wanted to. I just remember thinking that I was so dumb and I couldn't believe I was going to die never having stood up to the bully in my class. Weird but that's where my 7 year old brain went.

After about 15 minutes my parents came looking for me and somehow heard me screaming from the trunk. When they opened it, I was *completely* drenched in sweat and sitting in a puddle of it as well. Now I never climb into the trunks of cars unless I know for sure that they have a release handle. </TEXT>

<TEXT> People don't change until they're uncomfortable enough. He is *very* comfortable. He doesn't have to do anything at all because if he neglects it long enough, he knows you'll be there to pick up the slack. The problem is, you can't exactly ignore your crying child until he finally pays some attention to her.

Is there any way you could leave? If it's possible, find someone to stay with and meet somewhere neutral and explain to him that things need to change if you're going to stay married. This is not acceptable. 

A couple people have suggested that his medication is not working properly and he is experiencing a depressive episode. I have depression myself and work in the mental health sector, and this part stood out to me:
He'll study obscure German air force history from ww2 for hours, but won't read a short article on parenting. 

I don't know about you, but I haven't met many depressed people that are able to focus and remain engaged and interested for longer than 15 minutes, let alone hours. Even if it's something that he doesn't care about, there is no way he is so incredibly depressed that he just can't read a short parenting article. I don't know your husband personally, so I could be speaking out of turn, but it sounds like his lack of parenting stems from deadbeatdaditis, not depression.

You've mentioned that you feel like a single parent, and the reason why is because you are. That's not okay. Your husband helped bring this child into the world and now it's his responsibility to nurture and care for her until she is capable of being on her own. No ifs, ands, or buts. You don't get to just change your mind about being a dad, and what makes it worse is the baby was planned. The level of respect you deserve and that of which you're receiving are two vastly different things.

I empathize with you and I truly hope that both you and your daughter have a really great life, whether you decide to leave your husband or work on things.  </TEXT>

I haven't been there in about 10 years so it was so nice to see everything from my childhood and my old house (not how I remembered it? I thought it was yellow but it's apparently peach. I think they painted it and everyone is lying). It made me feel really close to him to show him the places I used to play soccer when I was 6 years old.

A little excerpt:
"No matter what form they may take, they still love each other. Though not bound together by earthly laws or morality, though they never once clasped hands, each possessed the other completely. Nothing could part them. Centuries to come, if one white cloud trails another, two blades of grass grow side by side, one wave splashes another, a breeze follows another... believe me, that will be them." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are you sure that this person that you're dating is a fully grown adult woman and not a 14 year old girl? 
My GF and I where painting and sipping and I was particularly into my piece of art - I was really trying to make it good! Half way through my GF saw my picture and said "It's excellent! it's even better than mine" and then she drew a thick black painted happy face on my canvas. 

I've gone to a few paint and wine nights with my boyfriend. I have the talent of a blind 6 year old while he's able to construct masterpieces by flicking paint over his shoulder. I cannot ever imagine a time or place where I would have the audacity to wreck something that he put SO much time and effort into. Your girlfriend does not respect you, nor does she care about your happiness. Do you really want to be with somebody like that?

Your issue here isn't that your girlfriend has 'mood swings'. Your issue is that your girlfriend is *mean*.

<TEXT> The only thing I would say is a concern is potentially the Neutrogena sunscreen? A few of their sunscreens have methylisothiazolinone in it, which is a preservative recommended only for rinse-off products. You'd have to check the ingredients of the type you have, though. My go-to sunscreen is either the Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence or Dr. Dennis Gross Sheer Mineral Sun Spray. 

Also, Drunk Elephant's products are the best. Their vitamin c serum is killer and I just got their TLC Framboos serum a few weeks ago and my skin has such a beautiful natural glow to it; I've stopped wearing foundation.

What type of maracuja oil are you using? I haven't done enough research on the Tarte one but I've heard a couple people say they just buy passiflora edulis seed oil from the local health food store since it's a third of the price of Tarte's version for the exact same thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been working in a high end women's clothing store for almost a year now. I started as a general sales associate but I was promoted to the head of the lingerie department about 6 months ago. I have had several other jobs and I've always gotten along well with my coworkers and supervisors so I don't think that my personality factors in.

My boss has been there for about 2 years. During the interview process, we talked for about 15 minutes and then she hired me on the spot, which she told me she's never done before. The first shift that I had, though, her demeanor totally changed. She was short with me and rolled her eyes every time I had a question. Her take on 'training' is basically to throw the employee in the middle of the action and they'll have to figure it out themselves.

The turnover rate for my store is absolutely abysmal; the average length that we employ someone is 5 months. Aside from my boss, I've been here the longest.

Onto the pressing issue, I recently got sick but since my boss dislikes when people call in sick, I stuck it out for a couple shifts and just relied on tea and Buckleys. Last Saturday, though, I was puking uncontrollably so I called in sick and went to the doctor. He gave me some medication for the nausea and told me to stay on bed rest. I turned my sick note in the next shift I had.

Since it's December I've been working a LOT of hours despite being part time (I'm a full time student). I was scheduled to work approx 35 hours a week for the rest of December which was going to be really hard to handle on top of school, but I was managing quite well. 

Skip to this morning, I opened the store and went to double check the schedule to see who else I worked with, and almost all of my shifts have been crossed out. I am now working 4 hours a week for the rest of December. My parents pay my rent so I don't have to worry about housing or anything, but I'm still annoyed and confused.

My coworkers are as mad as I am and have said they would back me up if I contact HR, but at this point I kind of just want to quit. I was offered a job a couple of weeks ago that pays almost twice what I make here, but I'm really good at my current job and I get excited to go to work. 

This isn't the first instance of my boss screwing her employees over. She has a long history of slacking and spending her entire shift on her phone in the staff room, as well as leaving 4 hours early and telling me to clock her out when her shift is supposed to end. She also manipulates our sales target program and changes other peoples' names to hers so that she looks good in front of her bosses.

I have my letter of resignation typed up and ready to go but I'm on the fence about turning it in. I do really love my job but our HR department has proven ineffective in the past. My boyfriend thinks that I should just quit and report her and hope that they do something, but I feel like that's just the easy way out. Is it?

TL;DR - My boss cut my hours from 35/week to 4/week after I called in sick, despite having a doctor's note. My coworkers and friends think I should report her to HR and see if anything is done, but at this point I kind of just want to be done. Is quitting just the easy way out? </TEXT>

When we got home, my mom asked me where I got the gum from, and I lied and told her that I got it from her friend. Her friend had dentures so obviously she wasn't chewing gum. My mom asked me again and I told her that I found it under the table, cue me being forced to brush my teeth for half an hour. Good times. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You should tell him. Being open and honest is key when dating a mentally ill person. Wait until you're feeling calm and relaxed, and explain your situation to him. I don't know the specifics of your mental illnesses, but I have depression, anxiety and OCD and sometimes I need my partner to be a little bit more patient with me than with a neurotypical partner. He can't understand some aspects of your life if you don't tell him why you do these things. If you need to be by yourself for a little because you're feeling depressed, it's way easier for you to be honest and say that you're having a bad depression day than it is for you to just say you don't want to talk to anybody. Good luck, OP. I hope that things work out between you two. </TEXT>

<TEXT> She cheated on you, and then said she wanted radio silence for two weeks. If she wanted to be with you, she would be working on the relationship and trying to fix what she broke by kissing another boy. It's time to move on, OP. I'm sorry. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going through this same thing right now and you have to remember that if she was the perfect person for you, things would've worked out and you'd still be together. You ended the relationship for a reason. She was your first love, but your first love doesn't mean your only love. As for feeling like she's the only girl in the world, the breakup is still very fresh in your mind and it's normal to feel regret and that there's never going to be another person for you. You need to give yourself time to heal before you start thinking about somebody new. It's not going to happen overnight, but it will happen. I promise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Once you lose someone, it's never exactly the same person that comes back. It sounds like you're just experiencing the normal anxiety that comes after a breakup, but you have to remember that you ended things for a reason. If you do decide to get back together, know that it's not going to be the same relationship you once had. A re-lit cigarette never tastes the same. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The doctor would be able to tell her if she had a tilted uterus, and it wouldn't completely obscure the baby, it would just be more difficult to see. It's not like the baby is hiding in the corner of her uterus holding up a piece of tin foil so that the ultrasound waves don't detect it. If she has her period, she's not pregnant. It really just sounds like she wants attention. My advice is to get out ASAP. Her need for attention is only going to escalate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He's cheated on you twice and you're still with him? Why, exactly? It doesn't sound like this guy really cares about you enough to put effort into the relationship. He only stopped talking to the second girl because she didn't feel the same way, not because he knew it was wrong. He has depression but makes little attempt to manage it. This guy sounds like a loser, to be quite honest. You need to find somebody that is emotionally mature enough to commit to you, completely. And not cheat on you, even if it's just emotionally. Fool me once... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have you brought these feelings up to your therapist? I would also let your boyfriend know how you're feeling, if you haven't already. I struggle with anxiety as well, and self talk helps me. You need to remind yourself that he's with you for a reason; if he didn't love you and find you sexually fulfilling, it's likely he wouldn't be with you. You were also in a bad relationship previous to this, and that seems to have impacted your self esteem. Again, I would bring this up to your therapist. I hope things work out!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You've been broken up for longer than you were together, it's time to move on. This girl said she didn't want a relationship, so you need to accept that and find somebody that does. You're going to be in college soon, and what if she ends up going somewhere else? Or, if you stay together throughout college, who says you're even going to be compatible? College is a huge growing period, a year from now I doubt you'll recognize the person you are right now. You need to keep busy and focus on school and your friends and stop thinking about this girl.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know that you mentioned you don't want to see a therapist or talk to a stranger but you really, really need to. Your girlfriend also sounds like a really awful person and I'm sorry that you have to deal with this pain. You can't make homes out of people, and you did that with her. It's important in a relationship to have your own life, your own interests and own things going on so that if it ends you still have all these other things going for you that aren't tied to that person. I really suggest that you try to speak to somebody about your past, even if it's just an online advice website, kind of like a suicide hotline but chat style. Please don't kill yourself over this, you're going to find somebody that will accept your past and love you entirely, and your girlfriend just wasn't that person. You need to work on yourself and become stable and accept the things that happened to you, and deal with those feelings, before you involve another person. Good luck, OP. You can always PM me if you want to talk. You're going to get through this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He sounds like a creep. You dodged a bullet, breaking up with him. I think you need to go as no contact as you can - block his number, call a cab if your car breaks down. Try to expand your social circle and find people that don't know him, and stick near them during parties he's at, or don't go to any parties for a while. I would also try getting in contact with a counselor at your university and explain to them that this guy has been harassing you, maybe something can be done by them, or they can get campus security involved as well. Good luck, I hope you find a way to ditch this loser! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes! They sniff each other's faces too, actually. Sometimes it's kind of hard to tell if they're playing or fighting, but in the past couple days whenever they're 'fighting', their ears have been perked up and there wasn't any growling or anything, so I think they're just playing and learning to be friends. Good luck with your new cat! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Old cat hates new cat - what can I do? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> TL;DR: My newest cat (2 y/o Daisy, female) and my oldest cat (11y/o Max, male) have been growling and hissing at each other ever since I adopted Daisy. I don't know how to make them like each other, or at least tolerate each other. 

Hi, all! I recently (as in two days ago) adopted a beautiful 2 year old domestic short haired grey cat, Daisy. She was a little apprehensive on the first day, but I set up a cat lounge in my bedroom complete with her food/water, litter box, hiding places, and toys and she seems to be adjusting to her new life pretty well. She sleeps in my room with me at night and is very snuggly. 

Daisy wasn't put in a cage with other cats while she was in the shelter as she had a respiratory infection and some other (resolved) illnesses that the volunteers didn't want spreading to the other animals. She is completely healed now, but as far as I know she hasn't had contact with other cats. 

My problem is, I have an 11 year old long haired ginger male named Max, and they do not get along. Max is the most kind and tolerant cat I've ever met; he's been around dogs and cats alike and has never had an issue with them, aside from some hissing if dogs are too close. He's very gentle, and never seems aggressive with other animals, more so scared. 

I tried to follow the internet's advice and introduce them gradually, but my parents ruined this by letting them into the same room the first day Daisy was home while I was busy doing something. Daisy growled a little, and they hissed at each other, and then I found out and put her back in my room. Since then, I've let them hang out for 10-15 minutes until one hisses and then I take her back to her cat lounge.

Max hasn't been eating, and he is a very food oriented cat. He even seems disinterested in treats, and he never comes when my mom calls him. In the 11 years we've had him, he has completely bonded to her and barely leaves her side. Now he spends his time chasing Daisy and swatting or hissing at her. 

I'm really at a loss, Max seems kind of depressed that there's a new cat in his house, and I don't want Daisy to hurt him, as she swats back. I know I can't go back in time and keep them apart until Daisy is adjusted better and then gradually introduce them, but is there anything I can do as far as damage control? They don't have to be best friends, but it would be good if I could let Daisy out of my room during the day and not worry about her getting stressed out because Max is following her around and bugging her. 

Any and all advice is appreciated, thank you for reading!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd suggest using oil free facial cleansers, if you aren't already. Urban Decay has a really good setting spray for oily skin, called de-slick or something like that. If you want something cheaper, NYX has a mattifying setting spray as well. You can also buy blotting papers if you're having an extra oily day! Good luck :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I honestly swear by Johnson's baby lotion. It's like $5 for a huge bottle and I put some on before my primer and foundation. It's never made me break out, but I've always had good skin so I would start with a small bottle just in case it doesn't agree with your face. Hope this helps :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have the Naked 2 palette and I absolutely love it, but I would ask someone at wherever you're buying it for their opinion, because it can depend on your skin tone. Especially considering the cost, it would suck to buy one and then end up looking washed out because it doesn't compliment your skin/eye colour. Good luck :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm so pale I'm almost translucent and I use the Hard Candy Glamouflage concealer. It's liquid and covers everything (I think it was originally made for tattoos). I'm Canadian as well so it's available here, and it was about $5 at Walmart. My skin has more yellow/neutral tones though, but they have a few shades so if you can find yours I'd definitely recommend!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Tarte Amazonian Clay foundation is great, however it's full coverage and pretty thick, so I would recommend having a good matte setting powder to go over top, especially if you have combination skin.  </TEXT>
