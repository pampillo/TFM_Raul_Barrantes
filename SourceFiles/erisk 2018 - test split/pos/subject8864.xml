<TITLE> Vegan/Vegetarian Diet and Boxing </TITLE>

<TEXT> Personally, I have nothing against eating meat, but most of it doesn't taste good and it makes me feel sluggish.  I started skipping breakfast, and becoming much more mindful of my food.  I notice that  I feel much better when I force myself to eat majority fruits, vegetables, and high fiber grains.

Is it possible to maintain a fitness for boxing and eat a vegan/vegetarian diet?  What should a meal look like?  And what nutrients should I focus on looking for? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Grades really suck the fun out of math, or school in general for that matter </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-08 04:45:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I remember talking to a colleague in my physics lab from Germany.  He said that for his undergrad career, he didn't take a single test.  Rather, after two years of self study he was required to take a qualification exam and defend in front of a committee.  

Another professor of mine told me  that most of the students at my undergraduate institution were bright students, and the difference between an A and B were like splitting hairs.  I see so many intelligent, bright students leave STEM because of grading politics like this.

I prefer a project based education, where you demonstrate your knowledge of what you've learned in terms of real life applications.

I find grades to be incredibly petty and arbitrary in how it evaluates students.  Most students study to the test, and big picture ideas about how it connects to other subjects is seen as trivia.  This mentality of working towards a grade discourages creativity and critical thinking.  So long as you think like the professor, you'll have a good grade, but is that really learning?

For myself during my masters degree program, the teachers dock points from students on very trivial details.  I remember for one class if you didn't label a certain subscript a certain way, you were docked a whole midterm grade.  

What's even more annoying is my current topology class, I could be off my a word or proof miss a couple steps to the end, and half the points for that test are gone.  It's taking a huge psychological toll on me.  I feel like I can't be a professional mathematician.

I wish I could be in some sort educational institution where the way to graduate is to create something instead of taking a test, like building some sort of machine or presenting a thesis or teaching a class.  

If I don't get into a relatively good PhD program, I'm simply going to give up on STEM.  I don't feel like teaching either because our education system is so messed up.  If the worst happens, my life's work in STEM will be completely meaningless.  I sort of wished I was a hedonistic, greedy child that enjoyed my youth instead of walling myself up in a hole learning trivia like a trained circus animal.  I'd rather be a pompous, greedy wall street douchebag that rips off everyone.  At least I'd be rich living in bliss.  This idea of "working hard" and "studying your passion" feels more and more like BS.  It's propaganda to keep the lower class to work for the rich. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From my experience, most people sitting in a math class feel like what they're learning is irrelevant to their lives.  I don't believe an "well-rounded education" because it imposes values onto the student.  If you really wanted a practical, well rounded person, I think standards should teach students civics, money management, and logic.  These three classes are way more practical than geometry, trig, and calculus to the average student.

I find it strange that once people leave high school, students who enter community college start to really get serious about their education and choose only the best teachers.  The bad ones get low enrollment and eventually get fired if they aren't tenured. 

In public education, there's no real way to let the free market push out the bad teachers.  Once they've tenured, it takes a lot to pry them out, and even then they just get shuffled into another school district.

If I can go into a high school where students, staff, and my fellow teachers are passionate to teach and willing to learn from their mistakes, I'd be more than happy to teach.  Instead, we treat students like inmates.  Some students come from unstructured homes and come from poverty.  Teachers have little to no support in terms of improving, and just a few teachers who slack off impose a huge burden on other teachers, so you create a culture of apathy and stagnation.  Teachers have no ownership of classrooms for various reasons.  Common core makes no sense, and students expect their teachers to be grade mills for doing the bare minimum.    And parents pressure teachers for grade inflation.

I can go on and on, but I don't want to teach in public schools.  Nor does the idea of working for a Big Data company to generate ad revenue excite me either.    Or maybe I should sell-out?  Get tenure as a public school teacher and coast for the rest of my life, and get full pension.  Or sell out at a big data company, make big bucks, and retire.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like that's my backup career.  But I would rather teach community college than public education.  At least in America, it's mostly useless to the students.  Basic arithmetic is mostly what everyone needs.   I believe since public school teachers are tenured, most don't care a slip into a state of perpetual laziness.  There's no future in teaching in my opinion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm about to apply to a PhD program.  I'm currently a masters student.  I'm taking topology, and I just can't get those damn proofs down.  A "C" on the transcript is really bad for grad school.

I've gone to every single office hours, felt like I've engaged with the material, but I just can't seem to perform when tests come!

What's worse is that I'm doing all this studying, and I don't see the joy in what I'm doing. I feel like if I didn't have to take tests, and can study the material at my leisure, things would feel much better.  Not only that, I have some personal goals and needs that I'm not attending to, and I feel like I'm sacrificing my life's work for something that isn't providing me happiness.

I'm not exactly too thrilled about a PhD program either because I feel the same thing might happen.  Nor am I too thrilled about getting a desk job that isn't engaging.

Ironically, I went to the library to borrow a book on the history of math.  It's really exciting to read!  And see how people have invented and challenged themselves with math.  They didn't have to worry about grades either.

What should I be looking forward to?  Should I start taking anti-depressants?  Worst case scenario is that I don't get into a PhD program, wind up unemployed or in a job that has nothing to do with my life's work, only to see myself slowly waste away into nothingness. </TEXT>

I actually applied to a PhD program twice after my BA in physics.  After being rejected by everyone for the first two rounds.  I was completely traumatized and went for a job in industry.  Then after leaving industry, I decided to get my masters degree.

I think I'm still left with the sense of rejection I felt the first two rounds of applying for graduate school.  I'm applying for math instead of physics this time, but there's always the possibility of no one accepting me.  I guess it's not too bad if I apply again after getting my degree, but there's always the fear lingering. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Intro:  M, 27 years old, 5'7" CW: 163lbs, GW: 150

With I've already lost 4 lbs, but I noticed that I feel much more lethargic and stressful.  I haven't been exercising because I'm constantly thinking about school work for grad school.  I am within +/- 100 calories of my daily calculated rate, but sometimes I put in bad calories from junk food, mostly of out convenience and stress eating.

This my just be a hunch, but I notice my arms lost the most weight.  I'm very skinny to begin with, but I see how puny my wrists are, and my biceps lack definition.  Good thing is my stomach pooch is shrinking too, but I feel and look more frail as I notice my size shrinking.

I've been neglecting my mental state too.  I leave the house to school at 7 am, study until 1:30pm in the library.  I set aside 45 min for breakfast and lunch.  And I give myself a couple of 10 minute bathroom breaks.  Immediately when I come home from school, I am so exhausted from thinking that I take a 2-3 hour nap, just to have a break for my mind.  Then I spend 10pm to midnight watching internet shows.  On Fridays when I don't have class, I am so stressed from the entire week that I just spend the day doing nothing productive.  Mostly staying in bed.

I know I need to cut electronics before sleeping.  Should I exercise before sleeping?  Or before I head to school?  Have you guys had similar experiences?  What gave you the needed boost in energy and stamina? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently lost 4 lbs over the last twenty days over a calorie restriction diet.  I don't feel the hunger pangs that much.  In fact I don't feel that hungry at all anymore.  I'm noticing the difference within myself when it comes to muscle pain, hunger pain, and mental stress, which I used to associate with hunger.

I have a different problem now.  After long periods of studying, I feel the numbing fatigue and dull ache all over my body and I have low energy.  I don't feel hungry oddly enough.  And I don't exercise.  How do I get rid of the numbness?  Do I need to start exercising?  Or is this part of the calorie restriction? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Calorie Restriction Diet and Daily Routine </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-06 17:45:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm on a calorie restriction diet, main goal is to lose a lbs a week and go from 165 to 150 before the end of the year, I'm 5'7" btw.  So far I think it's working, I lost two lbs over the last 10 days with the help of a fitness app.  It's kinda weird, I'm feeling losing weight is mostly mental.  I'm starting to separate the difference between actual hunger, mental stress, and physical stress.  For me physical stress makes me lose my appetite, while mental stress from work is triggering my increased appetite.  

Haven't established an boxing routine though.  It's kinda random, I just shadow box or do sit ups when I feel like it.  Any tips?  Would you guys be interested on weekly updates?  Or should I go under a different reddit thread? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello fellow mathematicians?  I know that immediately after the 2008 recession, graduate degrees of all stripes began to question whether the damage was permanent.  Now that it's 2016, has there been new optimism?  I know getting a professorship is still near impossible, and actuaries are in a glut, too.   But what other industries require math PhD's/masters?  What skills from the math department are most valuable to the job market?  

What jobs are out there for a mathematician?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm bisexual.  I've tried dating for 2 years, but got rejected by everyone and haven't gotten a date.  It's damaged my self esteem and confidence a lot.  Now I've decided to concentrate on myself.  I've decided to stop watching porn, change my appearance, and work out.  I feel like I'm not manly enough.  I'm a nerdy bookworm that's very quiet.  I have issues with expressing anger.  I can't find the energy to do anything anymore.  My passion for life has disappeared.  

I thought I was getting better with therapy, but I've regressed.   I've started doing what I wanted, like reading, writing my book, but it hasn't helped.  The next difficult habit i need to maintain is exercise, but I can't even do that.

In fact, I don't think anything I'm doing is helping.  I just want the pain to stop. </TEXT>

I feel I still have to follow a certain stereotype of what a gay man should be.  Sorry, I'm not a white gay male with a body like a Greek marble statue.  Nor do I feel the need to be almost naked in a rainbow of colors shouting queer chants at the top of my lungs.  

Beyond the internet, an LGBT center, and a bar, there really isn't a place where being queer doesn't have any strings attached.  I can't even have a civil conversation with someone LGBT over coffee in public unless I'm eye candy!

Do you guys feel this way?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would feel depressed and lock myself in my room.  I have things to do, but I haven't been acting.  My therapist said I needed to do activities for the sake of my own desire, but I haven't found the will to do anything.

I feel depressed because I don't do anything, and as a coping mechanism I just stay in bed It's a ruthless cycle.I feel like I'm living a meaningless life.

I talked to a therapist this year, he said I'm too passive. I like ppl be judgemental towards me.  I also have an inner critic to pushes me too hard,  and I'm not really doing anything to satisfy myself, all my actions have been towards satifying other ppl.

It started two years ago, when I started graduate school.  I feel like after graduating college and going back home, I felt trapped.  Someone told me to just to something different each day.  But I can't even start to do anything.  Help! </TEXT>

"Gertrude, oh Jesus she's coming out!" said Robert.

A wrinkly, naked zombie version of Gertrude sprang forth from her lower parts and the wrinkly beast writhed in agony over its unnatural existence.

I haven't been getting many views and I felt no one was reading it, so I stopped posting on my blog.  Do you guys have any tips to improve?  Should I pander to my audience with my writing?  Should I use a different host? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've tried dating for 2 years, but got rejected by everyone and haven't gotten a date.  It's damaged my self esteem and confidence a lot.  Now I've decided to concentrate on myself.  I've decided to stop watching porn, change my appearance, and work out.  I feel like I'm not manly enough.  I'm a nerdy bookworm that's very quiet with a very doughy body.  I can't find the energy to do anything anymore.  My passion for life has disappeared.  How do you get it back?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For day 2, I masturbated twice today without porn. Once in the morning when I woke up, and once at noon. Without porn, I had to rely on mental fantasies. But even then it was draining, and my body didn't react to my stimulation. Instead, my body felt tired, but the mental stress was pushing me to orgasm. It drained all the energy out of me, and I went to sleep at skipped lunch. I have a midterm two days from now, and I feel stressed. Before and after each session, there was this lingering dull ache throughout my body. I've been staying indoors studying without any movement. </TEXT>
