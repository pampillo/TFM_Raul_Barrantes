<TEXT> In my opinion that is exactly what your proposed changes would accomplish. Killing infantry is part of piloting, its the only real way you make a difference on the game as a pilot and I'm sick of this misinformation being spread. 

Your changes will make things such that one or two determined players could take out planes on their own without an AA gun. Ridiculous. Any decent team will shoot every plane out of the sky. God forbid an enemy pilot you're trying to dogfight has a squad on the ground with your changes   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your changes would make getting in a plane a total waste of time against any remotely decent team. Everything I've read of yours would lead to a game where Infantry hardly die to planes and planes get shot down in about a minute. Oh and pilots wouldn't be able to score much. 

Only change of yours I agree with is that dogfighting should be more rewarding score wise. I also believe they should make it take time for pilots to bail on their planes, to let the people shooting them down get more kills.

I really don't get how the total percentage of vehicle kills for planes going down makes you think Dice should essentially nerf their air to ground capabilities more.

<TEXT> I fly very well and dogfight with the best of them. After looking at my stats I think you'll find I'm not full of shit. 

The 20 kill thing was refering to conquest btw, I used to do 40-60 pretty consistently in conquest. Operations is where the 80-100+ kill games happened. My best was 129-2. I can still pull off 50ish kills in a full op. It kinda sucks though becasue I could easily get 50 kills as infantry in a full op. I miss feeling like my plane was making a difference. Now I feel like I'm picking off stragglers </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah 99% of people are bad at using the bomber and the Attack plane gets shot down near instantly by anyone on an AA. The attack plane and bomber don't dominate shit most of the time, even when they are the only planes in the sky.

They made the best plane kinda bad and it exposed all the other underused planes because as things stand now you're not making a difference against a remotely decent enemy team as a pilot. They will shoot you down with buffed AAs or let you have your pitiful 20ish kills as the trench fighter. A plane or a tank should have the ability to change the game and as things stand right now planes have had that largely taken from them.  </TEXT>

Its just a big dogfighting fest that results in terrible scores for pilots and no impact for those on the ground. Which is what people begging for these nerfs really wanted.

Attack plane definitely needs that maneuverability buff so some kind of plane can make a difference on the ground again without being shot down every minute.   </TEXT>

Grenades are supposed to be powerful enough to kill people and Dice has taken to steps to keep supports from spamming them every couple seconds like they could when the game came out. They've removed the "magic" resupply as well to appease you people.

But you and people like you will continue to bitch because you just "know" what battlefield 1 should be like since you played battlefield 4.

I can't stand the attitude that the Trench Fighter should be ineffective at killing infantry, when that is the entire point of the loadout. "but its good at air to air" yeah and once you've killed the other planes air to air only loadouts leave you with nothing to do. Players that follow this line of thought just want a game where they never die from the air.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree they should have done a better job with the RSP stuff. 

I just don't think they should balance the game with only PC in mind (there are more console players), as lots of players on this sub seem to think they should. The automatico for example is pretty OP on PC because its easy to hipfire with a Mouse. Meanwhile on console with controllers that aren't great at aiming people using the automatico don't dominate as much. If Dice were to severely nerf the automatico after hearing the PC players, console users would be left with a terrible gun. and thats just one example of the difference in balance between PC and console. 

I almost wish PC and Console just had separate balance and patches.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dice wanted to appeal to more people so they made the game this way. I'm their target audience: Someone that has never really played battlefield before this and bought the game because it looked cool. I now have 350 hours in the game and I like it. Its great to hop on for 3 or 4 hours. 

I see this trend in all of you on this sub reddit that have played the older battlefields. You think your view has to be the correct one because you played old games. You think you just know in your gut what battlefield is and think we should listen. You don't seem to understand that games change over the years and its a good thing. I'd have never played battlefield if they'd kept it the way it used to be. I tried a couple times on BF3 and just thought this is too much.

I'm sure I'm one of those "Casuals" a lot of you hate but I really don't give a damn. Why shouldn't dice cater to gamers like me more than you, when there are way more of us? We're the reason this battlefield sold so many more copies than the last. Go find some indie developer focused on a small group of players if you want a "high skill" game with no good guns or vehicles. Because thats a lot of what you seem to want from your post: Battlefield without the fun/good guns or fun/good vehicles. Don't be such a purist. 

I totally agree with you about the server options though, players should be able to create custom gamemodes and its a shame they can't. I also agree about ammo 2.0, I think its a shit system.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> I read your post. A rear view camera is ridiculous and it takes a lot of the skill out of dogfighting. So what a bomber killer shouldn't be able to sneak up on you and one shot if he catches you off guard? Because he couldn't with your rear view camera idea.

Now you're flat wrong that you can only go by sound. When they shoot, they literally show up on the minimap. Nevermind that if you're using the trench fighter, which who isn't, you can shoot flares. 

If you do have 11 days flying then most of them must be in bombers and attack planes because everyone I know that mains fighter enjoys dogfighting as it is and does a fine job getting people off their tail. The only thing that really stops us is 2 fighters vs 1 fighter. You're right in that its difficult to get a good pilot off your tail, but that is how it should be. As it stands right now in the time I've played maybe 1/20 pilots can consistently kill me once on my tail.  </TEXT>

I've flown for about 3 days of game time and think people crying about "whoever gets on your tail first wins" are bad at piloting. You seriously asking for a always active rear camera? Why don't we just show where all the planes are on the minimap at all times while we're at it? You should be able to figure out where the enemy is behind you based off his bullets (and the fact that he shows up on the minimap when he shoots) and "defend yourself properly". If you're flying randomly and depending on luck to defend yourself then you're one of the scrubs and deserve to get shot down. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't pat yourself on the back too much about being "top 50 in the US" BattlefieldTracker only tracks country leaderboards by people that register their country on the site. They don't just know what players are from what country. 

anyway the vast majority of people that play this game will never care as much as players like you and me. I'd like it if teamplay could be stronger, but the fact of the matter is changes like this will only make the game more frustrating as people continue to play the way they always have.

This game has been out for 6 months, players are set in their ways and a change like this is going to be infuriating. I have a feeling you play on PC as well and it clouds your judgement, as you've never seen casual like a battlefield server on Xbox </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was under the impression that they removed the "magic" ammo regen. 

And you should never depend on players to change. The average person playing this game is a level 20-50 with a PS4 that wants to chill out after work. He is playing to kill and runs stupid gadget setups, like limpet-mortar support. He isn't going to change. 

The instant repair going from 30 to 10 since release is quite the nerf. You just sound like you want an "I win" button from range against the tanks. A clever assault can take out a tank alone easily with at mines and at nades. If using only AT rockets it should take 3+ assaults to take a tank down.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> This change will just result in a game where you have no gadget ammo most of the time and get pissed at all the supports not doing their job. If I had any confidence in supports I wouldn't mind this change, but I have none and I'm certain it will just result in a frustrating experience when spawning assault. Which is of course what most of the people asking for this want, as the assault class is hated in this subreddit. 

Tank nerfs should not be considered. They nerf too much too often and the last thing needed is yet another tank nerf. Tanks are supposed to be powerful. But an assault is also supposed to have the ammo necessary to take it on and after this change they hardly ever will.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In every fps I've ever played it was a guarantee that whenever you spawned back in you'd have full ammo. It makes for a less frustrating experience. The whole sometimes spawning with different amounts of gadget ammo is a direct nerf to an assault class that has been targeted with nerfs more than enough already. In dices quest to make supports more important, they've completely tied assault players hands against tanks and taken away half the fun of the class. Because if there's one thing I know it's that you'll only have a support player willing to resupply you 1/3 matches and the rest of the time you'll get 1 AT nade and 2 AT rockets per life. 

This change won't make support better. It'll just make the other classes worse.

The cool down timers are good though, no need to change them. Just don't do the spawning with hardly any ammo thing. </TEXT>

I just want to play the game I bought without dice drastically changing things every couple months. I'm fine with the explosives. They're supposed to be powerful. And people are out to screw the assault class with this ridiculous nerf because of "spam".    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Those guys you saw were likely in a squad together, and DICE spliting up squads of people that know each other in the name of "balance" would be foolish, even if they did it between games. 

I think you're wanting dice to forcefully switch people to the other team against their will during the match too, which would just lead to a lot of quitting. I'd be pissed if I went from kicking ass to suddenly on the other team getting pummeled.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Part of getting those classes is being powerful. They're supposed to be really good thats the whole point. I think most people around here think a "good" tanker or pilot score should only be like 30-7 and its ridiculous. A good tanker or pilot should be able to use them to change the game and if that means going 90-6 then so be it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The gunners are already plenty powerful. Try to approach a tank with manned side guns as an assault and you'll get shredded. Spreading out the abilities and repair of the tank is a bad idea and yet another example of the subreddit wanting to make a vehicle complete shit under the disguise of "team play". 

These ideas would lead to a frustrating experience as tank driver and a frustrating experience as a player trying to take out the tank. Things that make the game more frustrating don't belong in it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Remove trench fighter from the game" get out of here. I was kinda on the same page until I read that. They should remove the heavy tank too by your logic. They just need to increase dart reload time. 

If the trench fighter bothers you badly to be on the receiving end of, then get good with it and watch as you lay waste to entire teams.  </TEXT>

At the start of the next round, your entire screen will be black and white and you won't be able to hear much as if your character was still in the plane from last round out of bounds. This continues until you die. Can anything be done about this? The end of round glitches/bs deaths are the worst part of piloting </TEXT>

<TITLE> Bayonet Charge suggestions </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-07 00:48:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I understand why the charge is in the game I just have a couple suggestions on how to make it less frustrating for those of us that die to it.

I believe that there are two things that need changing. First, the Bayonet charge should have a "wind up" time. If somone bayonet charges from 2m away they shouldn't get the kill, they have no momentum behind their charge. The way the charge is currently set up allows players to "panic charge" in super close quarters and kill you instantly in pretty unavoidable fashion.

Second, I'd like for the death animation during the Bayonet charge to start later. It seems like I'm locked into an unavoidable death animation while the charger is still 9m from me.

Anyone else have suggestions?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I've been hearing from a lot of people on the battlefield one subreddit that the recent AA nerf is another example in a long line over multiple battlefields of dice favoring pilots. I can understand since they are nerfing the best counter plane tactic in the game, but not nerfing the truly OP trench fighter. 

My question is; dice how can you let pilots get the scores they get (usually in operations) and decide to nerf AA guns but not trench fighters? </TEXT>

Small arms fire is a bad argument and I'm tired of hearing it. Shooting at a plane with an LMG or bolt action is just a good way to do ~10 damage and get killed by the pilot who now knows where you are.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They already made the 10-A kinda bad with their last nerf. Used to be one of my favorites, now in the "nerfed by dice" bin. Assaults are supposed to be wrecking houses up close, and that means more explosives and grenades. they have no great medium range capabilities, so are very powerful up close. And you think we should essentially take away their best gadget because you are tired of dying to it.

Things are balanced, if Dice listened to players like you there wouldn't be any guns or gadgets worth using.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been seeing pilots post around here like the AA nerf is a good thing while they go 50-0 or 100-1. One even had the audacity to post a thread about how to counter planes, which essentially told us to hide. Pilots always use the same word when they describe the things that counter them, "annoying" which perfectly explains the problem. The counter measures in the game don't kill them, or disable them, they annoy them. 

Pilots fess up to the fact that if you're remotely decent with a plane you're guaranteed lots of kills and there isn't much the enemy team can do to take you down. The current strategy of acting like the AA nerf is warranted and its soooo hard to be a pilot just make me and others, I'm sure, dislike you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are a lot of guns in this game that don't have much of a purpose when compared to their peers. The 12g shotgun is one example. I've heard that dice starts nerfing things when too high of a percentage of players are using that thing.

Players are much more excited when something gets buffed than when the hellreigal takes yet another nerf </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a lot of friends and some nights they all want to play. It gets really annoying to try and get 9 people in a game on the same team. What do you guys do to handle this? 

Is there anyway Dice can make it easier to play with more than 5 people? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was a bernie supporter. I'm no more happy with the DNC than the republicans.

I just view Trump as a threat to our democracy. Out to make the media seem evil. Out to say we can only get our news from the president.

Its nefarious and I worry about whats coming. And that fear really makes me hate the people that voted for him and support his authoritarian bullshit.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Battlepack Conspiracy Theory </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-14 22:09:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As we've all noticed, battlepack recipients aren't shown in the post match screen anymore. Some may think this is an innocent change to keep people from knowing who got a pack but I believe dices motives are far more evil. 

Dice will start only giving out 2 or 3 battlepack for a game of conquest and we will be none the wiser! They want us to look at those skins battlepackless and weak. "I just want the dough boy skin" you say to yourself as you give in and buy premium for the superior packs. Just what those bastards wanted 

There's shenanigans afoot.

<TITLE> Tank glitch in Conquest is ridiculous </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've played far too many games of conquest at this point that have been completely ruined by this glitch. One team will have 4 tanks and the other will have 1 or none. And before one of you clever guys tells me "they probably stole your teams tanks", they are all tanker classes in the scoreboard so no they didn't, they spawned into tanks. 

Dice really needs to fix this because there isn't a damn thing you can do when the other team has 4 tanks that instantly spawn back upon destruction.  </TEXT>

How is this for namecalling: You trump voters are ignorant dipshits and I don't care how much you win with your voter suppression and ID laws. You have no morals and clearly want poor people to suffer. You elect people that think religious law is acceptable. 

You people are the worst things about America and I'm ashamed that enough ignorant dipshits voted to cause this.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I keep getting in matches of conquest where over the course of the match one team gets more and more tanks while the other gets none. By mid game the tank team sometimes has 3 or 4 tanks to the other teams none.

This is near gamebreaking. It takes a lot of Assault guys to take out that many tanks with no tank support. I certainly hope this is a bug, because if dice thinks this kind of tank imbalance is a good thing they are fools </TEXT>

So what is it you guys hate? The RNG odds? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It may be a little late in the year to be posting about internships, but I wanted to share some important advice I couldn't find when searching through the subreddit. 

If you still don't have an internship and are looking for one, try checking your career center for upcoming externships. Externships are like business field trips. You tour a company, learn about them, and see their employees in action. You get to hand out your resume while there and frequently get special consideration when it comes to any internship openings the company may have. I know this because its how I got my internship. I went on an externship to a local engineering company. They took notice of me and offered me an internship. 

Take advantage of externships. Going on one has lead to the biggest opportunity of my life.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello Red Pill. I am an Engineering Student in his Jr. year. I've know about the red pill for a long time. I'll spare the bullshit story you've read a thousand times, and say I took it eventually. I'm ready to begin the journey.

Due to school, I have limited time. Its hard to date. So after reading here and thinking, I've decided that the years I have left in school are best dedicated to landing a job to begin my profession and becoming the Alpha I want to be instead of trying to balance carousel-ing college women and difficult classes. 

I started lifting at the school gym between classes last week. I have been eating healthy for several years before now, so I'm not an overweight guy. I'm well over 6 foot. I'm pretty average in build though. I feel like I have all the ingredients to be a mother fucking Alpha male. I just need to stick to the gym, my studies, and the red pill. 

I just fear avoiding all but the easiest women for this time will result in a bad lack of game altogether later however.

Any opinions? I know I will stick to the my degree and diet no matter what, its been years on both lol. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Whats the proudest you've ever been of a grade? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-23 03:46:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My proudest grade is the 100 I just got on my Statics midterm.

Statics probably isn't hard for a lot of you and I'll admit that it isn't once you understand it. At the beginning of the semester I didn't though. I was doing badly in the class. After changing my approach, Quitting my full time job,working through extra problems, and constantly being in my professors office when I was unclear on anything, I've turned a failing grade in late August into a C in October. If I continue on the projection I'm on I will finish with a B. The 100 I earned on my midterm today makes me feel like all the effort I've poured into this class over the past month was worth it. 

I've never worked harder to get a grade. My professor is among the toughest and most respected in the ME department at my Uni. The respect I've seen him develop for me as my grade rises makes me the proudest I've been in school so far. 

So whats your proudest grade? Whats "that" C or B that you had to really work your ass off for?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Thanks to Kyle and PKA, I've been diagnosed with ADHD and my entire life has changed </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-20 03:22:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So Kyle talking about all of adderalls wonderful effects on pka got me wondering about how it treated adhd. That led to some reasearch on ADHD, and that reasearch led to me asking my psychiatrist if I may have it. She referred me to an ADHD specialist, and after about a month of testing I've been diagnosed with it. 

I take Ritalin instead of adderall (it's almost the same) and it has changed my life. I'm a much better student and do the things I need to do, even little things like washing clothes. I love it. 

I really just wanted to say thank you, because without PKA I likely would have went on undiagnosed and continued doing badly in college. Thank you so very much for getting me curious enough to get evaluated Kyle. I'm going to be a mechanical engineer and without this medicine I may have well failed. I'm not condoning use of these pills as study drugs or anything though, please see a doctor before you take any medication

<TITLE> Sweet Delivery Justice </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-15 20:26:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I work at a local place, and we got a call for like a 13 dollar delivery to a road I'd never heard of in the middle of the dinner rush. It was a dirt road 7 miles away. Our range is 5 miles, so naturally I'm pissed. I've got to run a triple and this order will put me behind on everything. Boss says I'm clear to tell them we can't deliver to them again though. Potential justice inbound.

So I pull up to their single wide trailer off a dirt road (which was off of ANOTHER dirt road) and a very "unkept" looking couple came out, complained about the delivery fee (lol) and didn't tip me. It wasn't much, but being able to tell them we couldn't deliver to them again and watching them get angry/disappointed was one of the best feelings. The 7 mile drive back to the store was a very happy one.

Any sweet delivery justice from you guys? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ill be taking calc 3 here soon in the fall and I just finished my calc 2 class. I'm coming out of it with a B, but I'm worried I didn't learn enough. I feel like the only things I learned in this class were extra integration rules and sequences/series. I passed everything but I don't feel like I gained any new understanding like I felt in calculus 1. Is there something important I missed in calc 2 that will bite me in future maths? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Starting planted aquariums for the first time, would love all of your inputs </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-12 21:07:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have been out of the aquarium hobby for about a year now, but before that I maintained a 20 gallon aquarium for 6 years. It went very well, and my mother maintains it these days. I've also kept several betta fish in 3 gallon or so aquariums. 

This will be the first time I'm approaching planted aquariums. My apartment doesn't allow a tank size larger than 10 gallons (bullshit, I know) so I'm looking ot make the nicest tank I can. I already have many of the things for the tank, left over from the years. Heater, filter, thermometer, chemicals, net, decorations, etc... are taken care of.

I've done a lot of lurking on the sub and read many articles on starting a planted tank. I am just having a hard time figuring out exactly what plants to use. My LFS doesn't have a ton of options, but the owner said that I came on the tail end on a shipment and a new one would be in soon.

Here are the plants my LFS currently has, and will continue to have:

Aquatic Clover

Anubis

Dwarf Sagittaria

Micro Sword

Amazon Sword

Cabomba

Italian Val

Dwarf Pennywort

Corkscrew Val

Dwarf Hair Grass

Java Moss

Java Fern

They can order things specially for me, but it will take time.

I've narrowed my fish decision down to three species:

Cobra Endlers

Dwarf Rasbora Boraras

Cardinal Tetras

What are you suggestions on plants for the 3 gallon Betta tank? What are your suggestions on plants for the 10 gallon? What are your fish suggestions? I'm open to any. I need people more knowledgeable on this topic than me for help. Thank you

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm sure we are all familiar with "Woody Wisdom." It comes on PKA all the time. The main thing that has always stuck out to me about Woody is his work ethic. I hear about it on his channel and PKA all the time. I can't remember what video or PKA this is from, but Woody had one quote that really stuck with me. He was talking about how to make yourself a better person. He said that we should do hard things, "Because no one ever impressed anyone by doing something easy". Bam. I don't know what it is about that phrase but I love it. You have to do something most people can't do. Thanks to Woody, I changed my major to Mechanical Engineering (What I wanted for a while but thought would be too hard) and work full time at a warehouse. I'm doing great in school, and have realized that this is what I want to do. I work a lot and have more money than most people I know my age. I'm happy. To throw in a little Hutch here too, I did esteem-able things. It really does build self esteem. But I have woody to thank for inspiring the work ethic in me. I never thought I could work this hard, but I just keep thinking: No one ever impressed anyone by doing something easy. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What are your best, worst, and realistic expectations for the rest of your teams season? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-11-01 17:32:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Clemson Tigers

Best: Clemson wins out, destroying Virginia, and Georgia Tech like they should, and beating South Carolina at the end of the season by double digits as the offense reawakens and plays to its potential. The offensive line grows a ball sack and the team doesn't give up on the season. Clemson goes 11-1 and goes to a BCS bowl to end the season, hopefully winning.

Worst: Clemson continues on the downward spiral it has been on and plays a close game against Virginia, narrowly avoiding the upset. Clemson loses to Georgia Tech at home before going to South Carolina and getting absolutely embarrassed in a 30+ point blow out. I drink enough to nearly induce Alcohol poisoning. Clemson goes 9-3, finishing in the gator bowl where we pray for a win of some sort.

Realistic: Clemson rebounds and blows out Virginia. They struggle with Georgia Tech for awhile, but pull away in the end and win by double digits. Going into South Carolina, Clemson's offensive line cannot handle the South Carolina defensive line and Tajh Boyd gets rattled. Clemson loses by double digits and the Gamecocks make it 5 in a row. Dabo's seat starts getting hot as we go 10-2 and go to the Chick-fil-a bowl. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, Kyle was right. It is a great movie if you like movies with the gangster feel to them. It has a good romance plot in it, if you like that sort of thing, and there is very realistic action. This movie shows how real bank robbers would operate, and I think you guys should check it out if you have some free time!

Oh and I am just fine with Ben Afflack playing Batman now. He is a very gritty character in The Town. </TEXT>

<TITLE> A Clemson fans honest opinion on the Florida State game </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-10-14 00:52:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm worried. Why? Because I feel like the Las Vegas line is correct. I think we are going to lose next weekend. Clemson is a great team. But some inconsistencies I have noticed are going to cost us if we don't fix them.

**Defense**: This is the side I'm actually not that worried about. They have played great, and do better every week. Our safeties are looking bad though. They bite hard on the play action, and are not the best at coverage period. Our front seven brings great pressure, and stuffs the run pretty well. Our cornerbacks are shaky, but they are much improved from last year. I think FSU will score less points than they think, and I think our defense is very underrated this year.

**Offense:** Now this is where I am worried. Everyone thinks our offense is our strong point. It can be. But this year, we have a glaring weakness. Tajh Boyd is an excellent QB, and a Heisman contender for a reason. Skill positions are remarkable, every one of our wide receivers is a weapon. Roderick McDowell and Zack Brooks are great running backs. Our weakness? The offensive line. I've hoped they would improve all year. But they are regressing. They do not play physical. Our run game is suffering because they cannot get a push. Our pass game is suffering because they cannot pick up even basic blitzes. They looked TERRIBLE against both Boston College and Syracuse. Florida State is going to blitz us all day, and I'm worried Tajh Boyd will become very rattled because of our Offensive Lines inability to stop them. The inability of our Offensive line to push the defense has cost us in the red zone, and it will continue to cost us.

**The Competition:** I do not know enough about Florida state to really judge them. They have played inferior competition in every game I've seen. I don't know how Famous Jameis will respond to an extremely hostile environment. I don't know how good they really are. My gut tells me that they are great though. Their defense will exploit our lack of protection if we can't improve against the blitz, that is for sure. If Boston College and Syracuse can do it, Florida State surely can.

**My Verdict:** Clemson can win this game. I do not doubt it. But in order for it to happen, the Offensive line play will have to improve dramatically. I feel confident in every other area of our game. But the Offensive line is the single most important position group on the field. And if they don't have a great week of practice, and get physical, it is going to be a long game.

Opinions? (Change this drunk guys view. PLS) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sports other than UFC aren't really discussed on PKA, and I'm curious to see if any of the hosts are interested in Football. College or professional. I'm interested in both, and my teams are Clemson and the Steelers (sob). I think Kyle is a Georgia bulldog fan. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How to fix this subreddit, and get the hosts back on here </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-28 00:06:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Its simple really. Stop with the "constructive criticism" especially when it comes to woody's channel. I don't recall ever being asked to give criticism. This sub is for us to laugh at funny PKA memes or gifs or jokes. Its to discuss PKA. It is not to circle jerk everything that is wrong with PKA/Woody's Channel/Wings. So please just chill out. I know I liked things better when the hosts liked the sub, said good things about it, and when woody commented on things. So lets focus on being a funny laid back subreddit again, and move away from being Fucknards in the bad sense of the word. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seriously, PKA is one of the best things to help get over stuff with. It's nice to listen to Woody, Kyle, Wings, and Lefty shoot the shit. It keeps my mind off things and keeps me happy.
I guess in the words of wings "Don't put the Pussy on a pedestal"  </TEXT>
