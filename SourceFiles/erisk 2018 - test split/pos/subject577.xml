<TEXT> Again, reading comprehension. The start of the context is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/645phg/moderators_discover_that_reddit_is_brutal_when/dfzwvvi/), which is what /u/literallydontcaree didn't understand.

And no, you said explicitly, absolutely, definitely, exactly, precisely:

I don't get why anyone would seek community on something as silly as an online forum.

That's a direct quote. An exact quote. An explicit quote. I understand that your explicit quote was "general," because I have basic reading comprehension.

<TEXT> That's fair.

The same Claudia Goldin you quote says in the article

Does that mean that women are receiving lower pay for equal work?  That is possibly the case in certain places, but by and large **its not that, its something else.**

Further down

Some of the best studies that we have of the gender pay gap, following individuals longitudinally, show that when they show up right out of college, or out of law school, or after they get their M.B.A.  all the studies that we have indicate that wages are pretty similar then. So if men were better bargainers, they would have been better right then. And it doesnt look as if theyre better bargainers to a degree that shows up as a very large number.  **But further down the pike in their lives, by 10-15 years out, we see very large differences in their pay**. But we also see large differences in where they are, in their job titles, and a lot of that occurs a year or two after a kid is born, and it occurs for women and not for men. **If anything, men tend to work somewhat harder.** And I know that there are many who have done many experiments on the fact that women dont necessarily like competition as much as men do  they value temporal flexibility, men value income growth  that there are various differences. But in terms of bargaining and competition it doesnt look like its showing up that much at the very beginning.

The woman will then begin to make  if shes the one who did this  she will make considerably less than the man.  And a lot of what we see  not all of it  but **a lot of what we see is this choice to go into occupations that have less expensive temporal flexibility, that allow individuals to do their work on their own time.**

Further, you say "the gender pay gap still persists even within the same indurstries."

But Goldin says 

So, the ones that have the smallest difference between male and female earnings with these corrections are the technology occupations and the science occupations and the health occupations where there is a small degree of self-employment  as is true today for, for example, pharmacists.

And that the largest differences are in "the corporate, the financial sectors, also law, and the health occupations in which there is a high fraction of ownership."

It's *really* simplistic to say that women earn 0.73 on the dollar to men. On the whole, it's true, but case-by-case it often is not. 

And when it is true, it is a self-inflicted choice *by the woman* to take the job with more flexible hours, less stress, etc.

What do you want in our legal system? The ability to force employers to pay the same amount to women even if they take the easier hours and do less work?

Secondly freakonomics is incredibly guilty of cherry picking their data

that is such a lazy reply. At least give me some references, don't just throw it out there with no context. Freakonomics here quotes **the same** person that you did from the nytimes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Obama set the tone for his presidency when he said "Republicans need to understand that elections have consequences. And I won."

He spent his first four years brow beating Republicans and passing the ACA. The Republicans never forgot that. 

Anything you see now is the Democrats getting a taste of their own medicine. "

and

"Which was in response to how the democrats treated us from 08'-'10. And it can go on and on. We need to mend bridges because those in power have an obligation to the entire nation not just their individual constituency, regardless of how things have been down in the past."

and

"In part, that's because the use of the filibuster has increased dramatically. Invocation of cloture was at a peak under Obama because use of the filibuster was at a peak by the GOP minority in the Senate in Obama's first term."

I mean, this is in just part of the top thread.

Republicans were asses to Obama for eight years. Astoundingly obstructionist, voting "no" on things they would have historically supported, trying everything they could to make him a 1-term (lol to that) President. The GOP is *so shocked* that the Democrats were rude to Trump. The incredible short-term memory being shown by **both** parties is just unbelievable.


And now, of course, you're trying to hide behind Biden's precedent! Do you even basely understand how your two points conflict?

Are Democrats in the right here? Of course not. Were the Republicans in the right for the last 8 years? Of course not.

<TEXT> Nah, bullshit. Just don't bite people.

Reminds me of The Office, where Michael has to figure out which of his employees is gay so he doesn't make any gay jokes towards them. Dwight says "Well why don't you treat everyone like they're gay?"

Other people can playfully punch each other and everyone is fine

No, actually. Most people don't like being punched.

but if I do it I ~~accidentally~~ **intentionally** hurt someone.

Stop minimalizing your bad behavior.

A bite is my version of a kiss on the cheek. 

Doesn't a kiss, or a bite, or any physical interaction require an idea of consent? 

Don't be a dick. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello!

I have a Belkin N600DB Wireless Router. I've just moved it one floor below my computer, but proximity wise it's maybe 15 feet away. My computer can see both networks, but will not connect to the 2.4ghz. The 2.4 appears to have full bars on Windows 10 Network Settings, but as soon as I attempt to connect it fails or has no bars.

If I walk into a room on the other side of the router (computer - router/wall - room) I have a fantastic 2.4ghz signal.

Thoughts? I don't know that it really matters, since the 5ghz is giving me 30Mbps (exactly what I pay for).

Thanks! </TEXT>

Mormons don't believe that they are forcing their beliefs on anyone. Yes, the do baptisms and other religious ordinances for dead people, but Mormons believe that the dead person has the *choice* to accept the ordinance in the afterlife. They believe that without the soul of the person making the conscious choice, then the ordinance counts for nothing. Mormons think they're just giving dead people more options in the afterlife. </TEXT>

Yes, sunlight can cause skin cancer. We actively take steps to help mitigate skin cancer. We should wear long sleeves, apply sunscreen, and avoid the sun during the peak part of the day. You seem to advocate for protection from the sun.

Yes, of course suicide is a mental health problem. However, mental health problems can be exacerbated by outside influences. One of these outside influences appears to be the teachings of the LDS church.

How should we go about helping to mitigate potential causes of suicide? In particular, the teachings of the LDS church?

Simple: We should avoid the LDS church. We should ignore it's teachings, avoid peak LDS teaching times (Conferences, church on Sunday, etc.) We should actively seek to support and love all fellow human beings.

You should be advocating for protection from the Gospel, /u/bhroberts. </TEXT>

So you wouldn't, then. Man, that's awfully shallow of you. Why wouldn't you date someone fat? They have a lovely personality, and they're so kind and loving! You're super shallow.

You wouldn't date someone significantly shorter than you? That's even more shallow than not wanting to date someone who's fat! At least the fat person can control their weight. The short guy has no control. You're super shallow. If you could just get past the height, you'd see he's a really great guy!

JFC, how do you think that any information leaks out ever? If you actually wanted to avoid the drama, you wouldn't have ranted for 5 minutes. If you really wanted to avoid the drama, you wouldn't put your current SO on the phone with your **ex**. If I was dating someone who was so obviously still hung up on what her ex thought of her, I'd break up with them.

If you didn't want drama, you wouldn't have gotten involved at all on facebook. If you didn't want drama, you wouldn't be here, arguing with everyone who dares to not see things your way.

Tom won't break up with you because you're fat, Tom will break up with you because you cause and seek drama.

There's literally no such thing as a "legitimate" reason to dump someone. If they don't make you happy and fulfilled, for *whatever* reason, then break up!

Would you date someone a foot shorter than you? What if they were not intelligent? What if they were living below the poverty line?

<TEXT> Alright, hon, let's play some association games. In the OP:

OP's sister was **cheated** on, but SIL is **pregnant**.

In dash's comment:

Kevin has **cancer**, but it's Michael's **birthday**.

So, let's look for the similarities!

Someone has **something shitty**, but someone else has **something good**.

THAT is the point here. Cheif never said that cheating = cancer!

And, frankly, if you can't understand this, reread your last sentence.

Have a great day, pumpkin. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You might need to learn how to express yourself better. You said "Cheating happens every day" and "its not the end of the world." For both of these statements, you can insert "cancer" for "cheating" and the meaning remains the same. You did **not** say "cancer is worse than cheating."

Maybe if you learned how to adequately say what you mean, you wouldn't get showered in downvotes.

<TEXT> To leave the church, all you have to do is write a letter to your bishop saying you want your name off the records of the church.

Per Handbook 1, this isn't entirely correct.

The church has no policy to contact you again, harass you, or anything of the sort.

"If members of the stake presidency determine that the bishop has followed established procedures, they ask him to **send the member a letter** stating that his or her name is being removed... as requested."

Oh, and the handbook also illegally makes the person wait 30 days.

"Removal can be rescinded only if the member sends the stake president a written request for the recision within 30 days... If a member demands that his or her name be removed immediately, the 30-day waiting period may be eliminated."

<TEXT> Yes, this person sent the letter to the wrong people. It just has to go to your bishop.

How would the person know that that's the church's "policy"? Anyways, this letter is technically illegal. Once the church receives notice of a resignation, it's **done**. There's no special hoops to jump through. There is legal precedent, see [here](http://www.mormonnomore.com/legal-precedent).

Further, have the congregants been taught this rule they have to jump through? Has this been printed in the Ensign?

Anything else is just bad choices by their local leaders, not a church policy.

Again, so why is the church so damn bad at training their leaders? Because as /u/choose_the_rice points out, it's an endemic problem. It happens to *a lot* of people.

Right, because joining a totalizing religion like Mormonism is "simple." More information is always helpful. Also, it's a reddit comment. It's one thing if they were face to face and he rattled it all off, but she can take her time and take it chunks at a time.

<TEXT> That's a fair interpretation, thank you.

What about people who are Mormon, are endowed, are members in good standing, but never marry? They have knowledge of the covenant, but never used it. Would you say they have accepted, rejected, or are in the same limbo as people who never heard the gospel? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Are you trying to force a specific interpretation?

Of course not, but wouldn't you agree that a direct reading of the text is a good starting point to understanding the text?

It would be contrary to God's mercy to deny blessings to those who never learned it or had an opportunity to receive it.

But that's how the verses seem to read. If they are not married "by my word," the marriage is not in force when they are dead. Therefore, they are angels forever. Therefore, doing proxy sealings does nothing, because they are angels forever. That is the direct and clearest reading, and I am wondering if there is any clarification from other scriptures or prophets. Can I clarify my question further at all? </TEXT>

<TEXT> But according to a direct reading of the verses, they're dead, and thus cannot even accept the covenant to begin with.

Is everyone before the 1830s servants forever? Is every nonmormon post-1830s servants to gods? Because they're *dead*, and thus cannot, according to a straight reading, even be sealed in the first place. </TEXT>

But, v16 explicitly states that those who are out of the world cannot marry, because they were not married "by me nor my word," which implies Temple sealing. So, why do proxy sealings? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've asked this question a few times, and have never received a reply from those I've asked.

Mormons routinely do sealings and endowments for the dead. However, D C 132:15-17 seems to explicitly bar this as even a possibility.

15 Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry her not by me nor by my word, and he covenant with her so long as he is in the world and she with him, their covenant and marriage are not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of the world; therefore, they are not bound by any law when they are out of the world.

16 Therefore, when they are out of the world they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but are appointed angels in heaven, which angels are ministering servants, to minister for those who are worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of glory.

17 For these angels did not abide my law; therefore, they cannot be enlarged, but remain separately and singly, without exaltation, in their saved condition, to all eternity; and from henceforth are not gods, but are angels of God forever and ever.

This seems explicitly clear: If you are not sealed in the temple while alive, you cannot be married after you are dead. You must be a servant forever.

Has there ever been clarification by a prophet or an apostle? How did they go around this incredibly clear modern-day scripture? </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my experience, singles wards are fully of adult children who have been denied any sort of maturity from adults.

Groups of twenty-something men and women who have to be "supervised" by people old enough to be there parents. Activities of "board games" and "movie night with popcorn." Going dancing, but like a middle school dance. Lots of passive aggressive petty gossip and backstabbing, constant name dropping, constant appeals to authority. If you're a man, if you didn't serve a mission, you're lesser. If you're a woman, you'll be awkwardly hounded by naive men looking for a wife.

And then there's the Mormon beliefs themselves!

Three hour church blocks of inane babble. No coffee, no tea, no alcohol. Don't have more than one ear piercing, don't wear tank tops, don't have shorts that go higher than above the knee. Noah's Flood and the Tower of Babel are literal events. Polygamy is *wink wink* "not practiced," but still believed in. Black people are lesser because they were 'less valiant' in the pre-existence. If Native Americans are righteous, then they'll turn white.

Gays are okay as long as they never ever act gay. Women should stay at home and defer to their husbands. If the Prophet says it, the thinking has been done. The Earth is 6,000 years old. Ancient Jews made boats, sailed to America, had a battle of **millions** of people that literally came down to 1v1. 

You can become a God. There are infinite numbers of Gods. Gods are men, women are goddesses "unto their husbands." Oh, and those gods have many wives. A lot is talked about Heavenly Father. What about Heavenly Mother? Almost literally nothing.

Don't do it, OP. What's good about Mormonism isn't unique, and what's unique isn't good. </TEXT>

Who is judging us on these errors and sins? God. Why can't he just absolve everyone? Bam, done. No need for Christ.

Joseph Smith was such a prophet

Joseph Smith was a con man and adulterer, fraudster and serial liar. 

Book of Mormon is the very valid evidence

If you have no external way to test the validity, then it's bullshit. Many tests given to it in almost every scientific field lead to the same conclusion, bullshit.

Mozart

Mozart wasn't acting on behalf of an omniscient and omnipresent deity. He didn't claim to have divine favor. Further, comparing Mozart to fraudster Joseph Smith is a huge insult to Mozart.

Book of Mormon's teachings concerning Christ

The BoM has what unique Mormon doctrines again? Polygamy? Temple? Proxy baptism? Infinite gods?

<TEXT> Of course not. Read *Guns, Germs, and Steel*, take some anthropology classes, think about it logically. Absence of *expected* evidence is evidence of absence. 

"A fire-breathing dragon lives in my garage" Suppose (I'm following a group therapy approach by the psychologist Richard Franklin[3]) I seriously make such an assertion to you. Surely you'd want to check it out, see for yourself. There have been innumerable stories of dragons over the centuries, but no real evidence. What an opportunity! 

"Show me," you say. I lead you to my garage. You look inside and see a ladder, empty paint cans, an old tricycle--but no dragon. 

"Where's the dragon?" you ask. 

"Oh, she's right here," I reply, waving vaguely. "I neglected to mention that she's an invisible dragon." 

You propose spreading flour on the floor of the garage to capture the dragon's footprints. 

"Good idea," I say, "but this dragon floats in the air." 

Then you'll use an infrared sensor to detect the invisible fire. 

"Good idea, but the invisible fire is also heatless." 

You'll spray-paint the dragon and make her visible. 

"Good idea, but she's an incorporeal dragon and the paint won't stick." And so on. I counter every physical test you propose with a special explanation of why it won't work. 

Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all? If there's no way to disprove my contention, no conceivable experiment that would count against it, what does it mean to say that my dragon exists? Your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true. Claims that cannot be tested, assertions immune to disproof are veridically worthless, whatever value they may have in inspiring us or in exciting our sense of wonder. What I'm asking you to do comes down to believing, in the absence of evidence, on my say-so.

<TEXT>  there are many people within these religions that know that we are on many right roads. 

Source? Because, moving out of Utah, I came to the realization that the rest of the world really doesn't give a fuck about Mormonism. They don't know about it, they don't know what the prophets teach, they don't know the beliefs.

Five minutes ago I just answered a question from a coworker. She asked if Mormons could *listen to music*. Most people outside of Utah really, really don't know or care about Mormonism. </TEXT>

 15 Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry her not by me nor by my word, and he covenant with her so long as he is in the world and she with him, their covenant and marriage are not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of the world; therefore, they are not bound by any law when they are out of the world.

 16 **Therefore, when they are out of the world they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but are appointed angels in heaven**, which angels are ministering servants, to minister for those who are worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of glory.

 17 For these angels did not abide my law; therefore, they cannot be enlarged, **but remain separately and singly, without exaltation**, in their saved condition, to all eternity; **and from henceforth are not gods**, but are angels of God forever and ever. </TEXT>

Which civs are better for Tall or Wide? Going wide, do you have any tips to counteract Unhappiness?

<TEXT> Depends on whether the Mormon thinks that Smith used a "tight" or "loose" translation. Tight = wrote exactly what God said, word for word. Loose = God revealed the general 'idea' of the passage and Smith injected his own feelings. Both have their issues.

I would argue that in practice, the BoM is held absolutely infallible.

I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book. - Joseph Smith (History of the Church, 4:461.)

https://www.lds.org/ensign/1984/06/the-most-correct-book?lang=eng

If a Mormon says they don't think the BoM is infallible, ask them what they think is wrong with it. Chances are, they don't think anything is wrong with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If it's a Mormon demon, [try shaking it's hand first](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/129?lang=eng)

 4 When a messenger comes saying he has a message from God, offer him your hand and request him to shake hands with you.

 5 If he be an angel he will do so, and you will feel his hand.

 6 If he be the spirit of a just man made perfect he will come in his glory; for that is the only way he can appear

 7 Ask him to shake hands with you, but he will not move, because it is contrary to the order of heaven for a just man to deceive; but he will still deliver his message.

 8 If it be the devil as an angel of light, when you ask him to shake hands he will offer you his hand, and you will not feel anything; you may therefore detect him.

Remember: Demons are too stupid to try to lie by *not* shaking your hand. </TEXT>

Is your heat gas or electric? [Climate data](http://www.usclimatedata.com/climate/lincoln/nebraska/united-states/usne0283) says that the average temperature is 50/28 (high/low). What is your thermostat set at? If it's at 70ish, I bet you can go down to 65 or 63 and still be relatively warm (although you may want to get a blanket and slippers).

How many windows do you have? Single pane, or multi-pane? How many doors, and does that door lead outside? Is there a large amount of space between the door and frame? Are the walls cinderblock or wood? Are the insulated? What floor are you on? Do you have a skylight?

There are a lot of little fixes to make your home more weatherproof, they are cheap and will save you money this winter. Window films, weatherstripping, door sweeper things, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One difficulty was a general lack of understanding of the Handbook itself

Maybe because it's secret and hidden?

With same-sex marriage now legal in the United States and some other nations, the Church felt the need specifically to address such marriages in the Handbook to draw a firm line and encourage consistency among local leaders.

They didn't feel the need until TSCC lost on Prop 8 and gay marriage in general, *in the United States*. TSCC is not a global church, it is an American church.

In reality, very few same-sex couples would bring children for the formal Church ordinance of naming and blessing, since this creates a formal membership record. But Church leaders want to avoid putting little children in a potential tug-of-war between same-sex couples at home and teachings and activities at church.

Bullshit! The initial policy was explicitly clear, "child of a parent who has lived or is living in a same-gender relationship." If the biological parents are divorced and one is not LDS anymore and is in a gay relationship, the children are subject to the rule change. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The provisions of Handbook 1, Section 16.13, that restrict priesthood ordinances for minors, **apply only to those children whose primary residence is with a couple living in a same-gender marriage** or similar relationship.

This is a significant walkback from the earlier instructions of Handbook 1, 

A natural or adopted child of a parent living in a same-gender relationship, whether the couple is married or cohabiting,

What if a never-LDS woman is bisexual, and lives with another woman in college. Years later, she converts, marries a man, and has kids. Her children, even though she repented, were fucked over with the initial policy change.

When a child living with such a same-gender couple has already been baptized and is actively participating in the Church, provisions of Section 16.13 do not require that his or her membership activities or priesthood privileges be curtailed or that further ordinances be withheld.

This is a significant walkback from the very clear initial instructions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Adam-God was taught in the Temple in the Endowment Ceremony. It's not just some silly one-off teaching by 'Backwards Brigham." The Adam-God Doctrine (and it was doctrine) [still informs](http://mormonthink.com/QUOTES/adamgod.htm) some [modern-day Mormon beliefs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/2riyqb/adamgod_is_still_vestigially_a_part_of_current/)

The First Vision accounts are not contradictory. No early member of the Church claimed that Joseph changed his story, or contradicted himself.

Oh come on. The are blatantly contradictory. "No early member of the Church" even **knew** about the 'First Vision," since in the early years Joseph didn't tell anyone.

RE: #9, it's a valid point. Absence of expected evidence is evidence of absence. The BoM anachronisms are called anachronisms for a reason.

RE: #16, luckily, I think the Bible is bullshit too, so I can still question the "4000 changes" made to the BoM. True, most changes were typos, but some were doctrine-changing in nature. They moved from a strictly Trinitarian to a distinct 3-member Godhead.

RE: #20, Grace v. Works, I'm just tickled that FAIR gives a [dead link](http://en.fairmormon.org/index.php?title=Grace action=edit redlink=1) to grace. Truly professional.

RE: #27, the BoM is [not in "perfect King James" English](http://www.mormonthink.com/backup/linguistic.htm). On the contrary, many basic grammatical mistakes are still in the BoM.

Martin Harris lost them, and in rebuke, God took Joseph's power of prophesy, the plates, and the interpreters. Eventually Smith got the former two back, but **not the interpreters**.

This forum is, in my opinion, to talk about mormon things. I don't think it's here so people can be preached to. When a talk is posted with no comment, it feels like I'm being preached to. Here are some links to your comments; [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/3psa90/the_holy_ghost_as_your_companion/cw9bhh5?context=3), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/3picfe/unless_i_believe_in_god_i_cannot_believe_in/cw9au0v?context=3), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/3picfe/unless_i_believe_in_god_i_cannot_believe_in/cw9abc1?context=3), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/3psa90/the_holy_ghost_as_your_companion/cw99q7p?context=3), [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/3pkwcp/the_full_list_of_pres_monsonss_testimonies_from/cw8ytke?context=3), [6](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/3picfe/unless_i_believe_in_god_i_cannot_believe_in/cw7b9jh?context=3).

It's insulting and patronizing. No one is here to be called to repentance, or rebuked, or whatever. They're here to ask, discuss, and question all aspects of mormonism or being a mormon. When you say things like "it is not my job to teach you if you are unwilling to learn," or "Great work quoting the article, now, use words to formulate a sentence that articulates your point of view on the subject of the Holy Ghost." or "If there ever was a need to point out the difference between the letter of the law and the spirit of the law it would be for this exact conversation. I will speak to you in the most plain words I can use," or "Don't you remember the warnings from the scriptures? Look you may not agree with the Book of Mormon or Joseph Smith, **but heed this wise counsel,** and notice too that today you have fulfilled this prophecy," you presume that you hold the absolute truth. There's no humility there! You have no authority over anyone in this forum, or in real life, frankly.

People downvote you because you're preachy and come across as self-righteous. I was frustrated when you completely ignored my points about how Smith was an adulterer. It felt and feels like you don't read to comprehend what the other person is saying, you read to figure out how to pull the other person back 'into the fold.' It's insulting, and of course you'll be downvoted for it. </TEXT>

Maybe contain the negative vibe of a lot of your comments?

mormbn keeps reminding me that we should refrain from personal attacks on this subreddit.

to then launch directly into a personal attack,

To answer you simply, I don't agree with your interpretation of the Joseph Smith quote. I believe that you have made an error in your understanding. However, it is not my job to teach you if you are unwilling to learn. I would ask you if you are an expert on the teachings of Joseph Smith, why don't you follow them? If you don't follow them then why do you know so much about him? If it is because you find Joseph Smith to be dishonest or untrustworthy and are therefore inclined to "educate" other's about his dishonesty? If your purpose is only to dissuade people from believing in the church, when then I think your own purpose speaks for itself.

My point it to persuade others to do good, if you will not contribute to this discussion then I would politely ask you to not say anything at all.

.

I honestly don't think we're talking about the same thing.

Great work quoting the article, now, use words to formulate a sentence that articulates your point of view on the subject of the Holy Ghost. Please avoid introducing topics that are completely unrelated to the church and it's doctrine.

.

This has got to be the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard on the internet. If there ever was a need to point out the difference between the letter of the law and the spirit of the law it would be for this exact conversation. I will speak to you in the most plain words I can use.

.

I guess it might be too hard if typing in "Book of Mormon and DNA" in the search bar is a difficult challenge.

.

I would review it with you but It appears you are more interested in silencing my "belief system" than actually finding answers.

.

Well I'm glad to hear your committed. In fact i wouldn't have it any other way.


.

Can you say the same? Are you willing to die believing that he was fraud? I didn't think so.

.

When you can come up with that evidence of a flawed revelation then we can start.

.

 3 Never has there been greater love than this, between the ponderizer and the, what do you call yourself? I want to say anti-mormon but then you might get offended.
.

Here we go I found the statement from Elder Durrant. For future reference when making an argument it's best to use the source. The claim you have made is too preposterous for the amount of evidence you have supplied. You have only found a lose connection, and that connection is only your assumption and belief that Durrant is deceiving you. Your logical fallacy is anecdotal, using an isolated example instead of a sound argument or compelling evidence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anti-mormon is a loaded and mis-used term. I don't like judaism. Am I anti-Semitic? No, and I think it's arguably libelous to say so.

How is the leaked text of the Heavenly Mother essay anti-mormon? Had /r/exmormon leaked the text to the Blacks and the Priesthood essay, would that essay be anti-mormon? Are all of the other essays on lds.org also anti-mormon?

The church **did** and *does* lie about it's history. If the historical truth is anti-mormon, then Mormonism is in for a rough ride.

In an open forum, the dominant voices will almost always drown out the rest. This is why /r/lds and /r/latterdaysaints are decidedly *not* open, because that's the only way that they can maintain any semblance of control. /r/mormon and /r/exmormon are much more open than either of the former.

One reason that I downvote anyone, exmo, TBM, or nevermo, is when they wholly disregard what the other person has said, and continue to push their own agenda. It's a conversation, and when the other person's point isn't even acknowledged, then I downvote. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  How can we be so caught up in our own pride to say that we don't need God anymore?

People can need to feel a part of something bigger. Religious feelings probably even have an evolutionary backing. This doesn't mean god is real, though.

How is saying that science doesn't need god the "pride of man"? Take the biochemical pathway of Glucose - ATP. We know every step. We know how the molecules change, we know the enzymes, we know the energy input and output. **There is no step that says**, "*INSERT GOD HERE*".

Science doesn't need god. None of our explanations for the workings of the Universe need "god" to explain how they work.

Again, so why add one? Do humans add "god" just because they can't fathom how things work without a deity? That's entirely fallacious. I don't understand quantum mechanics. I don't then go, "well my imaginary friend Zachary has little quantum fingers, that manipulate the higgs field." That's ridiculous!

Then, of course, there is the "why". Earlier, you said "Yes, because "why". Science does not, cannot answer why."

Religion can't answer the "why" of God. Why does God exist? In the Mormon framework, where did God come from? The pride of religion is, "we can't understand, so we can insert god without any good reason." </TEXT>

<TEXT> What are you jaded about with the catholic church? Because I'm pretty sure that direct parallels could be found with the Mormon church.

My advice is: Don't do it. The mormon church is sexist, misogynistic, homophobic, racist, and anti-science. The things unique to mormonism aren't good, and the things that are good about mormonsim can be found elsewhere in a less-damaging format.

Hop on over to /r/exmormon to explore the bad side of mormonism. Read the [CES letter](http://cesletter.com/) to explore things that the visitor's center and sister missionaries aren't telling you.

You've being pushed a sales pitch. They want your commitment and they want your money. Find second and third opinions at places that are neutral, and are not pro-mormon.

<TEXT> I can't imagine what would make someone do something like that.

Religion, Mormonism. Leaving the church is worse than physical death, doctrinally. My cousin left and he and his dad regularly get in yelling matches. See, the father has a patriarchal blessing that says that all his children will be faithful. 

Patriarchal blessings are conditional. Since my cousin left, it's "obviously" the fathers fault, he must have not been righteous enough. 

I've seen families and friendships ripped apart, simply because they can't agree on what happens when we die. There's a reason that /r/exmormon is so large relative to, say, /r/excatholic. 

The Mormon faith is toxic. It's racist, sexist, misogynistic, nepotistic, and creepy as hell. If I can dissuade someone from joining, or convince someone to leave, then hallelujah.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Any scholar of the Old Testament will tell you this. The Lord in the OT was used in reference to two beings. 

Compared to 

Since I believe they created the world together I agree with his comments regarding plurality those words. 

There are two ways god is referred to in the KJV, "the LORD" and God. 

The LORD is when YHWH is in the text. The tetragammatron, or Yahweh, is the true name of Judaism's god. Also referred to as Adonai. 

God is when Elohim is used. Elohim is indeed plural, but **nearly all** actual biblical academics will tell you it is because the ancient Jews believed in a panel of gods. El was one of the gods in charge. Later, the Jews became strict monotheists, and all the different gods were rolled into one. Elohim is plural because of that. 

The Bible, at least the first 5 books, are a hodgepodge of 4 main sources. One source used YWHW, the other used Elohim. 

This is reflected, for example, in the two distinctly different creation stories. It's also possible to tease apart the two different flood narratives. 

Leave preconceived notions at the door, and join us in /r/academicbiblical, where actual scholarly sources can be had, and decisions are based on real-world evidence and not modern doctrine.  </TEXT>

A mirror is just that, duplicated content hosted elsewhere. You can have a video on youtube, for example, mirrored to vimeo or other places. Mirrors are useful, because some people are at work or school, and the firewalls allow some websites through but block others.

Mirrors also hold sites accountable. For example, in /r/exmormon, many people maintain mirrors of the church essays, so if the church changes the essays, there is a record. This is because the mormon church is surprisingly duplicitous, and has no problem pretending that some things in the past never happened, and that the way things are now have always been.

<TEXT> Hello,

Today, when I woke my computer up, my mouse worked just fine, but the keyboard was all fucky. The function buttons worked, as did the 9pad. However, all letter keys went to shortcuts. "S" brought up Cortana, "w" brought up the announcements, etc. One key locked the computer.

I removed the batteries, replaced, turned it off/on, etc.

I found a fix by copy/pasting "run" into Cortana, and running "osk" to get an on-screen keyboard. Typing on the on-screen keyboard, followed by the physical keyboard, fixed the problem.

What the hell happened? How can I prevent this from happening in the future? </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, sorry, that's wholly incorrect. The Church Handbook of Instructions reads: 

A husband and wife who were married outside a temple *may be sealed* **after one full year** *from the time of the civil marriage.* However, this one-year waiting period does not apply to worthy couples in the following cases:

1. The temple in which the couple will be sealed is in a country that requires a civil marriage and does not recognize a marriage in the temple.

2. The couple live in a country where there is not a temple and the laws of the country do not recognize a marriage performed outside the country

3. An unchaperoned couple's travel to a temple will require one or more overnight stops because of distance.

4. The couple could not be married in a temple because one or both had not been a member of the Church for one year at the time of their civil marriage. They may be endowed and sealed any time after both have been members for at least one year.

5. The couple were married in a civil ceremony while awaiting the processing of an application that had already been submitted to the First Presidency for (a) the cancellation of the wife's previous sealing or (b) the husband's sealing clearance. The couple may be sealed any time after they receive notification from the First Presidency that the cancellation or clearance was granted. They must present the letter(s) at the temple in which they will be sealed.

In the first three cases, worthy couples should receive their endowment and be sealed as soon as possible after their civil marriage.

<TEXT> If you have a ring ceremony, the LDS church says the following: 

Exchanging rings is not part of the temple marriage ceremony. However, couples may exchange rings after the ceremony in the room where the ceremony takes place. To avoid confusion with the marriage ceremony, couples should not exchange rings at any other time or place in a temple or on temple grounds. However, after their temple marriage, a couple may exchange rings at locations other than the temple. If such an exchange is made, the circumstances should be consistent with the dignity of their temple marriage. **The exchange should not appear to replicate any part of the marriage ceremony, and the couple should not exchange vows.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello,

I am subscribed to a number of mods. However, recently, the game has been unexpectedly crashing. I'd like to unsubscribe from a few of the mods, until I find the one that is the problem child.

Unfortunately, if I go to Steam Workshop - Your Files - Subscribed Items and click "unsubscribe," when I hit refresh, the mod is still there. Going to the mods page to unsubscribe is equally unsuccessful. I've attempted this via the Steam program, and the in-browser Steam.

Any tips? Am I doing anything wrong?

Thanks for your help!

Edit:

Attempted to unsubscribe the mods via the in-game mod list. Not initially successful in removing the mods from the steam workshop (via steam program or browser). Cleared steam files via the steam instructions [here](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3134-TIAL-4638). The workshop still thinks I'm subscribed to the mods I left, but the in-game mod list thinks I'm subscribed to no mods. The mystery continues. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The prior statistic given was from 1985-2009. During that time, the LDS church's reported membership was 5,920,000-13,824,854.

Using the previous figure of 5 million (*not four million*) was, in actuality, **strengthening** the figure, not watering it down. Further, the previous stats were in the past tense (*gave* $1bn, not *gives* $40 mil/year).

Since you have shifted tenses, and also have a previously unreported statistic (source? unless your grammar was wrong, and you meant "gave"), I decided to use the most recent 2014 membership statistics, or about 15 million members.

I never used a 4 million figure. Indeed, you've pointed out an error, I should have used a figure between 6 and 14 million. Let's split the difference and call it $1bn, for 10 million members, over 25 years.

So, instead of my previous comment of $8.33/member/year, we're left with a paultry $4.00/member/year.

Thanks, /u/cbfw86! You've successfully pointed out that your church is even **worse** in a humanitarian sense than before!!

Listen.  Any way you cut it, it's well below $10/member/year. Assuming an average salary of $15,000/year (children, 3rd world, stay-at-home moms, etc), given a tithing of $1500, the church gives an incredibly paultry amount.

Yes, "only" $1bn. Yes, "only" $10/member/year. Yes, your church sucks in regards to charitable giving.

Pathetic. Absolutely pathetic. Your church can't even be consistent to it's teachings. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While brother Joseph was referring to the provinces of God, I was led to reflect that there is no act, no principle, no power belonging to the Deity that is purely philosophical. The birth of the Saviour was as natural as are the births of our children; it was the result of natural action. He partook of flesh and blood  was begotten of his Father, as we were of our fathers.

- Prophet Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses, v. 8, p. 115

... I believe the Father came down from heaven, as the apostles said he did, and begat the Saviour of the world; for he is the ONLY-begotten of the Father, which could not be if the Father did not actually beget him in person.... I believe the Father came down in His tabernacle and begat Jesus Christ.

- Prophet Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses, v. 1, p. 238

... In relation to the way in which I look upon the works of God and his creatures, I will say that I was naturally begotten; so was my father, and also my Saviour Jesus Christ. According to the Scriptures, he is the first begotten of his father in the flesh, and there was noting unnatural about it.

- Apostle Heber C. Kimball, Journal of Discourses, v. 8, p. 211

God, the Father of our spirits, became the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ according to the flesh.... The fleshy body of Jesus required a Mother as well as a Father. Therefore, the Father and Mother of Jesus, according to the flesh, must have been associated together in the capacity of Husband and Wife; hence the Virgin Mary must have, for the time being, the lawful wife of God the Father.... He had a lawful right to overshadow the Virgin Mary in the capacity of a husband, and beget a Son, although she was espoused to another; for the law which He gave to govern men and women, was not intended to govern Himself, or to prescribe rules for his own conduct.

- Apostle Orson Pratt, The Seer, p. 158

Now, we are told in scriptures that Jesus Christ is the only begotten Son of God in the flesh. Well, now for the benefit of the older ones, how are children begotten? I answer just as Jesus Christ was begotten of the flesh... Jesus is the only person who had our Heavenly Father as the father of his body.

- Prophet Joseph F. Smith, Family Home Evening Manual, pp. 125, 126, 1972

Christ was Begotten by an immortal Father in the same way that mortal men are begotten by mortal fathers.

- Apostle Bruce R. McConkie, Mormon Doctrine, p. 547, 1966

And Christ was born into the world as the literal Son of this Holy Being; he was born in the same personal, real, and literal sense that any mortal son is born to a mortal father. There is nothing figurative about his paternity; he was begotten, conceived and born in the normal and natural course of events, for he is the Son of God, and that designation means what it says.

- Apostle Bruce R. McConkie, Mormon Doctrine, p. 792, 1966

As far as this life is concerned, [Jesus] was born of Mary and of Elohim; he came here as an offspring of that Holy Man who is literally our Father in heaven. He was born in mortality in the literal and full sense as the Son of God. He is the Son of his father in the same sense that all morals are the sons and daughters of their fathers.

- Apostle Bruce R. McConkie, Mortal Messiah, v. 1, p. 330

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints proclaims that Jesus Christ is the Son of God in the most literal sense. The body in which He performed His mission in the flesh was sired by that some Holy Being we worship as God, our Eternal Father. Jesus was not the son of Joseph, nor was He begotten by the Holy Ghost.

- Prophet Ezra Taft Benson, The Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson, p. 7

Thus, God the Father became the literal father of Jesus Christ. Jesus was born of a mortal mother and an immortal father.

- Gospel Principles, p. 57, 1988

[Jesus Christ] was willing to make payment because of his great love for mankind, and he was able to make payment because he lived a sinless life and because he was actually, literally, biologically the Son of God in the flesh.

- Messages for Exaltation, For the Sunday Schools of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Gospel Doctrine Class, pp. 378-379, 1967

Maybe the mormons you interact with don't, or they just don't want to talk about it with you.

However, let me assure you, there's a whole bunch of Mormons in Utah who fully believe that Jesus was conceived physically. I know a few bishops, a stake president, and at least two patriarchs who ascribe to the idea. Moreover, they have multiple statements from Prophets and Apostles to back them up.

Your belief that Jesus wasn't conceived through physical sex is a nonsensical misnomer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe the sin was Lot offering to let his two virgin daughters get gang-raped?

I don't know why Sodom and Gomorrah are held as this grave warning. They damn Christianity much more than they ever do homosexuals. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The only mention of homosexual marriage occurs just prior to the flood of Noah and is a direct cause of that flood.

I don't know, modern Christians/the LDS church/conservatives/the GOP seem to fill the following:

Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy.

<TEXT> But, according to Packer,

It is not unusual to have a missionary say, How can I bear testimony until I get one? How can I testify that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that the gospel is true? If I do not have such a testimony, would that not be dishonest?

Oh, if I could teach you this one principle: a testimony is to be found in the bearing of it!

So, maybe she should continue being counterfeit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That build seems pretty okay, but I'm not sure if I need/want overclocking (I'm not sure how to do it).

One of my big problems is that I have a general idea of what each part *does*, I just don't know how they'll act together. For example, would your build play better (FPS or whatever) compared to an xbox one?

For the video card, am I right in assuming that more GB is better than less? Would this card (http://pcpartpicker.com/part/sapphire-video-card-100363vx3l?ref=mrob) be better? </TEXT>

The primary way I'll play games is with the xbox controller, the wireless kb/mouse is for lazy internet browsing. Everything will be done from my couch, as I don't have room for a desk, but already have a couch/TV/etc.

How does your current build handle recent game titles? Is your current build roughly equivalent to mine? </TEXT>

I'm planning on using a 42" HDTV LED Vizio, 120 hz, as a monitor, in conjunction with a wireless mouse, keyboard, and wired xbox 360 controller.

This build was automatically pushed out by the choosemyPC build generator. Building computers is new, and completely foreign. Does anything seem *not right*? Anything obvious that could be easily upgraded?

Thanks for your help! </TEXT>
