<TITLE> Reworking Capture the Flag </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-15 21:15:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Capture the Flag has long been a favorite game mode of mine, so I was super excited when Blizzard announced it to OW. I remember spending hundreds of hours in Halo playing CTF.

It's an understatement saying that I was disappointed when I played it.

It's a super underdeveloped game mode if a legit tactic is "Sit by your own flag and wait for the other team to arrive."

Having only your home flag and your away flag doesn't create any dynamic game play. But there's a super simple solution. Every map should have a neutral flag in the middle. That forces players not only to protect their own flag, but it also makes them chase the neutral flag. In that way, you can't have players camping by their own flag, and you get a more dynamic game play which also forces the teams to make more strategic choices. </TEXT>

Later I've been watching the subreddit a bit, but can't get my head around if I should buy it or not.

I loved both SSX Tricky and The Skate series (I've heard that it's been slightly compared to a "skate but on snow") so I wonder, will I like this? Is it just an open world snowboarding/skiing simulator? Is there a goal to it? Is there unlockables or is everything there for you right from the getgo? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The swedish postal system. It's owned by the Swedish and the Danish government but acts like a private company.

There's more complaints made against them than I've ever seen against another company before. They lose packages and mail ALL the time. Letters take months to arrive even if the sender has paid extra to get it delivered on a specific date. They leave orders out on the street if they've arrived outside of the agreed delivery time.

I came to my old workplace one day to see a package containing a machine worth around $2000 standing outside on the pavement with a note saying "Hope it's ok that I left the box here."

They sometimes refuse to deliver mail to certain houses because "the lighting isn't enough and the mailboxes are too hard to open. They could cause injuries to our delivery people" which is complete bullshit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course you technically CAN. The thing is - you can't expect people to pay for it. If the "service" has been free before, people won't pay for it just out of the blue like that. That's not how it works.

For example - if water is free for everyone and suddenly one company wants you to pay for it, because they feel like it's the right thing, people will get pissy and turn their backs to it. Because that's how it works.

You do you, boo. But don't complain when people won't take you serious. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Lunch for office space employee? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just started working as an administrator which means I sit around looking at a computer all day long and not moving around much. I also drink a bit too much coffee.

I've noted that I've started to gain a few pounds as well and want to be able to eat as healthy as possible. I'm getting a gym card as soon as I'm getting my first paycheck, though.

But yeah, I'm looking for tasty and nutritious lunches that can also be microwaved if needed.

I eat everything, I'm not allergic to anything (but we have a ban on nuts at the office because of airborne nut allergy) and I don't mind eating the same thing for a few days. Lunch for me isn't really about having a meal that's meant to be enjoyed. I just want something that tastes good and gives me energy.

I eat meat, but trying to cut down on it, so vegetarian and vegan is also welcome.

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My dad died in 2010 when I was 17.

"Not much" of a loss, if you ask me, really. It hurts of course, but it's "better" that it was him and not my mother. He was an alcoholic who couldn't keep his temper. He never touched or hurt any of his three children, but we fought and argued almost daily. When I say "we", I mean he got angry over every little thing and his way of arguing was "The one who shouts the loudest is correct." He drank all day long, smoked at least a pack and a half of cigarettes each day and god knows how he managed to pay the bills. I can't remember him having a legit job for years. Other people's kids were more important than his own. Me and my sister studied music in high school and my sister told me that he would always show up at her friends shows, but never to hers. He never showed up to any of mine either. 

I don't have any memories of him sober, actually. My sister told me about him being sober when we were going to the museum once. Until we reached the museum that also had a bar next to it, which is where he started.

My stepdad, on the other hand, is a great man. Rather weird and odd, but still a fantastic man. I realized after a few years that he has some kind of "mental blockage" in which he doesn't understand some social codes and things like that. He's very honest, in both a good and bad way, but he doesn't always know when it's appropriate to say something and when to just shut up. It's not like he's full on "Oh and btw, you're dog died.". He knows when to not speak about certain things, but often he's kind of "Well, it's my opinion, it's what I think. People don't have to care about it." without thinking about how other people feel.

But, as said, he's a great man. He's taught me everything I know. He took me fishing, we went and practiced archery together. We did everything a boy "is supposed to do" with his father. He's a kind man who's taught me a lot of things when it comes to life and how to "be a man". I love him to death. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One example is the IBP scandal. For those not knowing, [here's](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/counterstrike/North_American_match_fixing_scandal) a summary of it. In short words they got banned for match fixing.

Someone already mentioned the Fnatic - NiP game. Fnatic later came out with an apology about it.

s1mple has often been seen as an e-sport villain due to his horrible attitude towards other players. When he joined Hiko in Liquid, he got knocked down a couple of pins though and matured a lot.

Richard Lewis is always going to be a "villain" in my eyes, even though he's not a player. There's been quite a few controvercies around him due to his behavior. Both physical assault on a player backstage (Queue the "Well, that player shouldn't have been backstage anyway!!!" argument) as well as bullying and verbally assaulting other caster while live on air.

Also the polish crowd during Katowice. They weren't exactly "villains" since it only lasted one tournament, but they booed fnatic after they beat VP. It wasn't until Taz came out and told them not be jerks that they stopped.

I can probably come up with more later.

Also - the CS:GO and LoL community overall. They are the biggest villains overall. Bunch of sexist and racist homophobes high on monster and doritos. </TEXT>

When we didn't have packages that fit correctly, we sometimes had to put things in an a lot bigger package, just so we could get it sent away.

But then again, no filling seems a tad too weird. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am a complete noob when it comes to mechanical keyboards and I'm looking for something to use both for gaming and for typing. I would say the most important part is the typing.

I have no clue about anything when it comes to different switches. The only experience I have is with Cherry MX Black and I feel that they are bit too "soggy" (if you catch my drift) to type longer text posts with.

I found the ANNE PRO, but I want something with the numpad as well, since I use it a lot when I work. I liked the ANNE PRO a lot because of the price, so I'd be glad to have something in the cheaper range. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know how, but I've always had a knack for giving oral sex to a female. I think it might be because I never really associated with pornos. I've never seen it as something that you had to be forced to do, but instead something I enjoyed to do. In comparison to a lot of guys who brag about how much they love eating pussy and then backs off as soon as they are asked to do it.

My best recommendation would probably be something in the line of what /u/zyzzyva82 mentions. There is some really good literature out there.

Have you tried talking to your S/O outside of the bed about it? It might feel awkward, but I think it's something you both could benefit from. Him talking about "his idea" of giving, and you telling him what he should/could do better etc.

I hope it turns out good for you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was born in '92, so I am kinda in the middle of what people call the millennial generation. The way I see it is that people my age and younger are both extremely self centered and egoistic. Of course not everyone, but a large chunk that I see on a daily basis act both like they are the center of the universe and like other people don't matter.

One thing I've noticed about people around my age (+-2/3 years) is that they define themselves not on who or what they are, but what a doctor tells them. People my age demand that other people change according to them instead of trying to cooperate with the world in a way where both work together.

I don't know how many times I've got the argument "I have *insert mental illness here*, so I am allowed to act like this.". It's not "Just so you know, I have this mental illness in where I can go into fits of rage, or fits of sadness, and I can't really control it, but I want you to know.". I have had friends telling me that I am a bad person because I can't cope with them being complete assholes. "You know that this is how I act, I can't control it."

I am myself diagnosed with both severe depression, anxiety and panic attacks. I get panic attacks almost on a daily basis. I don't blame my actions on them. I don't tell people that things I've done during those moments were correct and brush it off with "I'm sick." The world doesn't work that way, no matter how much you want it to.

A second thing that really grinds my gears is that some kind of "post ironic" movement has sprouted. I call it "post ironic" because the people in that category act in a way that I would do when I was maybe 13 or 14 on the internet. When being edgy and "ironic/sarcastic". It's the "I don't care what people think about it, it's just the internet. I don't care if I hurt someone.". The difference is that these people aren't 13. They are 20+ and have started acting like this. "What do you mean people take death threats seriously? It's just the internet." I've found two things that these people often have in common:

* Intentionally spelling like half of their keys on the keyboard are missing

* Listening to Yung Lean and similar artists.

I'm not bashing YL, for the bashing of it (which I easily could do otherwise, because I despise that kid), but it's just a thing I've found them to have in common. If you look at some interviews with YL, he really comes out as an asshole. I remember one interview where the journalist said "I heard some stuff that you could be kinda rowdy and annoying before shows."

His reply was "Haha, yeah. One time when we were gigging in Berlin, we annoyed the sound tech so much that he threw an ash tray after us. That was hilarious."

The third, and maybe the most controversial, thing is - they are lazy. And as with my first point, it's not everyone. But I've never seen so many people from a single generation that demands so much without wanting to give or do something back. 

I was recently unemployed and the "activity" (as they call it) was filled to the brim with people my age who didn't want to start at the bottom or work with something that wasn't top. Many of they, when asked "What do you want to work with?" often said "I don't know." and when asked "Well, would you consider working with this?" the reply was, in nine out of ten cases, "No, it's boring.". A lot of them wanted jobs, but they didn't want an education or start from the bottom. It's never their own fault when things go wrong. It's always someone elses. You're not supposed to work for your earning, you're supposed to be served it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, so number three is a lie. I love coffee. It's one of my passions.

Explanations:

1. I studied music in high school and during first and second year, choir was mandatory. I had a habit of not eating breakfast, but instead go through the days with coffee and sodas. Just before our first year ended, we had a school concert where the choir performed. I, being a second bass (the lowest range), was placed standing on a chair in the back row. Before the concert, I was feeling a bit queasy, but I shrugged it off since I always feel that way before a concert. During the concert, I kept getting more and more queasy and started cold sweats. At that point I thought "Fuck if, our dirigent can get pissed, I just have to explain to him afterwards. I have to sit down." The second I think that, I black out. I woke up with the two guys next to me holding me in one arm each. At least I wasn't the only one who passed out that day!

2. During the first semester of my last year in elementary school, the national television broadcasting company had the idea of switching out all of regular teachers for "super teachers" and film that for half a year.

 The backstory is that my school was one of the worst schools in the country when it comes to students grades. I think about 43% of the students from the classes two years prior to us got into high school. So they came up with this pitch. They probably thought that since the two other classes were that bad, the next is probably the same. And they weren't completely wrong. So they switched out all the teachers and put in "super teachers".

 They recorded practially every single day of school, all classes, for six months before airing it on national TV. In the end, the show was awarded with a trophy for best documentary series.

List three things about yourself. Two things that are true and one that is a lie. It is then our job to guess which one is false.

And I guess that I, as OP, should start.

* In high school, I passed out during a show with our school choir and knocked over two people standing in front of me.

* I frequently starred in an award winning TV show.

<TEXT> I'm 6'4"/193cm and I love t-shirts. My biggest problem when buying t-shirts is that they're either fitted perfectly around my body, but too short, or they are long enough, but then baggy.

I feel comfortable with more slim t-shirts but I only have two or three that actually fit both around the body and with my height.

Are there any specific where one can order shirts that fit with my body type?

Also, what goes good with t-shirts? Especially the slim fitted. I usually wear jeans and a belt together with a hoodie and a flat cap.

Pictures can be provided if needed. </TEXT>

<TITLE> PS4 controllers refusing to link with anything other than the first console? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-04 22:45:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I work as an administrator at our local video game club and today it was my duty to see if our consoles's were working properly. Because of a few reasons, we do not have the consoles rigged up permanently atm, so I had to check so everything was alright before sending them of to a convention for the week.

When testing the first console, everything went great. But when trying to test the second and third console, the controllers refused to connect with the consoles. 

No matter what I did, they wouldn't connect to it. Plugging them in and pressing the PS button didn't work, resetting them with the button on the bottom did nothing, and when trying pressing down Share and PS button it did nothing except making it flash rapidly. I tried with different cables in case there was something wonky with the cable I used, but it worked fine. 

When reconnecting the first PS4 to the HDMI and power (I only had one console plugged in at the same time, trying to make it easier to connect one controller to all of them one at a time), the controllers connected to the console without a problem.

What have I done wrong and what should I do? </TEXT>

<TEXT> My first thing was that I enjoyed scratching, but I tried biting pretty early as well. Mostly because one of my ticks is to bite on things. Basically anything I could get my hands on, I would put it in my mouth.

Got too much to carry and still have something small, for example keys? Put it between your teeth!

After that biting has become one of my main things.

I was curious to strangulation as well and I realized that it was the thing that I really loved.

One thing that I found out by random was with my ex. She was having a lot of anxiety over school and when we went to sleep she started bawling her eyes out. That gave me a massive erection, which really wasn't the reaction I had expected from myself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever press down on the windpipe. 

When you do that, you cut off the oxygen to the lungs, which not only hurts like a bitch (try pressing your finger against your own throat) and can actually hurt the person permanently, but it puts the body in a kind of panic mode as well. When the lungs aren't fed oxygen they will do everything they can to get more. That is why you can't hold your breath until you're blue, because the body forces you to breathe in. That is also why it hurts like a bitch when inhaling water. The body forces you to inhale and the water goes into your lungs.

What you want to do is cut off the blood that goes to the brain by putting pressure on the external carotid arteries which are the main arteries that delivers blood to the brain. That way you're cutting of the oxygen filled blood going to the brain, without putting the body into panic mode. You're more putting it in... sleep mode. If one would like to put it that way. Because as soon as you let go and the brain gets blood again, it starts up again and the person wakes up.

But you also have to remember to be very careful when doing this, as lack of oxygen to the brain can also damage the brain when exposed to it for too long. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Two occasions.

Being 14/15 and having my first girlfriend. At this time, I was also starting to experiencing my first real panic attacks. At one time, during an attack, I picked up my phone and dumped her. That's dick move number one. 

 She first said that she didn't want to have contact with me, but after a while she unblocked me on msn (good old times) and we started chatting again. After a week or so, she blocked me again, telling me that she didn't want to have any contact with me.

Me, being 15 years old and an idiot thinks "Oh, she just can't let it go. Why can't we just be friends?" so from time to time, I try shooting her a text. If I've passed her on the street or something. I kept doing this for quite a while, with the same mantra in my head. "She can't let it go. She can't let it go. She can't let it go."

It wasn't until the day I added her on facebook and she sent me a message saying "*You're really not giving up?*" that I realized. I started with replying "*Haha, you're the one who can't let it all go and become friends.*" and got a reply saying that she doesn't want to be my friend ever again and that I was a complete dick. She couldn't understand how thick my head was ([Mandatory](http://i.imgur.com/2H9nylb.png) meme) or how I couldn't see it all. It was at that moment I realized "Holy shit. She's not the one with problems letting go. I am."

 I ended the conversation with telling her all of this. That I never realized what a jackass I am and how I never understood that I was the one who couldn't let go. The last thing I wrote was that I was sorry and that I will never try and contact her again.

Second occassion!

A few years back, me and a few friends were visiting a music festival, and as everyone who's ever been to a larger music festival knows - losing each other is a bit too easy. Especially when the festival's major crowd is described as 6'+, blond hair and beard.

Either way! We bumped in to some acquaintances who in the end wouldn't leave us alone. Especially one girl who was super annoying. She was also having a massive turn on for one of my friends. And he did not have the same... feelings for her. After a while, we did our best to try and lose her in the crowd. Like deliberately walking in different directions away from each other and then meeting up at a predetermined spot. The problem was - no matter what we did, she would always find one of us.

Eventually we got rid of her. We got the brilliant idea of meeting up at the camping spot. The place where her ticket didn't let her enter.

Fast forward a few years and me and a few friends were sitting at  a bar. We were six or seven people and we were talking about two acquaintances we had bumped into during the evening (one of them being this chick) and I start telling this story about how annoying and bothering she was. I go on for a good five minutes on how I really didn't like her until one of the guys says "*Uhm... you know that's his girlfriend, right?*" and points to the guy sitting almost next to me.

The hole I wanted to drop down into could not be big enough.

The weird part is that he took it extremely well. He just said "*Well, you can't like everyone*" and didn't hold any grudges against me when I met him a few months later.

Talking to him about it a few years later, he said that he wasn't mad at me and that he also realized what a twat she was just some months after that.

One thing is for certain. SHE was told what I had said, because she would never try to say hi to me again, ever. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My experience with the Siberia 800/H Wireless </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-20 23:49:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For those not knowing - before making the Siberia 800 a part of the Siberia family, it was named H Wireless.

I'm going to make the introduction and story short. I had some major complaints regarding a (now discontinued) model of headphones and the service I had received from SteelSeries and after posting here about what happened I was given a pair of H Wireless as compensation. I've had them for about a year and a half now.

I want to share my experience with the headphones.

First, the positive things.

* The ear cup size is fantastic. They are big enough to cover my ears and my ears don't hurt after a few hours of use.

* The sound quality is fantastic. The surround sound is amazing, even on wireless.

* The foam in the headband/headrest (what do I call it?) is still respondent, minus the part of the foam that is in 100% contact with the top of my head at all times. It's still soft though!

* The size of the headphones itself is a big plus. Since they are wider than usual, they don't press as much against my big head, in comparison to other headphones.

* The mic quality is also fantastic. It's crisp, clean and nice!

* It feels sturdy and heavy when holding them in your hand, but not heavy on the head.

And also, the bad parts.

* The transmitter is unresponsive. When using the scrolling wheel on the headphones, you never know if it's going to scroll down three times or one time when scrolling through three "clicks" on the wheel.

* The transmitter doesn't load the batteries as intended. It doesn't even show the correct energy volume of the batteries. It can say that a completely drained battery is fully charged.

* I have to put the batteries in at a certain angle for the transmitter to even recognize them being there. If I just press it in and down until it stops on the "bottom", the transmitter won't recognize it. Or it will say that the drained battery is full. Or flicker between charging, fully charged, charging fully charged etc etc.

* About a third of the time, the headphones won't recognize the batteries either. Nothing happens when I put a new battery in and try to turn the headphones on. My McGyver solution has come down to either blow air onto the battery socket and the battery; and if that doesn't work, put the battery into the charger for a "kick", or something.

All of the battery related things have been like this from the day I received them.

* The mute button has stopped working. The mic shines red, but it keeps transmitting. Don't know how long it's been going on since only one person told it to me about a month back.

* I haven't had problems before with the reach of the headphones to the transmitter. Until about two or three months ago where it wouldn't pick up my microphone, but I could hear what other people said. As soon as I came three meters or further away, the mic stopped working.

* Two small things. When tilting my head, I can hear something rattle in the right ear piece. Like something small is loose. The plastic on the microphone has cracked in one place as well, but I don't mind that.

So, this is my experience with the Siberia 800. Great sound, great fitting ear cups, great on the head and great mic quality. Unfortunately there's quite a few things that brings it down for me. </TEXT>

I've always lacked confidence in myself and my looks. I've shifted in weight through my whole life. From being rather overweight as a child to being underweight as a teenager.

Right now I'm at a more "stable" weight, but I struggle with both eating habits, body image and other stuff.

I've also never liked my smile.

So, what do you say? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course I play the game because it's fun in the beginning, otherwise I wouldn't play it.

Maybe I phrased myself wrong, but as I mention it is pointed more towards people who try to climb higher and higher in ranks (or have made it to higher ranks) without knowing the basic elements of the game. That is a reason I stopped playing CS:GO. I wasn't good enough to play with the people I played with. And I lost a alot. It's not fun losing over and over again.

Of course it's more important to have fun, but I can't see how things continue to be fun if you don't improve yourself. For example - how many would continue to play guitar if they only knew one chord? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I came for some tips and tricks and realized I already do most of these things. But thanks for some small things!

I started playing D.Va because I realized how fun it was to harass and annoy the other team. I use this a lot for my own advantage. Especially on maps such as Eichenwalde and Volskaya where the boosters can be used as a flanking mechanic. I would say that it's maybe one in every 20 games or so on those maps where they actually think about people flanking them that way. Both in QP and Comp (Currently at around 2700 SR).

I also use my ult as a way of keeping players off the point. </TEXT>

It's been numerous updates and we still have this. It's extremely annoying to be on the ground, shooting at a moving target and then suddenly having the screen go black. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a man who grew up about the same time as the internet, I've learnt to take everything with a rather large pinch of salt. I've had death threats, threats saying that I should kill myself etc etc (I used to be head mod of a sub with 50k+ subs and when FPH got shut down we got brigaded, but that's a completely different story), so it's something I'm "used to".

But one guy took it one step too far and I got super uncomfortable. I contacted the owner of the website who told me that he would help me with everything that I need. After that I phoned the none emergency 911 number and told the lady on the phone that I wanted to report someone threatening me on the internet. She sounded like she was around my age and was understanding. She took down all the notes and messages that I gave her together with the name and phone number of the website owner. 

A few weeks pass and I get a letter in the mail from the police telling me that the case has been dropped because they didn't see any value in continuing it.
I phone the number on the papers and get to speak with the officer in charge of the case. 

This was a woman, in around her 40-50's who had NO clue what she was talking about.

"You know you can't track people with IP addresses, right?"

"Uh, yes you can."

"Yeah, but not the way you think."

"You can track down a person to the specific computer using their IP address."

"Yeah... maybe. But it's not as easy as you think."

"....yes it is."

"Yeah. But do you really think he would admit to threatening someone over the internet? He could say that someone else has been using his account and internet! We can't prove that he did it."

"Do you think he'd admit to threatening me in real life if you that would've happend as well?"

"No... probably not. But still, there's no value in continuing this. But I do see here that someone has actually taken up the case again..."

So apparently someone higher up had taken up the case again. Great, right?! No. He took it up just to dismiss it again, saying that there wasn't enough evidence to support it. That I found out a few days later when a new letter arrived in the mail. To make things even better he went on vacation the day after, so I had to wait another month before I could speak to him.

He told me that they hadn't even contacted the website owner who would provide them with every detail they needed. They didn't deem it "necessary". </TEXT>

Fr de som inte vet s r Mllevngstorget "mecca" fr MFF-supporters. Det r drifrn man tgar till stora matcher, det r dr folk tar sin "infr matchen"-l och det r dr man tittar p matchen om man inte str p lktaren.

S att vlja att slppa av tv busslaster med Hammarbyare var ett vldigt dumt val. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I started out with the SNES when I was about seven years old, I think. After that I basically only played on consoles up to about two years ago.

SNES, SEGA Megadrive, PS1, PS2, PS3, Xbox and 360. Then I started playing PC and about half a year ago I upgraded myself to a real gaming PC.

From the beginning I mostly played Adventure Games. I was really bad at shooting, so that wasn't really an option. Later on I played Rock Band (Drumming) A LOT. I used to be top 200 in the world for a while.

I remember my first games being Krusty's Fun House (which was insanely difficult for a seven year old) to the SNES, Crash Bandicoot 2 for the PS1, Whacked! (which, despite the really low scores was funny as hell) for the original xbox, CoD World At War for the 360 and Heavy Rain for the PS3.

I've also realized how much I've shifted in the games I played. I played adventure and sports games for the most part. I also played a lot of RPG's when I got my first computer, but I never really liked WoW. 

For a few years I played a lot of Civ V as well (and I'm really looking forward to buying VI!). But today I've gone back a lot to adventure games again. A lot of story driven and linear games instead of open world games. (says the guy who's munching through No Man's Sky right now....). But I realized that it's actually really nice to play a single player story driven game where you don't HAVE to be creative and build stuff on your own. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It kinda depends on what kind of hardcore shows you go to.

Some of the old school hardcore shows would involve fighting. Even early SlipKnoT shows would involve people bringing baseball bats and other weapons to beat each other up.

Or just look att G.G Allin shows, where he himself participated.

Most of the kids in the gif are probably the type of kids who want to mosh on their own, flailing their arms around, not caring if other people get hit, but would actually never participate in a "real" moshpit where pushing and shoving is required. </TEXT>

The tuition is $4.300 (they apparently pay half, so $8.600 for the full price) for  "50 Personal Instruction Lessons" and "More than 300 Hours of Learning". That's quite a lot of money.

And when it does show servers, I can't connect to them. It just says that it can't connect.

Another thing that kinda bummed me out as well is that I found a server that I played around on, but it won't show up in my server history. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The funny thing is that Apple isn't the first company to do this. I think HTC had one or two phones where they skipped the 3,5 jack and nobody batted an eye. But as soon as Apple does something, people go apeshit.

For example, when Apple took away flash support people went "HOLY SHIT. YOU CAN'T DO THAT", and then just a couple of months later, most major companies went "Oh, right, Flash sucks. We use HTML5 instead now." 

To be honest, the 3,5 jack is an outdated technology. It's just convenient to use it. If one of the companies that produce phones with Android would choose to remove the 3,5 jack, I'm pretty sure nobody would really care. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When getting the blueprints for the Jetpack Booster Sigma, I thought that I might build them since I had what I needed.

I did and a few minutes later this little box showed up. 

I thought to myself "Ok, well maybe it didn't register that I crafted it before and went a loop around itself.".

But it won't go away, no matter what I do. I can craft 10 Carite Sheets and craft the mod, but nothing happens. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As much as I agree with what Bill Sherrill, I don't agree with the "it's anti capitalistic". The reason why it still is as it is, is because of gigantic companies like AB InBev that has the huge amount of money that they can spend on making sure that they are the ones making the most money, not the little ones. Anti entrepreneur, yes. Anti capitalist? No, not really.

<TEXT> Well, to be honest - more than two thirds of adult american are considered overweight to obese, a third of the adult american population is considered obese and one in every 20 adult person in america is considered "extremely obese". When talking about children one in every three kid is considered overweight and one in every six is considered obese. So assuming that americans are fat isn't really "uneducated".

But then again, this is, as you pointed out, not an average body. It's hot as hell.

<TEXT> I worked at a store that sold espresso machines, spare parts, accessories for the machines and so on. It's a small store with a loyal group of customers, so I recognize our regulars.

One day, an old man walks into the store. I say hello and ask if I can help him.


Customer: "Yes! I am looking for a part for my machine!"

Me: "Alright! What machine is it?"

C: "It's a **brand** and I need a **part**

M: "Hmm, I don't think we have any of those parts. Let me check.

I check the cupboards behind the counter and find nothing.

M: "Let me just ask my manager."

I go back, ask him about and get the answer that we do not sell them anymore.

M: "I'm sorry, sir, but we don't sell those anymore."

C: "What do you mean 'you don't sell them anymore'?"

M: "Well, it means we don't sell them anymore. We can order the spare part for you if you want, but we don't have it in stock."

C: "That can't be possible! You've always had it in stock! I but it here all the time!"

M: "When was the last time you bought it, sir?"

C: "Three years ago!" </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, while playing some matches today and as usual people using Reaper will use Wraith Form as soon as they are in danger. That's understandable. I use it too on the rare occasions where I use him.

The problem I have with it is that even though he can't take damage, he can still be healed by Mercy, for example. He can't shoot, he can't take damage and he can go through enemies. Isn't giving him the ability to be healed at the same time a bit overkill? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I realized this while browsing /r/HighQualityGifs. The gifs there load quick and easy without any hacking or hickups in the playup, but trying to browse a regular sub like /r/aww or anything like that, the gif can take ages to load even though the quality is that of a potato.

Shouldn't it be in the reverse order? The high quality gifs that are heavy should take ages to load and buffer while playing and the low quality ones should load smoothly? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wouldn't say that he was actually a "silent protagonist" since you continuously have verbal interactions with other characters. A silent protagonist in my opinion is Gordon Freeman, who don't actually talk. In FO3 and FONV, you still talk to people. I also enjoy the skill system in FO4 as well.

Well, then we just don't agree on those things, and that's fine.

EDIT: Also, what I was talking about wasn't the fact that the protagonist is speaking or not. I pointed towards that they have switched the sentence box so that you can't read the dialogue before you use it. In that way, if you want to chuckle at his sarcastic remarks, you have to choose to say it, not just read it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly. In short words, mall cops. They are put on duty where security needs to be checked, but places that are still low threats. Such as petty thefts in malls, subway stations where fights can break out etc etc. They don't have the same full authority as an LEO, but are allowed to hold people down until police arrives.

If I'm not mistaken, there's two types of CSO's here in Sweden. The ones that can handcuff you and those who can't. Not sure about it since I'm not a part of it. </TEXT>

I don't have any good idea on how to continue and then I found 23andMe. The problem is that it's rather pricy for me. Living at home, recently unemployed and no higher education.

If someone would have one, or felt like sending one, that would mean the world to me.

**Ralf** - alla som ngonsin har skejtat i stan vet vem Ralf r. Mrkhyad och stor som en mindre ladugrd. Gr inte att missa honom. 

**Darwin** - Ingen aning om vad han egentligen heter, men vi kan kalla honom Darwin. Mrkhyad snubbe som alltid gr kldd i reflexvst. Skelar t alla hll och kanter och pratar om Darwin hela tiden. Trodde han hade kolat rtt lnge, tills jag sg honom p stan i veckan. 

Sen har vi han som alltid sger **Jag tycker inte om att tigga** samtidigt som han ska ta i hand och bertta om att han r frn Sydamerika, att han inte tycker om att tigga men att han behver ngra kronor. 

Kan skert komma p nnu fler om jag bara tnker till. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Best shaving kit for sensitive skin? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-28 16:51:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My genes won't allow me to grow a full beard, so I still look like I'm 14 years old after a week or two. So I try to keep a clean face by shaving at least twice a week.

My problem is that I have rather sensitive skin. I use Gillette Fusion (I think. The one with the blue strip) and their shaving cream for sensitive skin, but I still get sore skin after using it.

I usually shave either during a shower or directly afterwards to keep my skin as warm and moist as possible to prevent any problem. If I rub my hand against my 5 o'clock shadow (or as in my case - the day after shadow) my skin is really sore.

So, my question is - what would you guys recommend for me? Is it worth buying a more expensive kit instead of Gillette? Is there any after shave that you can recommend for sensitive skin as well? </TEXT>

Then, for me, it kinda goes hand in hand since I come from a family that always have been very interested in both food and drinks, so I've had the opportunity to try a rather large range of whiskeys.

But then again, people have different taste in different things! I prefer beer! </TEXT>

<TEXT> As the title says, what things that people go crazy over do you not care about? Maybe you don't see the point, or you just don't get the phenomenon?

As OP I'll start:

1. Game of Thrones. I really don't get it. I just don't. I found it rather boring and mundane. But I get the pleasure of not being afraid of monday spoilers.

2. The Walking Dead. I watched the first season and din't think much of it. Not bad, but not very interesting either. 

3. Swedish rapper Silvana Imam. She's being raised to the skies for her music and for being some kind of feminist icon. I... I just don't care about her. I don't see anything that makes her special or how she stands out.

So, what things do you guys not really care about? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've actually never had anyone who's been sick of under cooked ground beef. And we even have a dish here in Sweden called rbiff (literally raw beef) which is a plate of raw ground beef and condiments.

This looks overdone because of the intense brown color. It looks extremely dry. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a beer snob, I've never heard anyone say most of these things.

About nr 5 - "Who ranks beer?". I don't know. Who ranks food? Who ranks wine? Who ranks movies? You tell me.

Nr 7 - some beer, that isn't Bud or Corona or anything like that, tastes better at room temperature. Why? Because some things taste better at certain degrees.

Anr nr 8 - obviously the person writing the article has never drank or eaten anything that feels different from water and bread. </TEXT>

When someone on my friends lists starts playing a game, the notification pops up and I press it - the chat opens.

I feel like it should either be switched around or both should open the chat. </TEXT>

I can ignore steel and m0e since... well, more toxic players is hard to find on the NA scene, but everyone else? As I see it they are mostly just getting completely trashed by him.

<TITLE> Christmas coffee? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Do you, my fellow baristas, sell special "christmas coffee"? If yes, what do you think about them?

We have three different kinds in our shop at the moment. Two of them are just regular beans that are roasted to be released around the holiday with a special label on it and the third one has flavors added to it.

Thank god the last one comes pre ground in the bags. It's flavored with cardamom, cinnamon and orange. I find it horrendous to drink, but people seem to like it.

So, what about you guys? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So about two months back I went to the Czech Republic for a business trip and at one of the places we had lunch at, we were served a type of bread that was fantastic. It was savory and had small pieces of meat (I think ground meat, actually) in it. 

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/8AKnwen.jpg) is a picture. Does anybody have an idea on what it is and can help me find a recipe for it? </TEXT>

I looked on the forums and saw that they had a repair tool for it. Tried using that one and got [this](https://i.gyazo.com/4abb8753c791696520fdafe56fee8484.png).

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, at the tea and coffee shop I work at, we get maybe one or two calls a day from people who have ordered stuff and haven't received it yet. In nine out of ten cases it is quickly solved by telling them that we don't have what they ordered in stock at the moment. But not this time.

*Me*: Welcome to *company name* it's subject1410.

Customer on the phone: Hi! I ordered a grinder from you a while back and haven't received it yet. I was just wondering when it's going to arrive.

*Me*: Alright, alright, let's see what we can do here. 

Him: Yeah, because I ordered it two years ago.

*Me*: ...excusemewhat?

Him: Yeah.

*Me*: Tw... two years ago?

Him: Yes. And I haven't received it yet.

*Me*: Uhm.... Ok. Let me write down your name and number and I'll see what I can do.

I stood there with the phone in my hand for a few minutes before I got to my senses and went back out into the store and told my boss. He just sighed and said "I know who it is. Just ignore it. I don't get why he keeps calling, we've done everything we can." </TEXT>

<TITLE> Very long time before chunks load? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-18 01:09:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Since the update (maybe even somet time before) I've had major issues with chunks taken a huge amount of time before loading when joining a new world.

If I, for example, join a world for a challenge, the first 50x50x# chunks loads fine (except when using rally blade), but it takes without a doubt 30-45 seconds before the chunks in my direction loads. So I can be stuck with my mount in an invisible wall for a period of time before being able to continue.

If I use a rally blade and end up at the same place as the rally blade is placed, I am placed in some kind of "limbo" until the chunks load.

Anyone else having this problem? </TEXT>

<TITLE> She's leaving today </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-30 12:24:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A few months back, I met this fantastic girl. She's beautiful, she's smart, she's quirky, we clicked instantly. We met a few times before we decided to go exclusive. Not a real relationship, but it was the two of us. She made me feel better. A lot better. With her, most of my anxiety was gone and I didn't want to hurt myself.

She had moved to my city because she was sick of the town she grew up in and wanted to get away. So she got a job here and moved in to a room that she rented. After a while, the job didn't go so well, her boss was being an ass to everyone and she had more anxiety going to job than she had had before. So she quit.

No job means no money which means she can't pay rent. So she's decided to move again, to her sister. And that is like 400 miles away from here. And she's leaving today. Her train leaves in like 3.5 hour. I don't know if we'll ever see each other again. Because neither her or me can handle a long distance relationship, so we decided to not continue anything.

And I just don't know what to do. I'm almost out of tears, I don't know what the fuck to do. I just want to go away. Just do bad things to myself that I've promised everyone that I won't do again. Shit, fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck. </TEXT>

For example, would you make something out an endangered type of wood (for example some kind of south american mahogny) if you were given a piece by a friend? </TEXT>

<TITLE> ELI5: How can we know what a color blind can/can't see? (attempt to clarify further in text) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-31 15:52:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After seeing [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/3f8ypy/normal_vision_vs_redgreen_colorblind/) and [this youtube clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBbCsNS8nco), I wonder - how is it possible for people with normal color vision to know which colors a color blind can and can not see? And how can we know that *this* is how it looks like to a color blind person?

And then - how can we correct their vision (as in the youtube clip)? How do glasses like that work and how can they "correct" the vision? Since we can't explain orange to someone who doesn't know what it looks like, we can't know if the person is seeing orange as we see it when getting a "correction", right? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Suggestion regarding teleportation </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-27 00:15:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ever since I started playing trove a bunch of months back, I've had this one thing poking me in the eye over and over again. And that is the teleportation system. The /joinme system is awesome. But what bothers me is the "You have to wait" thing.

There is no indication on how long you have wait, to begin with. Then, you get the cooldown even if the teleportation failed (such as "World full"). Or my biggest pet peeve - the fact that when you die and choose to return with E, you get a teleportation cooldown as well.

My suggestion is, remove it or at least put a timer on it so we know when we can use it again. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I got told that I'm triggering a friend of mine </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-19 15:13:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ok, so a post I made on facebook sparked a privte discussion between me and a friend of mine. The person told me that the online diary entries I've made talking about my preferences when it comes to BDSM are triggering and sends out "warning signals". My diary entries regarding BDSM. On a BDSM forum. The whole purpose of the site/community is for people within the BDSM (and LGBT) community to have their own online community where they can discuss, meet new people, whatever you do on communities without being judged by other people for their sexual preferences.

Every persons own page includes a tab called "Kinks" where you can fill out a form on what things turns you on, what things that are a big nono and so on, so that people know what other people enjoy. The site also has pretty strict rules to ensure that people have a safe space.

The person told me that I seem like a bad person when I've posted entries containing fantasies I have/have had. Those include rape play fantasies in one entry as well as one entry where I briefly think about wether it's the act of violence or the dominating part that turns me on the most. And apparently, these things are "triggering". 

Myself, I've never really cared for trigger warnings when it comes to written text (as well as "Viewer discretion is advised!" on TV shows) but I can understand that some people prefer them.

But then again, I feel like if you visit a community which is based around BDSM, people are going to write about it. The person told me that the only reason they didn't contact me about it was because they "1. Didn't want to comment on it." "2. Hoped that I would improve my ways".

Sorry for being all confusing and so. I just wanted to ventilate and know if I'm the one who's wrong in this situation or not. What do you guys say? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been using your Chrome add-on for a while now and I love it. Because of it, I don't have to keep constant track of when games are etc.

But one thing that I would like is that the streams you are directed to when clicking "LIVE" shall be in english if there is an english stream available. Because, to be honest, most streams are in english and most people have english as their primary language when watching streams. 

Or even better, make it possible to choose from multiple streams if more than one language is available. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a pretty easy question - do you actually like listening him casting? If so, why?

Because, imo I can't stand him. It's like listening to a nine year old casting. It's extremely unprofessional and juvenile. His choice of music between games is extremely irritating as well, even though that is easier to just mute and ignore.

And yes, I know that I can just stop watching the games he casts, but basically every time I don't have any other choice when it's a game I really want to watch.

So, what are your honest opinions? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was called in to work today at the caf I'm usually at. It's the hottest day of the year and the caf had just won a very big award for Best Newcomer. And with that said, it's pretty easy to guess that we had a shit ton to do. And we were only two.

In enter Silver Hair Lady. She is from the beginning extremely.... "salty". Very unfriendly towards both me and my coworker. They order the breakfast (which consists of yoghurt with granola, two freshly made sandwiches, apple must and coffee) and we tell her that she will receive one of the items first and the other one in a few minutes. They get their coffee, must and sandwiches and go out. We have a few tables out on the square. 

After a few minutes I am done with their yoghurt and head out. I manage to bump into her outside and I say "Here's your yoghurt!"

SHL replies with "Yeah. It would be nice if WE COULD EAT EVERYTHING AT THE SAME TIME."

I apologize and tell her that we have a lot of things to do today and that we are only two people.

Here comes the first problem. I can't find the guy she was with. I really can't. He's not sitting by any of our outside tables. After a few seconds, I see the man waving his arms high in the air.

From the other side of the square. 

This square has three cafs, one restaurant and a bakery, and it's pretty far between the places outside tables.

He gets the yoghurt, I apologize again and return in.

SHL is standing at the counter going "YEAH, IT WOULD BE REALLY NICE IF WE COULD EAT EVERYTHING AT THE SAME TIME." to my coworker. He replies with "Please. It's saturday, the sky is blue and people are out. You have to think about that. And we're only two here, so we are really stressed."

SHL: "Yeah. Maybe you should try and have some service mind." and then she goes out again.

Something tells me that the caf that just got a reward from one of the countries biggest restaurant guides with one of the reasons being the excellent service, I don't think bad service mind is the problem here.

I think the problem here is that you are sitting AT ANOTHER CAFS TABLE expecting lightning fast service. And maybe the fact that this was the hottest day of the year. And again, we were only two people working.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I recently came to think about a thing - how many of you guys aren't "seeing" or "feeling" very big?

I came to think about it when I looked at my erect penis and though to myself "Is this really what is considered big?" since I only have IRL experience with my own penis and have only had sex with women. So, I really don't consider my size to be small, but I also don't see myself as very big.

Is it just me, or do you guys also think about this sometimes?

<TEXT> Ok, I get that you guys probably get new threads about this horse all the time, but as a Swede who just recently found a few pictures of the Blue Mustang and am glad that I took a dump before doing so, even though it's broad daylight here, I have to wonder - is it anyone who doesn't find this horse terrifying?

If this would be the first thing I'd see when coming out of the airport, I would nope my ass back from wherever I came from. </TEXT>

<TITLE> ELI5: How do inflatable mascots work? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-02 17:29:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As a non american (and therefore extremely fascinated by sports team mascots) I have long wondered how the inflatable mascots work. I can not wrap my head around if there's a human being in there or not. Especially in clips like the Toronto Raptor [eats a cheerleader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRDsdWLqdBI) or the [dancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTOlKgkoTB8).

So please, could someone explain? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Guys.

Stop it. Seriously. I really don't care what the person has done. I am also sick of removing post after post after post due to the fifth rule.

After this post - anything posted containing a special reason in the title to why you want to punch the person will result in a five day ban.

EDIT: And before anyone asks - titles such as "This dumbfuck from tumblr", "This idiot on vine" etc are allowed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So. Our old head mod, mr hammy, left reddit, but not before kicking all the mods except for me and thus leaving the sub over to me. I have invited back the two other mods and we have also got the addition of /u/Space_Ninja. Say hi, everbody!

[So, yeah. This is what is going down](http://i.imgur.com/JbB421q.gifv)

Either way - as head mod I have changed/updated the rules slightly.

**First of all** - I added the rule against soapboxing again since hammy removed it. I really don't care about what the person has done. If the face isn't punchable, it's not punchable. 

**Second** - No. God. Damn. Politics.

It's ok to post faces of politicans [as with this](http://i.imgur.com/2vRiAWl.jpg), but we don't want you posting things with "This fucking asshole politicians who does things I don't like". I don't care if you hate what they are doing. Even if you like a person, they can have punchable faces.

**Third** - I added an imgur rule. Use imgur as image host, please. Otherwise your post will be removed.

**Fourth** - Posting a banned face will result in a three day ban. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What is the worst way you've seen a customer "ruin" a cup of coffee? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-20 18:54:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The placed I worked at before, the owner there went by the nickname "The Milk Nazi" for a while. This term was coined by some people at her old place when she recommended them to not have milk in their black coffee. This place was located in a "nicer part" of the town, and the residents didn't like being told how to drink their coffee. It was kinda like "Coffee is just coffee".

Either way - a while back, I worked for an online magazine as a writer and as we didn't have our own office, we used the local caf as our "office". (and no, we didn't buy one cup and sit there for four hours.)

After a while there, I noticed that there was an older man coming in a few times each day who ordered two coffees to go. What struck me was the amount of sugar he poured in it. At least six our seven teaspoons. At least. I can't imagine how awful it must've tasted.

So, what is the worst way you know a customer does to ruin a good brew? (Minus trying to order a mochachochalattefrappeparaplegic with extra pumpkin). </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I thought about this on my way home today. I have always drunk quite a lot of coffee. At least since high school. Although, now I've cut down alot on it.

When I work by the machine I usually drink around two or three single espressos a day, with all the testing and so on. Especially when we switch around alot and tune the machine after our own liking.

I mostly drink the cups I make when practicing with the milk. But I would say maybe two or three latte/cappuccino a day.

If it's a slow day, I consume another three or four, at least, cups of our regular black coffee.

If I'm home (which I am most of the time since I'm unemployed right now) I keep myself to two cups a day.

So, how much do you drink? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I started playing H G a day ago and reached level three today. Slightly excited about it, I chose to upgrade to the tank crew, paying my 22k.

Then I realized that I couldn't form a squad to search for games with a friend of mine who started playing today, so I chose to go back to infantry, for the small sum to get back. Then I realized, I have to pay 22k AGAIN to become tank crew. What the fuck? That really pissed me off.

I can understand that there's a fee first time doing it, but when wanting to go back and forth and trying out the different classes, why should one have to keep buying it? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-01-09 14:37:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi. About two years ago I watched a food show with some chef going around the world trying different local foods. And in one episode he cooked both chicken in a huge (like **huge**) ceramic vase/bowl. He also got to try and prepare a very interesting dish made out of pork (I'm pretty sure it's pork) that was shaped as a big square block that they cut thinly in to a really long "ribbon" that they put in a metallic pyramid and cooked. 

After that they kind of assembled this "meat pyramid" and garnished.

I'm sorry if this sounds really confusing but I hope you understand. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [MOD POST] Update of rules and such. Please read before posting. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-05 14:55:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ok. It's a new year and new life and yada yada yada. This year is also going to be filled people we want to punch in the face. Some old and most likely some new ones.

We, the mods, here at /r/punchablefaces have also some rules that we want you to follow.

* No political discussion or politically bias titles.

This means that you aren't aloud to post people solely based on his or her political choice. For example, don't post someone just because he or she is a republican.

Also, please keep the political discussion to a minimum. Political discussions takes place in /r/politics, not here.

* No posting/asking for personal information

This one is pretty self explanatory. Before you post someone here, make sure that no username or personal information is shown. Some people that are posted here are easy to use google image search on and some don't. If the person is a big celebrity (no, 70k followers on facebook does not count), then it's a difference.

* No posts/comments with racist, sexist, or homophobic content

Guys (and girls). There are subs for really hating on people and calling them such things. This is not one of those subs.

* No memes

Fortunately, we haven't had to deal with these yet.

An addition to the rules that I have had to explain a dozen times to people getting banned:

* **Rape. Is. Not. Ok**.

As a mod, I do not give a shit if you're joking.

* If you are banned and think that it is an unfair decision, you are more than welcome to [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fpunchablefaces), but dont expect being treated with kindness if your reply to being banned is "fuck off" "go fuck yourself" "hope you get raped" (Seriously things people have written to me when explained to why they are banned).

* Please check the banned faces section on the right. I update it about once a week. Some people will be removed after a while and some are there to stay. 


I think that's all from me now. Have a nice week. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, so a friend of mine posted something about "blue bean" on facebook a week or two ago. I wasn't 100% sure that it was the "female equivalent" of blue balls, so I asked. Apparently it's when your clitoris hurt from the same lack of stimulation as the balls during blue balls.

As a male, I have never heard of that expression (or the existance of something like this) until now. Are there more women who can confirm this? </TEXT>

[Uno](https://31.media.tumblr.com/25811730796437401bc50754fc2a2955/tumblr_ngm499c7Pn1s60ccyo1_1280.jpg), [dos](https://38.media.tumblr.com/842d3786268a1170a83f35a06a90974e/tumblr_ngm499c7Pn1s60ccyo2_1280.jpg) and [tres](https://33.media.tumblr.com/fdd6bc45f7c5d323912b3018326a031f/tumblr_ngm499c7Pn1s60ccyo3_1280.jpg).

This kind of freaks me out (but hey, everything does). But is there anyone else who have heard or read anything about this or is it just some asshats way of trying to make muslims look bad? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, as a barista in training I have gotten a few "a double *espresso based drink*, please" and for me, a "regular" cup is based on a double espresso. I don't make it from a single if the customer don't specifically asked for it. I'm from Sweden and all baristas I know have a double as a regular. It's mostly English speaking people who say "a double" when they order.

So I wonder, is it normal in countries like America, England etc to normally serve the drinks with only a single shot of espresso when not asked for a double? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've had this problem for a few weeks now. Sometimes, mostly while joining games, the game just crashes. No "This program is not responding", no hour glass to show that something fucked up, no nothing. It just crashes.

Well, up until like a day or two ago when it actually started freezing while joining games and then sometimes crash, and then sometimes not. I have to force shut down my computer since nothing works to exit PD.

I've also experienced a lot of problems regarding the black loading screen before pre mission lobby. Where the wheel just spins around and round and round.

I am currently using Windows 8.1 and have only had this occur on one game before and that was Skyrim. And it only happened once. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't get it. Why do people who are obviously shorter trying to hug a tall person with their arms over the shoulders?

I have friends that I have known for years who are still doing this. The only thing I can think about when doing that is "Are you deliberately trying to hurt me?". It's bad enough already that I have to bend my knees to hug them. </TEXT>

We have no idea where she came from, but she is well fed, very cuddly and very social.
There is no collar and from what I could see, no ear tag either.
Only "faults" on her otherwise are a few scars on her right ear (that are healed) and a bit of loss of fur just in front of the ears.

Any advice on how to take care of a "runaway" cat for over the night? My mum has knocked on the neighbors doors, but no one is answering.

We can't (and we're probably not aloud to either, by law) keep her permanently. </TEXT>

Because, a woman named Evalyn Lucien keeps showing up in the clues, but when I google her name, nothing else but the Jujune Institute and the movie. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From time to time, I hear the term "malt liquor" in both fictional movies and in documentaries. I kept wondering what the hell "malt liquor" was until I looked it up on wikipedia. As it turns out, it's just beer with an ABV higher than 6%. That would make most of the beer I buy "malt liquor".
So I ask you - how many of you (North Americans) refer to your stronger beer as "malt liquor"? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm sitting and watching The Next Great Baker and a guy comes in and says "how you doing?" And I reacted on the fact that he didn't reply. I started thinking about it and came to the conclusion that I often just hear it as a greeting phrase and not a real question.
I worked for a while with an American guy and even if he only went to the office for five minutes and came back, he always said "How you doing?"

So my question is as said - is this a regular greeting phrase nowadays? </TEXT>

I don't mean such cards as Pokmon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Magic etc.
I'm talking about Baseball Card, Hockey Cards, Football Cards.
I understand why people would buy, collect and trade cards such as the Pokmons - They had a meaning since you played games with them.

But why did the other cards that didn't have any real purpose except for collecting become such a hit? </TEXT>
