<TEXT> Didn't sound like an ass good sir.

I think cultural implications may have effected the way that I hurt myself more than whether or not I did. The first time I hurt myself intentionally that I know of was when I ground my fist into a wall repetitively, and I don't think that I've ever seen much of that in the media. So my first impulses to hurt myself stemmed from my own need for self destruction I would say; the ways I ended up hurting myself stemmed from the media most likely.

I believe that there is nothing wrong with the action of injuring yourself. The fact is, it's a sign of something else and that's the problem. If you fix up all those problems and still are cutting just because you're addicted, I really wouldn't see a problem besides the addiction itself. However, I find it very hard to believe that someone would hurt them self and not have an underlying problem besides addiction. I know that probably sounded pretty contradictory but I don't know how else to explain it. 

The reason I don't hurt myself right now despite my love for it is because I don't need it. I realize that unlike I did before. I have found other things to hold on to. The thing is, I cannot blame anyone who has yet to discover that. 

Sorry that was so long. Hope I explained that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I go to therapy. I don't cut anymore. It's not about attention from my parents. I had hell with my parents over cutting. It was an outlet for my anxiety and depression which began in my early childhood. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I always think about this, being in your situation and all. I would never know how to treat my child, I would never know how to take care of anyone with the same problem as myself. I have a list of wrongs though, since my parents did do some things that were less than exemplary:
If your child is closed up, let her be. Prying is the most damaging thing I have experienced from my mother. I recall multiple accounts where I felt more guilt for not being able to vocalize what I felt, and she felt more guilty for worsening my conditioning. This circle of negative emotion sometimes led me to having a panic attack.
Also never deny a child's pain or issues. But clearly from your post you don't do that. 
Don't ask to see the cuts, don't send the kid to doctors once a week to check on the cuts. Unless you know your child is cutting to a point where they may cut too deep or they need hospitalization, it is rather stressful and shameful to be inspected once a week. Therapy is good.
Thank you for taking care of your daughter. Sorry I'm not much help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yea, I actually started hurting myself without a razor and migrated to it. As in I hurt myself without knowing that I was doing something that was close to cutting. Then I slowly changed methods until I actually was cutting. I doubt I would have figured out that method if the media didn't glamorize that method, but I still hurt myself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh I'm medicated. They just make me such a zombie. Topamax and Zoloft are the current owners of my brain. I guess it's better.

Now I'm absurdly curious about your past.. wanna elaborate a little? Sorry to keep bugging you : </TEXT>

<TEXT> The cuts were made to provide me with something and those cuts happened to scar. 

Sorry I came off as sassy, I didn't mean to be. It was either my stupid humor, or just my inability to know how you'd react. I just deal with this misconception a lot.

I posted the AMA in hopes that people would come with open minds rather than jumping to the attention card. I don't show my scars, thus they aren't being used to stimulate a reaction in others.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I sometimes would be proud of a scar, but that pride always fades just as the scar does a little. I find my scars more shameful just because I often get treated like utter dirt for them.

I don't even know how I would learn from the pain. I will always want more more more.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm in marching band and I volunteer at the library. I'm bored because it's 8 on a school  night. I totally agree with you though. When you have time to sit around and do nothing but be anxious and hate everything its way easier to dig yourself into a hole. 

My therapy is a special kind called DBT. It focuses on meditation and being one with your body. It is the only kind of therapy that has helped me (despite my youth I have rotated through many therapies.) 

Thank you very much. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know! I made my own throw away account for it and everything. 

To be honest, now I can't fuck anyone without being insecure about the scars on my thighs or thinking about whether or not anyone will think I'm beautiful. I ruined myself with my own hands because of my own stupidity. If you want to think that two years ago I began hurting myself and then hiding it for the next year nonstop for attention, go for it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love pain usually. Anything serves. Now that I don't cut I find a lot of other types of pain even more satisfying it seems. Pulling my hair and burning are other types of self injury I've engaged in.

I have an addictive personality so usually I can get my fix from other things (alcohol, setting fire, puking, starving myself, etc.) but most of it is self destructive and thus I attempt to avoid it all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> oh yea i know the chemistryish stuff, but i don't know exactly why i'm like this. i have a lot of repressed memories, but my childhood wasn't bad. so it seems as though I've always been somewhat dissociated or something. genetics can screw you over :P. 

I see a therapist weekly, I'm on meds. Cutting is in my past, trying to keep it that way. Thanks for your non researched info :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was actually really dissociated for a while, so I really didn't think or feel much when I cut myself. It was kind of like an attempt for me to get back to reality, but I just couldn't do it. Everything about the blood and the pain and the endorphins gave me a little bit of a high before I dropped back in to my zombie-like state. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've had points where I thought about death a lot, but my two brothers always made it so clear that they cared about me that there would be way too much guilt for me to off myself. Plus, there have been three suicides in my school in the last two years. I know the damage it causes on the community, and I feel as though my pain does not justify hundreds of other people hurting far more. </TEXT>
