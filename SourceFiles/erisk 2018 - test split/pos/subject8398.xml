<TEXT> High school art teacher said we had a $20 art fee. I asked my mom for the money, she gave it to me in cash, and I gave it to the teacher. A week later she asked me for the same fee. I told her I gave her the money and she said "oh don't you try that on me!" So I went to my mom and asked for $20 again. My mom gave me another $20, I gave it to the teacher, and a few days later she posted our grades on the wall. I had an A on every project, but for my overall grade she knocked me down to a B. I asked why, and she said "you know what you did." I was a junior in high school at the time so this was when my gpa really mattered, I was so angry but I didn't know any better so I didn't do anything about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I felt really shitty in high school because I didn't get top grades like most of my classmates (I went to those super academic intensive high schools where half the population was Asian) and one day our teacher told us our assignment was to write the first chapter of a novel. I got overly excited and wrote 15 pages when the requirement was 10, whereas my classmates who were going to MIT and Yale all choked and didn't have a creative bone in their bodies. It made me realize I was at least good at SOMETHiNG.

So far I have only published a novella with small press (have nonfiction writing too but that doesn't count) and am trying to get something bigger out. By day I work as a data admin. </TEXT>

Turns out he was a rags-to-riches story about an uneducated guy teaching himself mathematics until he became a professor, which was printed out in communist propaganda back during the Cultural Revolution. So he was temporarily famous, like Balloon Boy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well I don't know whether you are a tenor or baritone, but what I do know is that it's easier for everyone to sing low than high when they first start out. I was convinced I was a very low alto myself because my lowest note was (and still is) a very loud E3. I was confused when voice teachers and choir directors kept saying I was a soprano, I started tensing up badly whenever I was expected to go into the 5th octave instead of opening up, hence painful squeaking.

Since it sounds like you don't take voice lessons it is highly possible your technique is all wrong. You can't expect a shower singer to nail Pavarotti's high notes, natural tenor or not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I read it and saw the movie. I enjoyed the book a lot, one of the biggest changes is that Cosette is a much bigger character in the book. In fact I'd say she is the next biggest character after Jean Valjean. Victor Hugo can't write decent young female characters so she is pretty much brain-dead and idolized, but she is so crucial to the story. They fleshed out the relationship between Marius and Cosette as well, in the book they dated for a year before the battle. 

But yeah Victor Hugo wrote Les Mis and The Hunchback of Notre Dame and he definitely has some parallels between the two. If you turn out liking Les Mis I would recommend Hunchback next, it is VERY different from the movie (torture, creepy old man tries to rape a high school aged Esmeralda, public floggings, etc.) </TEXT>

I like looking at videos of people dying, you can find that on certain parts of the internet. I will watch a video of an Isis beheading and stuff, or a mob violence in another country where they all attack a thief and torture them. Some people can't stomach that whereas I find it interesting. People wouldn't expect that from me, I am constantly described as innocent even, because I also sing in a choir and dress like a girly-girl.

I also go on walks on my own late at night, I will sing songs from musicals and pretend I am acting in front of a group of people. </TEXT>

Women - because liberals tend to be pro-choice and support programs for single mothers, women feel liberal ideology looks out in their favor

Starbucks - I don't think there is really a correlation

White - I don't think this is true, so many SJWs bash white people and say white privilege this and white privilege that. SJWs come in all colors. </TEXT>

I moved out very fast. As in, my mom was screaming at me and I was crying and just grabbed my purse, climbed in my car, and drove out with nothing else. I spent the next day buying a pair of jeans and cheap shirts that I could rotate through, along with toothbrushes and other things I needed.

<TEXT> Even when I was a little kid, my mom would always point out I had single eyelids and a flat nose, and that I got that from my dad because she had a very straight nose and double eyelids. If someone complimented my appearance my mom would quickly counter it with "no she's not."

Then when I was in the second grade and had to wear glasses, my dad and mom got in a HUGE fight. My dad told my mom that he would divorce her if she made me wear glasses, and when my mom won out my dad would see me walking around with glasses on and comment that I was ugly. When I pointed out he wore glasses too, he said it was different because he was a man.

Then when I was 16-ish I was five foot 7 and 130 pounds. My mom started always yelling at me, saying I was a fat pig. When I told her to stop saying it, she would say "If I don't tell you who is going to tell you?" She only shut up years later, when her friends told her to stop. She would make a comment about how big my thigh is, or how big my butt is, when I walked by.

Once when my mom was talking about how ugly I was at a big dinner, this old lady who knew my mom ever since she was little said, "Actually, your daughter is prettier than you were when you were her age" and that shut my mom up (at least for that meal).
Then when I visited my dad in China, I had dinner with him, my aunt, and my cousin. My aunt called me pretty and my dad quickly rejected her comment, talking about everything that he felt was wrong with my appearance. My aunt was so shocked that she told my other aunt, and my other aunt said my dad isn't normal for publically criticizing his daughter's looks in front of other people.

Anyway, as an adult I looked back at old pictures of myself from when I was certain I was ugly. I was surprised to see I was actually a cute kid. I later asked my mom why she constantly insulted my looks when I was a kid, and she said it was because she didn't want me to have a big head. Fuck that bitch. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And she is every bit as good as the other soloists, maybe even better. When she sang Dulcissima, the whole room went silent because she was AMAZING!!! I am fangirling over her right now even though I am normally such a critic. Her voice was crystal clear and resonating beautifully throughout the whole thing. The choir director was all smiles and gave her a hug afterwards, apparently he originally planned to hire a professional soloist but someone had recommended her, so he auditioned her privately first and then realized she really could do it. She was prodigy level good. I really wanted to post a recording here but it's against the rules.

Anyway, I have a few questions about that. Usually people here would say that your voice is all over the place at that age or that music like that is way too challenging for someone so young, yet clearly this girl was an exception.

Someone that young can't possibly have had many years of vocal training, can they? I have heard lots of voice teachers won't even work with someone under the age of 16. If that girl is 16/17 she must have gotten crazy good in a short amount of time. I feel bad by comparison, having taken lessons for 4 months and done choirs for 3 years, but nowhere near that good. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was reading Anne of Green Gables for the first time this week and couldn't believe it was middle grade fiction. It could easily pass as adult fiction, especially in the later books when Anne is an adult dealing with adult problems, and the books have adult prose and are of an adult length. I found it interesting it is middle grade.

It got me thinking, Little Women is also young adult. What are some other kid and teen books with literary merit? I am especially interested in modern ones.

Edit: I meant to say "WHAT are some children's and teen books," not why, oops!" </TEXT>

<TEXT> I knew a girl (she was 23) who would make up stories to impress people. I started getting suspicious because her stories were very dramatic and didn't match up. She told one girl that her first boyfriend pretended to love her and then broke up with her right after she slept with him, and another girl that her first boyfriend died tragically in a car accident and that she found a letter afterwards of him declaring his love for her. She constantly chimed in during conversations with outrageous movie-plot stories.

Now, this young woman was very overweight and extremely unattractive. At one point she was talking about all the guys she had given blowjobs to and I blurted out "what does cum taste like?" She threw her head back and laughed, and I asked, "No really, what does it taste like?"

Then she went silent for a while, and then said "like Jello." When I pointed out Jello didn't have a taste, she then started faltering and saying she didn't remember, it was suddenly only one guy, and he was drunk (as if him being drunk were the reason SHE wouldn't remember).

I mean, I get that she probably was lonely and had social issues her whole life. There was definitely a sad aspect to it. My roommate was her friend, so one day when the two of them were walking together my roommate told her she didn't have to make up stories and to just be herself. The fat girl insisited she wasn't making up stories, they were all true, my roommate said everyone knew the stories were fake. They talked, my roommate thought everything was good after that, and then the fat girl went around saying my roommate was bullying her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When Japan invaded China, the reason they were so successful at invading a much bigger country was that the Chinese were so used to being invaded by Westerners that they no longer cared. They assumed the Japanese would treat them better than the Chinese government of the time, even, so huge cities of Chinese men would just wave white flags in the air and wait for a tiny band of Japanese soldiers to come tie them up one by one. They assumed they would get treated well and have their lives spared for being obedient. Meanwhile, the Japanese did not believe in surrender and was disgusted by this display of what they considered cowardice.

Once all the weapons of Chinese soldiers were confiscated, they would get lined up in front of a trench and get bayonetted one by one. </TEXT>

<TITLE> A friend of mine with a huge vocal range was told he was a tenor, a baritone, and a bass from different voice teachers. Why would there be so much variation? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-24 21:51:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A friend of mine back in college told me that the first time he joined his university's choir, the choir director had him sing up the scales and then put him under tenor after he managed to go up to a B4 or so. He was dying in the tenor section, so he asked the choir director if he could move to bass. She tested him again, and when she saw how low he could go she said "Oh my god, why did I put you under tenor?" And moved him.

After that he took voice lessons for free from the university, and the voice teacher too said he was a tenor and that he just needed practice at the high end. He sang with her for a little bit, decided he didn't like her, and took lessons with 2 other teachers who told him he was a baritone. Last I heard, he got a new teacher who is now teaching him to sing as a bass.

How could there be that much variation from all these professionals? One of the reasons I am asking is because I have always been told I was a soprano by choir directors and voice teachers despite my low notes, but on a post I made yesterday some people were speculating I was actually more of an alto. It makes me wonder if I was miscategorized and am being trained incorrectly? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been teaching myself Ancient Greek, but I live in Southern California and there don't seem to be many resources here - no one here seems to know it, I can't sign up for classes. I did take Latin for 4 years in high school though.

I know the English translation, so working backwards I think...

Aeide is infinitive, second person singular

Thea is vocative?

Peleiadeo is genetive (of Peleus)

Axileos is nominative?

I know "menin" means Rage by process of elimination, is that the nominative?

<TEXT> Thank you for the input - Think of Me is one of the songs my voice teacher is having me work on, which is why I was considering it. Since she is training me as a soprano almost all the music I work on is soprano music, although when I am singing high notes during lessons she compliments how open they are - maybe I am only tightening here because I recorded it in my car.

Maybe Don't Cry for Me Argentina would be better for me, or that Moana song </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since choir audition season is approaching, I need to prepare a song for various choir auditions. I have only sung second soprano in SSAATTBB choirs, but I think I can do the other female parts too (although not sure how well I can sing a harmony, have enough trouble finding my notes as an S2).

Would Think of Me from Phantom of the Opera be a good audition song or is it too cliche? What other song is better? I have done 3 years of choir throughout my life and 4 months of voice lessons. 28/F.

This is me singing it, I fake a man voice for the guy part lol.

<TEXT> A conversation between me and my 23-year-old roommate. She is so sweet, but so clueless.

Roommate: I am applying to an art school in the US.

Me: Cool! Which one?

Roommate: (she names some crappy college they do ads for on TV)

Me: Wait, why there?

Roommate: It's the best.

Me: Says who?

Roommate: I looked online for the best art schools and it shows up.

Me: That's an ad! No, okay, you know how you always go on DevianArt? Why not talk to your favorite artists and ask them where they went to school?

*a week later*

Roommate: I found out where to do my master's degree! I was talking to my favorite artist on DevianArt like you said, and he told me about his school!

Me: His own school? He's a teacher?

Roommate: No, he's just a student. He's 16, but he says he is going there when he graduates from high school.

Me: YOU ASKED A 16 YEAR OLD WHERE TO DO YOUR MASTER'S DEGREE? What does he know, he's 16!

My roommate then started giggling uncontrollably, like it just occurred to her she did something dumb after I said that out loud. </TEXT>

If anyone comes over I'm going to pretend I'm normal and put it all in a drawer. Until then I shall enjoy the extra 1 hour a week I save from not folding my laundry. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the first questions people ask is where your parents live. Then when they find out my mom lives a 40 minute drive away, they ask if I visit her a lot. Then why not. And I always fee uncomfortable, I am afraid they will think I would make a bad life partner if I come from a broken family. But at the same time, maybe I WOULD make a bad life partner because I have so many skeletons in my closet.

I am 28 and female and I feel really lonely because of my family problems, I don't have brothers or sisters. Right now I don't have close friends either, everyone is scattered around the world and I can't talk to anyone. I have a decent job as an IT data grunt, doesn't make 6 figures but I can manage on my own. Just lonely all the time. </TEXT>

You far from ruined your entire life. The great thing about background checks is that your previous employer can comfirm you worked at a place but they won't say why you left. You can always pretend you left for other reasons if you want. It may be different if you are applying for a government job, but you will be fine for corporate work. </TEXT>

He contacted me again a few hours later, saying he was so sorry and I was an angel for still talking to him, and promised to make it up to me on our next date. Then an hour before the date he said he was stuck in traffic, can we move it back an hour and a half, and then an hour and a half later he said he would be there in 25 minutes. Then he disappeared and wouldn't take my calls.

<TEXT> 28/F I Could Have Danced All Night
4 months of voice lessons, 3 years of choir

In previous posts I was told this could be a good audition song for a classical choir (I have only ever sung second soprano so I think that's what they would make me try out for) but I dunno, maybe another song would be better?

I have trouble at the end of each of the 3 sections because I kind of belt the beginning, which makes it harder to then shift up past the break so maybe I need a different song (or a hell of a lot more training).

The main difference is that when I exhale, you don't hear it do that annoying pop that a crummy microphone will do if you hold it near your mouth. Otherwise it is fairly close. </TEXT>

Me: It is not the divorce. It was getting beaten constantly, she would even shove me with her foot when I was already on the ground...

Her: See, everyone else would have long since forgotten about those things. That is just your depression causing you to keep thinking about it.

I ended up hanging up on her because she kept trying to shame me into talking to my mom. I have been no-contact with my mom since last October and have proved tremendously since then. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I met some guy through match.com who asked me out. We had fun talking for 2 hours, he said he wanted us to meet again. He named the place and time, and I got all dressed up and arrived there. 10 minutes before the date starts he sends me a text saying he had a migraine and wanted to reschedule for today. Later when his migraine is apparently over, he texts me all apologetic and says I am an angel for even talking to him still, asks me questions about my choir and stuff.

So today I was supposed to meet him again, and again an hour before the date he says he is stuck in traffic coming home from another city. He reschedules it for an hour and a half later, I say okay. Then an hour and a half later he says he just got home, can he pick me up in 20 minutes. I say okay. An hour has passed since then, he still hasn't contacted me, I call him and he doesn't pick up, and now I see he has even blocked me from his online dating profile.

Wtf? I didn't know this guy before, why would anyone go through all that work just to mess with me? I'm 28, not ugly, get along with everyone I know, quiet, etc. I am guessing this guy got hurt by other girls so he did stuff to intentionally hurt me because I was female or something? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I was a creative writing major and graduated in 2010 during the peak of the recession. I couldn't find work for 6 months (may be longer but that was when I moved) and my mom screamed at me non-stop every day for being a failure until I had a severe mental breakdown and someone called the police when I ducked under the eave of their house in the middle of the night to hide from the rain (I had walked in the rain for 7 hours).

Since I was always considered a good writer I did manage to eventually get small freelance writing jobs and eventually a full time job proofreading manuals for a tech company, and from there on I learned new software skills and now make a comfortable 60k a year doing Tableau/Salesforce/SSRS admin stuff. 4 years of college do not necessarily give you a good job - in fact a single year in some community college tech certification program can most likely get you further than a liberal arts degree.

If you aren't afraid of hard work I recommend a double major. </TEXT>

Luckily I have a good and stable full time job now, found one maybe 2 months later and I have been there for 3 and a half years with a couple raises. </TEXT>

I text back asking if he is stranded somewhere and I need to pick him up, he said he JUST made it home and the migrane hit him. I feel he might be messing with me.

<TEXT> Well the girl in the video was maybe 14 so you aren't much older than her. 

Well I am still fairly new to singing (3 years of choir and 4 months of voice lessons) so you'd have to take what I say with a grain of salt, but I could (and still can) go down a loud, rumbling low E when I was 17 to make people laugh. Then when I joined my first college choir I squeaked my way up to a G and got placed under soprano. I was dying in the soprano section and asked the choir director if I could move to alto, he said no and that I just needed practice to hit those notes. I meanwhile took some free voice lessons with the university and explained my dilemma to the voice teacher, she frowned and said that I sounded like a soprano to her. I then tried joining another choir, got turned down but the choir director once again said I was a soprano.

Joined another choir years later, got placed under soprano again. Took voice lessons, voice teacher says I am a soprano. I guess they cant ALL be wrong. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're 30? You honestly act like you are 15. In every post I see you spouting delusions. Look, you clearly go flat when you go high and insist you aren't after everyone points it out, you tell professional musicians that they don't know what off-key means, you assume you know your voice type based on range when you are an untrained singer who clearly does not have the vocal ability to access their full range (plus timbre and tessitura matter more anyway), you post clips of yourself wailing in pain and expect compliments without realizing that the first rule of singing is that people are supposed to not wince in pain from hearing it, and whenever anyone offers something constructive you argue because you are so convinced you know so much more than even professionals.

Look, your singing is terrible and you don't sound any better than any other shower singer. You honest to god suck and on top of that you seem to have a narcissistic personality disorder that makes you assume you know what you are talking about when you clearly don't. I have never seen a user get consistently downvoted as much as you have. You make an ass out of yourself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because "how are you" isn't real question. It's a greeting. "Fine" is the only acceptable answer when you don't know someone.

"How old are you" "20" is a genuine lie. You are attempting to mislead someone. If you genuinely lie to someone to date them, whether it be lying about your age, pretending to want kids when you don't, or pretending you are single when you're not, you are actually building a relationship on false pretenses. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for your input,

There are two voice teachers in my area, one isn't very musical (she uses just karaoke CDs and we warm up a cappella) but she is good at explaining things, and the other is very musical (can play any sheet music on the piano) but terrible at explaining things other than saying "like this". I am taking lessons with the one who is better at explaining things because with the more muscial teacher I learned absolutely nothing technique-wise. I do worry I don't have the best teacher, last lesson I asked if she had a good 2nd soprano audition song for a choir and most of my 30 minutes was her rummaging through her cabinets to find her Fiddler on the Roof book instead of us actually singing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I started taking lessons in December. I am 28, female, 
have sung regularly for 11 years, done 2 years of choir, and started taking voice lessons for the first time in December 2016.

I recorded this song in December after I got my very first song assignment, and I sang it again today now that I have had lessons for 3 months. I learned to do some things differently, mainly to resonate through the mask and how to stay relaxed. It is $500+ in lessons already so I would hope there is SOME improvement. I feel like it improved when I sing, but after I hear it recorded back I don't know if I can tell a difference.

They have very little marketing power though, the cover art was so bad (I think the artist must have been a high school student) that people tell me it turned them off from buying the book. There is also little promotion, all they did was put the book on their webpage that people don't visit. I got only 17 sales in 6 months and they were mainly people I knew. </TEXT>

It was on. For weeks I grew my army until it was so massive I had to wake up in the middle of the night to feed it so it wouldn't starve. Finally it was ready. The guy showed up to farm my account and I whipped out my massive army on my low level account and decimated him. Since I was several levels lower than him he lost an epic amount of points.

He then grew his army again and tried again a week or so later, and I beat him again. He quit after that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Worst manager was an old guy who tried to take credit for stuff I did rather than just admit he couldn't do it. He would get stuck on some software, ask me for my help, and then robotically say "Yup that's how I would've done it" when you can see he did try multiple times because now he has all these broken formulas that you have to delete to avoid cluttering the workbook. He also tried to pull rank, stuff like calling me over the phone to tell me to come into his office when his office was literally less than 10 feet away. Anyway, when our company got bought out by another company, he spoke up for both of us and talk the bigger company into hiring us, the bigger company saw I was doing the work while he was gerting the pay, so they laid him off but not me. Since then I have had 2 raises.

My best manager would never give you an assignment he wouldn't have done himself. He sometimes made you work past 10pm, but he would be sitting there working along with you instead of just pawning stuff on you while he went home early. He would make sure you got to present the stuff you worked on, he genuinely wanted to see you get further ahead in your career. We all loved him, he is still my Facebook friend. </TEXT>

Also in every choir I have ever auditioned for they always ask me what part I have sung previously, and sometimes they only test that. They sometimes don't even test how low I can go. Why is that? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think attractiveness is too objective for someone to say what rating they are. I have been described as a "ten" before but definitely there will still be people who don't find you the least bit attractive. For example, some people say Taylor Swift is hot as hell and her fame is partly due to her looks, others will say she isn't attractive at all to them.

Meanwhile, my dating life is pretty similar to Taylor Swift's without the songs lol, I've dated quite a few guys but 90% of the time I am single because the relationships were little more than flings. Probably because the relationships themselves were very shallow - some guy is into me because they find me physically attractive, I realize it and then date them for the thrill, but our personalities don't work well together at all. </TEXT>

You end up being old man bait. You get a lot of unwanted attention from men old enough to be your father. You feel yourself avoiding eye contact when talking to a middle-aged stranger because if you seem approachable they will start hitting on you, some won't take no for an answer. People will assume you slept with your manager to get your job. People will be nicer to you but a lot of it is conditional. Little kids and babies will like you a lot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The actual prose style, the whole book used very unnecessarily flowery language.

Here is an excerpt: 

I still smart a little at the slight. When you've suffered a great deal in life, each additional pain is both unbearable and trifling. My life is like a memento mori painting from European art: there is always a grinning skull at my side to remind me of the folly of human ambition. I mock this skull. I look at it and I say, "You've got the wrong fellow. You may not believe in life, but I don't believe in death. Move on!" The skull snickers and moves ever closer, but that doesn't surprise me. The reason death sticks so closely to life isn't biological necessity -- it's envy. Life is so beautiful that death has fallen in love with it, a jealous, possessive love that grabs at what it can. But life leaps over oblivion lightly, losing only a thing or two of no importance, and gloom is but the passing shadow of a cloud. The pink boy also got the nod from the Rhodes Scholarship committee. I love him and I hope his time at Oxford was a rich experience. If Lakshmi, goddess of wealth, one day favours me bountifully, Oxford is fifth on the list of cities I would like to visit before I pass on, after Mecca, Varanasi, Jerusalem and Paris.

<TEXT> I got asked out without knowing I was asked out. Once I was standing with 2 guys and one of them said "we should hang out some time" and I thought he meant the 3 of us hang out as friends. I said okay, he asked for my number, and told me to meet him downstairs from the dorm. Was a date.

Another time I had a classmate tell me he had a group of friends he wanted me to meet, I wanted to make new friends so I said okay, and then he picks me up in a car with only a guy and girl making out in the back. He told me the others canceled, whoops.

Neither of these surprise dates ended in a second date. </TEXT>

Personality-wise someone who is sincere.

That guy is throwing a bunch of lines at you because he think that's what ~women~ want to hear and he's reducing you to something interchangeable with anyone else who is female. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Haha they're pretty different from the movie though:

-Dorothy is younger than 15, I'd say around 10. And she has short blonde hair.

-Oz was real, she doesn't wake up

-Glinda was the good witch of the South, not the North. The good witch of the North wasn't in the movie, she was a cheery woman who gave Dorothy a kiss on the forehead for protection. That's why the movie had a major plothole with Glinda knowing the answer the whole time - in the book Glinda is the most powerful of the 4 witches and so Dorothy seeks her out after the wizard leaves.

-The Tin Woodman used to be a human, but he fell in love with a girl and her mom was an evil witch (different evil witch) who cursed  him to make his ax slip. The first time he cut off his arm, got a magical arm, then the other arm, etc. until he was completely made of tin.

-Witch wasn't green, slippers weren't red

Not all the Oz books feature Dorothy though, she is in maybe 4 of them? There's a pretty big cast of characters.

But yeah Frank L. Baum is the author. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was a huge bookworm as a kid, so I've got this.

-Enchanted Forest Chronicles by Patricia C Wrede. Basically it's a wacky comedy fairy tale world except the characters are all a little weird.

-the Oz books that The Wizard of Oz comes from, The Wizard of Oz was just the first book of a series by the author. The Scarecrow becomes the emperor of the North, Dorothy is best friends with the new ruler Princess Ozma, and Auntie Em and Uncle Henry end up living in Oz after they lose their house.

-Princess Nevermore - about a 15 year old princess from a fairy tale world who accidentally gets whisked off to the modern world. She meets an old man and his grandkids, and enrolls in the local high school. It becomes a high school drama, eventually she returns to her own world.

I already mentioned Ella Enchanted. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ella Enchanted would me amazing for her. It's nothing like the movie, way darker. It's the story of Cinderella, but Cinderella was cursed by an incompetent fairy to be obedient and her mom and fairy godmother try to keep everyone from learning her secret so she won't be taken advantage of. Eventually the stepsister finds out, and you know the story from there.

<TEXT> Voice types in singing. When I see youtube videos of singers there will always be people who know nothing about singing but are quick to say so-and-so is this voice type based on what high notes they hit, when in fact voice type has more to do with where your natural voice is set and not what notes you can reach. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello, what is a good audition song for a more traditional choir I can add to my voice lesson practices? I sing Soprano II in my current choir, voice teacher says my type is technically soprano but I've only had a few months of lessons. Confident vocal range is from maybe A3 to Bb5, but I can go down as E3 if I "dig" for it. 

A comfortable, easy song for me to sing is something like I Could Have Danced All Night from My Fair Lady. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My boyfriend and I were college students at the time, both virgins. He was really cheesy and sheltered (his mom was Thai and apparently very strict) and right when we were about to have sex I asked if he had condoms. He said he did and jumped up to get some. I remember him walking off, looking kind of girly in how skinny and girlish his frame was.

Anyway, I watch him put on the condom, and immediately after he put it on he got soft. He pulled it off, rubbed himself, and when he got hard again he tried to put it on and went soft again. He gave an embarrassed laugh and tried to enter me soft with the condom dangling, that did NOT work.

He then said "it wasn't meant to be" and we just ate ice cream in silence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> East Asians aren't smarter as a whole, the reason they seem smarter to you is because the cultures put more emphasis on education. Not only that, but the families who immigrate here tend to be from upper middle class backgrounds with advanced degrees and highly-sought professions. Go to the rural parts of an east Asian country and you will meet the same type of hillbillies you will meet in any rural area.

Dogs are bred through eugenics. You take the two smartest dogs you know, mate them even if they are related, mate their babies together, and do that generation after generation. Humans are not controlled the same way.

I am guessing you assume whites are smarter than blacks. Possibly due to advancements in European technology. Well, humans have been around for what, a million years? Guess how long all that modern technology has been around. Most technical advancements only came during only came during the Industrial Revolution, less than 200 years ago.

Think of how so many things happened during the Renaissance. Does that mean no one was smart before then, and all the smart people popped up at the same time. Of course not, a civilization can't flourish unless there is economic and political stability along with the right resources. If Stephen Hawking had been born in Africa he would have been fucked. You can't assume one race is dumber than another based on what inventions have come out or what grades the kids are getting in school because there are so many other underlying factors. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My aunt was belittling my depression and telling me stories about so-and-so who had also been beaten by their parents and turned out fine.

"Your cousin's husband's mom stabbed him through the back of the hand with a pencil over his grades, the lead broke off in his hand and left a permanent mark, but you should see how caring he is towards her!"

"I hit your cousin regularly when she wouldn't play the piano properly, then your grandmother would start yelling at me because she babied your cousin, it was so annoying, that is why your cousin never learned how to play the piano. You know what she told me the other day? She said that she wished she had kept at it because she doesn't have any special talents to show off during her company party. Look how much your mother cared about you, she did it for your sake!"

She keeps saying my depression caused me to fixate on my childhood problems, as opposed to my childhood problems causing my depression. She only acknowledges that my parents' divorce had an impact on me.

Sometimes I do feel weak, since I do know people in Mainland China have crazy parents who do what mine do only they don't suffer depression years after the fact. I don't know if it's because I grew up in a country where it wasn't seen as normal so I felt more wronged or what. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For us there were 2 programs, one was IQ-based and the other was based on academics. I got in the first program but not the second, which got me in a lot of trouble because my parents were convinced I wasn't trying hard enough. Meanwhile I was convinced the school made a mistake and switched up IQ tests on me.

I later found out I got diagnosed with ADHD at a very young age and my mom didn't see it as a legit thing so she kept trying to beat it out of me. That is why I am 28 and still bitter lol. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mom complained loudly about me to her sister over Skype, she would go on and on and everything she said about me was negative whereas my aunt would try to defend me. Anyway, I would sometimes get so mad I would go unplug the router for a split second and then plug it back in. My mom is a monologuer so she would talk for another good 5 minutes or so before she realized her sister stopped responding and restart the call. If I did it 3 times during a call she would give up and say the internet was choppy that day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In high school I was in the Latin club and every year we had the state Latin convention. One year I was watching the mock beauty competition and only 1 girl tried out. They said they couldn't just hand the award out, so they would take people from the audience. I had a crush on a boy in my class and he turned to me and told me to try out. I said no but he talked me into it because I had a crush on him for 3 years (I was ugly and wore glasses). I went on stage, sang the Star Spangled Banner a capella, and was voted the winner of the beauty pageant despite being a frumpy kid in jeans and a sweater.

The girl who actually tried out and got all dressed up was pretty mad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been in your shoes. As in, I have also (and still do) want my parents to die. I did get beaten a lot growing up and wasn't allowed to have an opinion. When I was 22 I went nuts and walked in the rain for 7 hours until the cops brought me home because I was basically under house arrest after I graduated college. I turned into a workaholic for a couple years after I got my first job and am now doing well financially, not so well psychologically still but better than I was when I was in your shoes.

My advice: accept a job or two jobs. You can get a place for cheap over Craigslist if you rent a room out of a house. Lots of rooms come furnished already. Get your own bank account and if you can't you can just get cash back when using a debit card at a grocery store to have your own money to spend. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My Name Is Malala - girl in Pakistan talks about life under the Taliban. She wrote stories for the BBC under a pseudonym and her dad was an activist. Eventually she even got shot by the Taliban because she was campaigning for girls to go to school. The bullet went through her head, but she survived, and even that is in the book.

This one is lesser known but very well written: Killing Time in Iraq by Colby Buzzell. He was a lazy bum of a 25 year old from the Bay Area and he decided to join the army back in 2003 just for kicks. He talks about going to Iraq, being way in over his head at times, and really messed up stuff. For example there is a point where a female soldier is raped and he and others in his unit were told to say they knew nothing about it - they weren't even asked if they knew something. Then there is stuff about paranoia over the explosions, a guy getting blown up the day he was submitting his resignation to go home, bonding with local Iraqis who are seen as traitors by the Taliban and have horrendous stuff happen to their families, etc. The book goes into his head and he isn't afraid of making himself look bad, which I loved - lots of memoir writers paint themselves as special snowflakes (looking at you Anna Kendrick!) whereas his was brutally honest and effortlessly intelligent. You can find an article by him here to see how he writes: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/driving-uber-as-an-iraqi-war-veteran </TEXT>

<TEXT> I dunno how feminist I consider myself but a boyfriend of mine said I was a feminist just because I would occasionally speak up, so I'd give this question a try.

-Any celebrity who takes off their clothes for a magzine shoot and say it's "liberating" wtf you're giving some guy jerking material because you can't make it on talent alone.

-Blaming the 70 cents on the dollar thing on men. It's not men that's the problem. No one's going to pay you more for working less hours, you can say you have kids at home all you want but there is no reason an EMPLOYER would pay you more for that.

-When I read A Doll's House in high school (or was it college?) it was passed off as a feminist book. Why? Because at the end, the main character abandons her husband and children to ~find herself~. I found it appalling that it's being celebrated when she chose to abandon her children. It wasn't a pro-feminist message at all, a pro-feminist message would be having more inner strength than others, taking responsibility for the people who depend on you, etc.

-Making women seem like the victims for every possible thing imaginable. How the hell is that pro-women? </TEXT>

At 8.22 a.m., Molins said, Belgacem grabbed a female soldier who was patrolling the terminal from behind and put his gun to her head. He dragged her backward and ordered her two male colleagues to drop their weapons and raise their hands, telling them, I am here to die for Allah. In any case, there will be deaths.

As the woman, a reservist, fought back, Belgacem dragged her to the ground and tried to wrestle her assault rifle from her. The weapon passed back and forth between them. As he finally wrested the gun from the soldier, she dropped down, allowing her colleagues to shoot him dead

<TEXT> Yes you can lose upper range by increasing lower range if you push too hard. You can also lose upper range if you strain too much for it. That is why it is so important to get a good teacher. The damage isn't permanent but it could be if you keep doing it.

Also, I remember a previous recording of yours - your technique is all over the place so you really could hurt your voice if you push yourself too hard. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got diagnosed with depression myself just a few months ago but I must have an extremely different kind of depression from Plath because I could not relate to the book.

My own depression was brought on by years of childhood physical and emotional abuse. I had strict Asian immigrant parents and little things trigger bad memories for me. I lose my keys? Suddenly I'm a kid again and I lost something small, and my mom is screaming at me and dragging me across the floor.

Anyway, I guess that's why I didn't love the Bell Jar. People say you can really connect with it if you have had depression, but I found myself getting frustrated with the main character. Her problems seem so small compared to mine. Boo-hoo you have lots of options and you don't know which one to go with. I didn't have many options, I was taught that I was supposed to be a prodigy and that average was trash, and had spent years struggling with an extremely low sense of self-worth over the fact that I wasn't the prodigy my parents kept expecting me to be. It just aggravated me how she'd had it so much better than me, and yet she was just being incredibly selfish. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have read a lot so I do know what you normally expect from books that normally cater to those target audiences. My first publication (although an indie novella) was very much standard YA - 15-year-old protagonist, teen girl's 1st person voice, coming-of-age love story, etc. 

This second manuscript is harder for me to pinpoint because of the subject matter. It is not action adventure or a love story, it is about a screwed up family so it has a concise, melancholy tone throughout the whole book. Meanwhile, the girl in the story is so sheltered by her parents that she essentially has her coming-of-age in her early twenties instead of her teens, hence why I am leaning YA/New Adult. 

My best friend and my writers group love it and say the length is perfect given the melancholy prose style, my only worry is an agent being immediately turned off by the word count. So far, I have queried about 10 agents and one YA agent has asked for the full, but I am worried that other agents aren't giving it the time of day because of the word count. I have looked over the manuscript and I honestly cannot flesh it out any more without the overall story getting weaker. My worry is that an agent won't give it the time of day based on word count alone, yet at the same time I don't want to do any unnecessary padding. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the audience would be late teens onward. I've submitted it to my critique group and they really got into it even though they were adults, and yet I wrote it keeping in mind that kids would read it too. It's about the long-term effects of a screwed up childhood so the character has to age from childhood to adulthood. At the same time, the character ends up turning her life around so I wanted young readers to draw inspiration from it.

I am thinking of submitting it as YA, to agents who cover both YA and adult fiction. Then if they choose to bump it up to adult fiction that'll work too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So when I was 6, I went up to my mom when she was sitting on the toilet. She stood up to flush and I saw there was menstrual blood in the toilet.

I panicked and I asked why there was blood in the toilet, and was it because my dad spanked her too. She thought it was so ridiculous it was funny, so just to troll me she said yes.

I then went to school and told the other kids that my dad hit my mom, and my first grade teacher called my mom for a parent-teacher conference out of concern. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Would you consider this book YA or New Adult (or even just Adult)? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-12 07:59:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So the story's about a little girl from a screwed up family whose childhood friend commits suicide. Over the course of the book she goes from 7 to late twenties, although for the bulk of the book she's 9 to 23.

It's first person from her perspective, and the prose is in the style of middle grade fiction. No drugs, no sex.

Text Samples (age 9):

Halfway through the fourth grade, Mrs. Schwaltz gave us a math assignment.

Its going to be a little harder than what you are used to, she warned us, so you can find a partner and work together.

I glanced over at Justin, since he had always been my partner for previous projects. Justin continued to watch the teacher.

Once Mrs. Schwaltz gave the okay, the other students began partnering up. I stayed at my desk, my eyes fixated on the back of Justins head.

Now hell have to talk to me, I thought to myself. I waited.

Instead, Justin turned to the Kevin Vazquez. Hey Kevin, wanna be my partner?

Sure, said Kevin Vazquez.

I felt a slight twang of pain inside.


Second text sample (main character in late twenties):

My aunt sighed. Why cant you just be happy with what you have, Emilia? Why do you have to search for shortcomings?

I wondered why she expected me to turn out any differently.

Just look how far youve come in the past six years, my aunt continued. Look how much you have grown as a person.

I thought about it. I felt guilty.

Why guilty?

I think of Justin. He needed help like I did, only no one was there to help him.

My aunt sighed. Justins suicide opened your mothers eyes. She realize that it was possible for a child to suffer depression and she needed to see things from your perspective. 

A child. The term made me angry. He was twenty-three. How was he a child?

Anyway, the reason I really need to know is because my current word count is fine for YA (58k), a bit low for New Adult, and too low for Adult. It's completely readable for both a teen and an adult. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, I think it is possible for too much to go on if there is no sense of progress.

If you have ever seen the show Heroes, it tanked during Season 3 due to the writers' strike. That is when a bunch of non-writers went in and did a bunch of ridiculous stuff to try to keep the story going with no sense of story construction. Suddenly, Sylar (the bad guy) turns good. Oh wait, he's bad again. No, he is getting redeemed by a girlfriend. Oh wait, he kills her and goes full-on bad! The plot had all action, no arc. </TEXT>

He let go of my dog to dodge it and I scooped my (still screaming dog) up and carried him a few feet away while the German Shepherd's owner, a girl of about 10/11, restrained her dog.

My dog just screamed repeatedly even after I set him down on all fours, but luckily there was no permanent damage. I think the German Shepherd was just trying to show dominance.

I did choir for a year in college and two years as an adult, otherwise I only started voice lessons last December. My voice teacher used to sing light opera on stage so even she may not be a legit opera singer. She just gave me the aria for fun, mixed in with musical theater stuff like Don't Cry for Me Argentina. I know a lot of people here were questioning why my voice teacher gave me that song and said my voice was completely wrong for it. </TEXT>

That one song from Hairspray that the 4 kids sing about love. The lyrics between Seaweed and Penny annoy me:

Him: living in the ghetto, black is everywhere you go, who'd have thought Id love a girl with skin as white as winter snow

Her: In my ivory tower life was just a hostess snack, but now Ive tasted chocolate and Im never going back

I hear that and I go...are they seriously singing about each other's races? Like I get it is an interracial couple but they are actually singing about each other's races? Really?

<TEXT> You are 100% right - I know that of my 17 book sales, 12 are sales I already knew about (my manager from my day job, family friends, etc.). It seems that there was 0 marketing behind my book from the publisher's part - my book is practically self-published except I didn't have to pay. Several people who saw the book cover says the cover is extremely off-putting, it looks crazy low budget and a stock photo would have been much better.

Trying to get my next book picked up by a lit agent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since my story is from the 1st person POV of a little girl and she is a kid/teen for the first half and in her early twenties for the majority of the second half, it probably could pass as YA but I didn't want to put it in a box because there is a lot of social commentary as well. I guess if the word count is a huge deal then I would call it YA but I think a more appropriate label is New Adult. I know literary fiction can sometimes be as short as 40k so I was originally worried it was too long lol.

I might be able to add another 8-9k to the word count, but I don't think I could put more than that without it hurting the story. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello, thank you for your feedback. I will definitely change up the synopsis because the length of it was making me question it as well.

As for length, I read that while most adult fiction is in the 70-80k range, literary fiction can be significantly shorter and my book is definitely more literary-leaning than commercial. I don't want to force in extra scenes/sentences that weaken the story just to meet the ideal word count, you know? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well the inside stories have to be relevant to the bigger story. For example, The Joy Luck Club is a story about a mom dying and the daughter finding out she has sisters in China. It then breaks down into smaller subplots to show you the rest of the community, where the daughters' stories reflect the main daughter's life and the mothers' stories reflect the main mother's life.

Orange Is the New Black is also stories within a story. The main story arc being Piper's and the substories fleshing out that universe.

<TEXT> So I joined a local writer's guild fairly recently and have only been to 2 critiques. The writers are all either unpublished or self-published, and everyone else is over 40...except for a former classmate of mine who is there.

One day, my former classmate wasn't there. Then one of the old guys (he must be in his 50s or 60s) started talking smack about her. He said that she was really negative towards his writing, as if hers was a lot better, but that when it came time for her to be critiqued he expected something amazing since she was such a hardass on him, and he was surprised by how mediocre her writing was.

Now, that girl and I had taken creative writing classes in college and it was normal to be a hardass. In fact, she was much more gentle at critiquing than I was lol. Since I have only just joined the group I just mention the one or two things that I thought they did a good job on and if there are several things I don't like I will only point out the most obvious one and say it carefully. So far they like me lol.

What are your own thoughts on this? By the way I tried joining another critique group and this one is SO much better than the other one - everyone has at least semi-decent prose. </TEXT>

With my latest manuscript I sent it to just one agent in November, waited a month, and then saw he doesn't accept email queries, whoops! Then I sent it to just 3 or 4 more agents in December, got 1 full request and 2 rejections, 1 no response. Sent 3 more queries in this past week.

<TEXT> Well for actors they can get away with not doing a ton of research because the script is already written and there is someone else directing it. When you're the writer though, it's your own story.

I don't think there is such a thing as too much research. Alex Haley spent, what, 9 years doing the research needed to write Roots? I have a novella that takes place during the Trojan War and I did the motherload of research (I was already obsessed with the Trojan War but I turned the dial up to a 10 when writing it) - I made sure every plant and animal mentioned would have existed in that time and region, made sure it was realistic for a character to travel from one city to another in X number of days, made sure the items were made out of the exact type of materials that they would have been made up of historically during that time.

I don't think there can be too much research when you're on a topic like historical or science fiction, you gain a ton of respect from your reader when you know your stuff. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Harry Potter fanfiction. Look for an R rated pairing, maybe Harry/Voldemort.

But on a more serious level, please don't write rape/abuse scenes for shock value. First of all, there are actual victims of rape or people who know victims of rape who would not want to see something like that. Second of all, it's kind of trashy to make that entertainment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone who finally sucked it up and took lessons after years of singing on my own, I find that my teacher notices bad habits I have been doing for years without noticing. For example, I don't position my voice exactly where it should be resonating. Having a teacher watch you and point stuff out every time you are doing it wrong gives you a new perspective that you may not have before. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I majored in Creative Writing. Graduated with no job lined up, moved back in with my mom who screamed at me for being a failure every day (and since she worked at home and I couldn't find a job that was pretty much once every hour I was awake. I had to sit at my desk and stare at a computer looking for jobs, not allowed to get up. If I stood up to stretch and the chair moved on the hardwood floor, my mom would hear it from the other room and demand why I got up.

Went on for 6 months, got a mental breakdown, went for a long walk in the rain, posted about this a couple times before here. Eventually my dad in China (parents are divorced) offered to pay for me to study abroad and I was so desperate to get away from my mom that I took the offer even though I had no desire to study Chinese in mainland china.

But the program was good - there are lots of job opportunities for native English teachers so first I tutored little Chinese kids, then I taught writing weekly reports to software engineers, and finally I took a job working for a mobile game company as an English localization editor. I studied/worked in China for 3 years, then moved back to the US and got a job proofreading manuals since I got some work experience. I got promoted from within the company by volunteering constantly for more work, and learned lots of programs on the job. Now I am a data visualization expert/salesforce admin for my company. I am 28 now.

Oh and I am not on speaking terms with my mom anymore. She did some fucked up stuff to me over the years that could have gotten her put in jail. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think it's about the query letter itself so much as who the query is addressed to. Some agents won't take science fiction, no matter how good it is, because they just don't care about the genre. A quick Google search can bring up what a specific agent is looking for. It'll be on their agency website, an agency listing, an interview, and so on. If the writer queried an agent without knowing what they represented, it would show the writer didn't do their research. </TEXT>

I'm the only Chinese-American (or hell, the only non-WASP) of the group and immediately I noticed that there were Korean surnames mixed in with Chinese surnames, Chinese pet names mixed with formal names, and the characters spoke in ridiculous sentences like "I am sorry I arrived late, I have many dreams in the night." 

I pointed out that no one talked like that, if you're going to have characters speak in another language then at least don't make up fake exotic speech patterns--this isn't the Dothraki it's a real group of people with real languages. Anyway, it's surprising how dense some people can be when writing about other groups so I understand the need for sensitivity readers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It would be young adult supernatural. Lots of books cross genres.

But it would be a tough sell, because your young adult novel features a supernatural romance, and yet the main character is male. It is hard to tell if your targeted audience is teen girls or teen boys. Teen boys would be turned off because of the girly aspects (not to mention they get turned off from reading anything not in graphic novel/comic format in general) and teen girls will be turned off when it's following a male protagonist. </TEXT>

For that to happen the writer has to prove they are professional, dedicated, and that they understand the market.

That being said, it is interesting to see why agents reject books. Sometimes honestly is helpful. I think the best piece of advice I've ever read on a literary agent's site was, "If the premise has already been done before and done better, then we're not interested." I think that says a lot about how the publishing market is a market like any other, and if you don't offer something that fills a niche then they won't be interested. </TEXT>

Basically my parents know I have dated: 1 mainland Chinese software engineer, 1 Asian-American post-college student with Hong Kong parents, 1 college student who was half Thai half white, 1 white college student, 1 Hispanic college student, and one white guy who worked part time customer service. Race hasn't really been an issue so much as stuff like the guy's socio-economic status. My mom didn't like the Hispanic guy even though he was so nice to her and did all sorts of favors for her around the house. She thought he talked too much and hated the fact he was 2 years younger than me. Dad hated the mainland Chinese guy because he was convinced anyone Mainland Chinese who was interested in me MUST be after a greencard because I am not pretty (dad's words). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lets look at elephants, because it's actually happening to them.

Most elephants have tusks. Once in a while an elephant is born missing tusks The way some babies are born missing arms or legs.

Then came poachers. Poachers started killing off elephants with tusks to get ivory. They kill elephants in the thousands. All those young elephants therefore did not get to live long enough to mate and pass on their genes. Nowadays a large percentage of elephants do not have tusks because the ones that died were killed off.

As for humans, that happened too with smallpox. Smallpox was rampant in Europe several hundred years ago, and when all the other people died from it, the lucky few who were immune passed on their genes. That's why they accidentally wiped out most of the Native Americans, who lived far from one another and didn't have the chance to do that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 28/F, taken voice lessons for 2 months now, 2 years of choir

Think of Me from Phantom. By the way I notice that if I listen to it with earphones my voice jets out really shrill every so often but no shrillness when I play it open audio. Sometimes when I sing my high notes sound shrill to my own ears, I wonder if they sound shrill to people around me.

<TEXT> Hold on. How long did you talk to him before you invited him over? I re-read your post and it sounds like you'd met him on a Saturday, left him alone in your apartment on a Monday, and that's what happened. If it all happened over the course of 2 days I could see how you got scammed (invited a guy who was always a thief, he's alone in an apartment with sweet stuff, he jacks it all). If it happened over a longer period of time it wouldn't make sense for him to be manipulative because it just wouldn't be worth anyone's time to catfish a regular person who could be just as broke as them, you know?

Personally I wouldn't invite someone over to my house at all for the first couple dates because they could easily be a rapist/murderer. I'd have to know them for a while to get a vibe for whether or not I'd let them into my place. Then even longer before I'd let them have the key to the place.

I'm sorry you had to learn that the hard way, but as long as you take more precautions you can avoid it in the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can get better as long as you have a good ear. I read Pavarotti's biography and he said that his father had a remarkable voice and that everyone who knew him said he had gotten his voice from his dad, but the dad just didn't have a good ear to tell whether he was off pitch or not. Pavarotti DID have the ear, as well as an outgoing personality (that dad got stagefright easily), so that's why Pavarotti became a famous opera singer while his dad was a baker who only sung as a hobby.

Also I definitely feel an improvement compared to when I started lessons 2 months ago. </TEXT>

Got caught doing it when I was very young, my parents called it "the bad thing" and if they couldnt find me they would glare at me and ask me if I were doing the bad thing again. They made it sound inhumane, that sexual desires were some sick thing that only horrific people experienced and growing up I felt so ashamed of myself. Didn't know it was normal until I was reading an article online at age 12. Thank you, internet. </TEXT>

My dad is a math genius but a total narcissist, my mom is average intelligence and just worked really hard to the point she seems not fully human. She can sit in the same desk for 7 hours straight, get up to get something to eat, and sit down for 7 hours again. She expected me to be the same and drives me crazy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe I am getting a little ahead of myself, but I wrote a novel and submitted it to a couple literary agents and one has asked for my full manuscript. So now I am in the waiting period, not getting my hopes up too much but crossing my fingers.

I think that in the scenario that she does choose to represent me, I would like to publish under a pseudonym because the book is about a girl with abusive immigrant parents who dealt with depression as an adult because of it, and it is pretty much just a fictionalized version of my own life and family problems. I made lots of changes like parents' occupation, names, made up fictional friends to play interactions off of, but the core of the story is there.

So I need to chose a name that can't be mistaken for my real name, but 1) has to reflect my ethnic background and 2) I can't simply assign myself a stranger's name I have no connection to.

 I was thinking the pseudonym should be the main character's name, to mimick an autobiography since that is pretty much what it is. I don't know if that is allowed though. Other option is to pick a random first name I don't feel any connection to and use my mom's (very common) maiden name as a last name.

Anyone have experience in these sorts of things?

<TEXT> Don't worry, I don't see you as a slut. I don't even see Monica Lewinsky as a slut. Just young and naive.

But here is the thing: you are the one getting screwed over, not him. He already has a family, and he is having fun on the side too. You, on the other hand, are the one who is getting screwed over because you are spending your time with invested in him and not someone else.

If things go sour, he can just pretend it never happened. You, on the other hand, could lose your job. This is a man who is clearly a bad husband, so ask yourself why you want someone when if you had him you know he would cheat on you with someone else. His wife is someone that he had, probably not even that long ago, wanted to marry.

If his wife doesn't know about the fair then he is obviously lying to her, and this is a woman he once loved. So ask yourself, wouldn't he do that to you? So many girls before you have been in your exact position, we all want to think we are the rare exception but the fact of the matter is that this guy isn't even making the effort to work on his marriage to a woman he had proposed to and has children with. </TEXT>

I saw a beautiful leather recliner, but jumped back when the owner said it was $800. He then said it was half off, and if I bought it that day it would be $350 with free delivery. The sudden drop in price excited me so much I bought it.

Then several months llater I walked by the store and it was still open, same "everything must go" signs. I realized it was a fake sale and they had it like that just to trick someone like me :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> It kills creativity. Great things come from creative minds expanding on each other. Look at Greek mythology, so many people expanded on each others' stories to create epic stories that span multiple generations per family tree. People like Shakespeare borrowed elements from all sorts of old mythology/history, same goes for a more modern example like Harry Potter.

Now thanks to Disney we pretty much don't have original fiction after the Wizard of Oz era/Alice in Wonderland era. </TEXT>

See, that's the thing. You don't think writing is important. To you it's just a hobby, to me it's not. I actually have published a ton of nonfiction (was a freelance writer for a big website at one point) but I never asked him to read that because that wasn't important to me. I don't think I ever told him about it. Writing fiction is different, you build your own world, you choose your own characters, it really gets inside your head. </TEXT>

After 9 months I asked myself why I was trying to get him to read a manuscript when something I felt so strongly about meant so little to him that we clearly had a very superficial relationship. Anyway that was a year and a half ago and I recently got my first book published, albeit the publisher is insignificantly small. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh yeah there was definite catering to a white majority, whether it be her choice or her editor's. But I didn't so much see it as normalizing abuse (there at least is no physical child abuse in the movie, I don't remember there being any in the book) so much as just forcing a cheesey ending.

The book definitely has its flaws but since I read it at a very young age when there was little Asian-American fiction it did have a positive impact on me in a sense of letting me know I wasn't the only one hurting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I related to June/Waverly rivalry so hard. SO hard. Especially the piano scene. God I hated the piano.

It wouldn't say it normalized abuse to me so much as it taught me I wasn't alone...that at least Amy Tan related to my situation. Although I only cared about June and Waverly, the other two daughters were completely unnecessary and only seemed there because 4 mother/daughter combos sounded more conceptually interesting than 2.

I get why Amy Tan seemed so anti-men, she said her father was abusive and she was raised by a single mom, something that I can relate to. My dad was a violent alcoholic and the only man in my life, so as a kid I remembered hating men and wondering why they had to exist. My opinion has drastically changed since then, but having a shitty father in an immigrant household definitely has an impact on you so I get why it made its way into Amy Tan's book--because that's the only world she knew.

The mom storylines were a bit melodramatic. Fun story but it was an odd combination of very realistic settings for the daughters and soap opera settings for the mothers. 

Overall I enjoyed reading her books when I was a teen. I did notice her Chinese wasn't very good though, she mixed Shanghainese words with Mandarin and didnt know the pinyin system. But perhaps that has changed - I saw a more recent interview she did in the past few years and she seems a lot more aware of Chinese culture now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That was my bad, I was responding on an iPhone last night and the screen was small so sometimes I hit voting options with my thumb without noticing. Fixed it now.

So if I work on the legato I should be good, right? My teacher said "this song is normally meant for a dramatic soprano but..." and she listed why she chose it anyway (length, tune, language). I'm not going to perform it live so I think it was just a practice song for fun. The other practice songs she assigned me were more musical theater (Think of Me, I Could Have Danced All Night, Aldonza, Don't Cry for Me Argentina).

<TEXT> Is it a bad first aria? I've sung Think of Me for her several times before and Think of Me goes higher (Bb, this song only goes up to Ab)  plus she knows I have sung Messiah and Carmina Burana in choir and so I am at least used to singing classical even if my technique needs work.

She says she picked it because 1) It's short and 2) Tune is straightforward, no crazy runs and 3) It's Italian which is an easier foreign language

I definitely see Gerda loved Lili until the very end, but Lili didn't seem to reciprocate that love after the transitioning started. Especially when there was the scene when they shared a bed and Lili insisted on putting a curtain between them. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Finally saw "The Danish Girl" last week. Mixed feelings about it. Lili seemed more crazy than genuinely transgender? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-08 00:28:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm not a big movie go-er but I love literature turned into movies, and therefore Eddie Redmayne has been cast in almost every movie I've seen. I loved him in Theory of Everything, Pillars of the Earth, Tess of the D'Urbervilles, Les Miserables, etc.

So I decided to give The Danish Girl a try. And while there were definitely elements of the movie I enjoyed (Eddie Redmayne's character imitating the movements of the nude dancing girl were very enchanting) overall the movie made Lili come across as crazy with a split personality, as opposed to being actually transgender.

1. I've met people who are actually transgender, and even before they come out you do notice something inherently similar to the opposite sex in their personalities. I knew a boy in middle school who was very quiet and always spoke at little more than a whisper. His very movements--the way he dipped his head when he blushed, the way he collapsed his hands together just when sitting down--everything was very feminine. By high school this kid had come out as transgender and you weren't really surprised because you saw the femininity the whole time. Maybe it's because the movie cast Eddie Redmayne, but all I got was that this was a straight guy who, in the beginning, was completely comfortable with being a guy. Who was perfectly happy with being a guy. Who was sexually attracted to his wife. Female mannerisms did not come naturally to Lili; Lili had to make an effort to learn them. It seemed like more of a fascination with mimicking femininity than actually being female. When the wife says "My husband believes he is a woman inside...and I believe it too" my first thought was "You do? What are you seeing that I'm not seeing?" The only time I saw Lili as legitimately female-brained was when she was selling perfume with other women. The rest of the time, Lili just seemed like a guy with a split personality who WANTED to be female as opposed to legitimately being so.

2. Lili genuinely seemed happier and healthier pre-transition. Happy loving marriage, happy body imagine, happy wife, happy social status. Transitioning into Lili destroyed all of that. Lili caused the wife a lot of heartache, was unhappy with her body, was ostracized, endured a lot of physical agony in the castration process that cost him his life. If this movie was supposed to make the audience more understanding of transgender-ism then it failed miserably. The message it seems to convey is that if Lili had just accepted life as a guy then everything would have been fine and dandy.

3. The wife character was much more fleshed out than Lili. You end up sympathizing with the wife, to the point you start seeing Lili as a person with a sickness.

That being said, Alicia Vikander did a great job playing the wife. Eddie Redmayne is a fine actor, but there was something all wrong with how Lili was portrayed. He could convince me that *Lili* believed Lili was female, but that Lili was just the personal of a guy who had slowly gone insane over the course of the movie. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Could be more than just family problems, maybe you have something like Aspergers as well?

But I do have a story about never learning basic social skills, my social skills were absolutely terrible and I always wondered what was wrong with me growing up. I only knew other kids saw me as annoying. In college I played World of Warcraft and didn't have close friends. One day I realized even people in my guild didn't want to play with me. I asked why.

Woman: Because you make us feel bad.

Me: How?

Woman: Like when we did Violet Hold the other day, we were wiping there for two hours and were already frustrated, and then you found out and said "you're still doing that? Yesterday I did it and finished it in twenty minutes!"

I had no idea that it hurt other people's feelings or irritated them when I gave myself a little pat on the back when I talked because that's how my dad ALWAYS talked, and it took a stranger over the internet saying that before I suddenly realized you have to think about what the other person would feel when you speak. That other people aren't just preprogrammed robots but also have their own thoughts and feelings when they weren't talking. (Yes that is how bad it was - I thought I was the only one who had my own inner thoughts).

The revelation kind of blew my mind because my parents have zero empathy and I just saw insulting people and praising yourself as normal. I was 20 lol ;_;

<TEXT> I was raised by my aunt in Mainland China until I was 2 and a half (my mom wanted to finish her PhD), and from my aunt's stories I was a very active, scheming baby. They said my aunt once took me to a nearby daycare and I hated it there, so I walked two blocks home by myself when the teachers weren't looking. My aunt stopped taking me to the daycare because they couldn't believe the teachers were callous enough to not notice a toddler get up and leave and that I could have easily been kidnapped.

Then my aunt gave me back to my real mom and my parents fucked me up from there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Growing up everyone considered me to be an uptight goody two-shoes and yet I was always doing stuff behind my mom's back because my mom was so damn crazy.

For example, wearing nail polish. My mom forbid me from wearing nail polish because she felt it took time to do nails (5 whole minutes!) and therefore I was wasting my time when I could be using that time to study. Once she caught me wearing nail polish when I was about 15 or so and she picked up the cleaver and threatened she would chop off my fingers if she caught me wearing nail polish again. When I was in college I would wear nail polish and then remember to take it off carefully right before coming home. 

And then there was every single other aspect of my life she tried to control. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Head voice is basically what female opera singers use. They practice in it a long time until it gets very strong. Maybe it isn't the genre for you if you want to belt like Idina Menzel, but that counts as part of your range if you are female.

<TEXT> I was the same as you when I started. I refused to sing in head voice because I considered it cheating and meanwhile I used my breath support all wrong so I couldnt belt. I hated singing in head voice because it was so breathy and out of control. My lowest note was an E, so one note higher than yours (although some people say it doesn't count because it doesn't sound very musical when I get that low). Eventually I learned to use head voice and now my high notes are typical soprano range. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ummmm your brother is CRAZY. That is nowhere near normal advice. And you won't get away with it, there are so many ways for cops to track you digitally that they will find this very post. Imagine what your daughter will think if you and your brother get arrested. And then there is the issue of killing someone in the first place...no. Just no. The very thought is fucked up.

I would recommend talking to a family   relationships counselor first on your own. They often have advice on how to get through tough times like these. Please do not ever badmouth your wife to your daughter, my parents are divorced and they badmouth each other to me frequently thinking they were hurting each other, but the real person they hurt was me because of the years of toxicity I had to endure growing up. I got diagnosed with clinical depression over my family problems in adulthood so that's how bad it got.

So the real issue is that she cheated on you. I get that you feel horribly betrayed and hurt because of it. But you are not alone - many marriages before yours have ended in infidelity.

My therapist had told me to try to cope with my own issues by writing a letter. Not necessarily sending it out, but writing out why it hurts you, what you choose to do with that letter will be up to you.

Lastly, I have been hurt too until all I wanted was to hurt someone back. I once signed a guy up for lots of spam emails lol. But ultimately it meant that as long as I was angry and planning ways to get back, I was fixated on him, you know what I mean?

Why is your wife cheating on you (not saying there is an excuse obviously but sometimes there is a cause) perfectly happy life and just selfish? Is she suffering from her own issues from her upbringing that caused her to be more screwed up as a person? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, from my experience even if you ask for a raise you will just get a percentage increase over your current raise. I blieve the standard annual raise at my company is about 2% or 2.5% - I once did a crazy good job and was excessively praised by everyone, including my own manager, CEO loved me, but my salary increase was only 6.5% even though I straight up learned so many new skill sets. Hell I even moved from being a marketing peon to business analyst during that time because of how much Excel/Tableau I learned.

Generally the real salary increase is when you move from one job to another. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-01-05 06:55:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So this happened to me a few months ago but I thought I would share.

I usually sing along to male singers pretty casually when I am listening to a song. I can go down to the D below the middle C so I reasoned I was practically tenor ranged.

I had never sung at a karaoke bar before and decided to try for the experience. I didn't think twice and selected I Wanna Hold Your Hand by The Beatles because I can sing along to them casually at home.

Well, I quickly learned that there is a difference between singing along to a song casually at speaking volume when you're home alone...and singing the same song on a stage, into a microphone loud enough so that it can project your voice over the music. I was going as loud as I could into the microphone, trying to push the sound out (a couple singers before me made it look so easy) and yet you just barely heard a faint muffled sound of my voice over the loud music. I realized quickly that it wasn't working but I couldn't just walk off the stage when so many people were watching, so I kept standing on stage, singing and singing soundlessly into a microphone for a very uncomfortable couple of minutes. Meanwhile everyone at the bar noticed I couldn't sing it out and started singing the song loudly themselves to try to help me out, and so the whole bar ended up singing along I Wanna Hold Your Hand. They were louder without the microphone than I was with the microphone. When the song ended they sympathy-cheered and I quickly got out of there because I was too embarrassed to stay. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I was born in Scotland, and my Mainland Chinese mom let a friend of hers name me. I therefore got a very unique old Scottish name that no American can spell. 

Then my mother moved to the US, and her friend passed away so I had only conversed with her through letters. So the only reason I knew how to pronounce my very unique Scottish name was because it was how my mom pronounced it.

So thanks to the internet, it finally occurred to me to searchYoutube for a video of how Scottish people pronounce my name so I can hear whether it was the legit pronunciation. Now I find out my name has a dipthong! I always thought you were just supposed to ignore the second letter! Man I've been pronouncing my name wrong my whole life. I don't know if I should correct my pronunciation from now on or just stick with the incorrect one because that's how I know myself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So what I liked about World of Warcraft:

-The class aspect (tank, dps, heals)
-Detailed graphics
-Magical powers like fireballs and curses, robes, all that fantasy stuff
-Raids/partying
-Warsong Gulch battlegrounds/PvP
-You could make pretty female characters and have them fight while wearing dresses (DON'T JUDGE, I NEED THIS!)

What I didn't like in games:
-Mind numbing quests, I prefer group stuff. When I played WoW I always tanked/healed and spent very little time solo-ing

I stopped playing World of Warcraft because in the later installments they made the game stale and mindless.

Anyway, any recommendations?

Edit: PC or mobile, I dont want to have to buy a console just for the game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I was talking to my aunt (mom's sister) and she told me something that I had forgotten. So if you've seen my previous posts my situation with my parents was REALLY bad, I was raised by a single mom who essentially tried to beat my ADHD out of me for many years, plus she did some other crazy stuff after I graduated from college, police got involved and everything.

Anyway, my aunt has been calling regularly to check up on me, and she mentioned this event:

My aunt came to visit me and my mom from China one time and my mom suggested we see a movie. The movie was in English. My aunt can't speak English so she had no idea what was going on. So as the movie was playing I kept turning to her and explaining what was happening on the screen. My mom just sat on my aunt's opposite side and just stared straight ahead and watched by herself. She and my aunt are the best of friends so it wasn't that she was ignoring my aunt intentionally, she just never developed that part of her brain that sees things from other people's perspectives. My aunt was telling me this to try to make me forgive my mom, saying my mom can't help being the way she is because that's just how she is built.

I can talk to my aunt for just half an hour and there's more of an emotional connection in that half hour than what I've had with my mom my whole life. It's crazy how my aunt and my mom have the same parents and were born within a year of each other, but they have such different personalities. I wonder if most of us are here because our parents just lack the empathy gene. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-12-26 19:31:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I cry on a daily basis, but it's always because of the same thing - my parents. When I am not thinking of my parents I can run around and sing. But the moment I start thinking of my parents/childhood I break down crying.

I was beaten regularly growing up and my parents had an extremely toxic, drawn out divorce on top of that. My Chinese immigrant mom once chased me into the backyard swinging a wooden rod at my head, and I kept catching it and she got frustrated after a while, went back in the house, and started chucking hardcover books at my head. I was actually a really well-behaved kid, I was in my school's Latin club and our academic team won second place in the state, I was a bookworm who was always reading, etc. But both my parents had PhDs so they expected me to be a prodigy and I constantly disappointed them by having a B average at school. They also drag me in between their marital problems, they haven't spoken to each other in years and only communicate once in a while through email, and there have been times where they have CC'd me on emails that go back and forth between them to show me how bad the other parent is.

Anyway, I got diagnosed with depression 3 months ago. My psychiatrist put me on 150mg of Wellbutrin. I took it for a month and still cried every day. He then doubled it to 300mg a day. I took that for a month, I then said I got headaches and nausea but I still cried every day. He still told me to try it so this is my third month on Wellbutrin. Same thing.

I don't think what I have is depression because I CAN get out of bed, I am okay as long as I don't think of my past but it's like this cloud that's always there and keeping me from seeing clearly. It is ONLY related to my parents. I am in a choir and when I think of singing I get really happy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I started doing therapy 2 months ago. I think my first therapist was really helpful, he taught me to stop blaming myself and got me to talk to a psychiatrist because he suspected I had depression. Then he got a new job in another city and moved, and so I got a new therapist at the same place and I don't really feel much of a difference since she has come along.

She basically has me talk about my parents until I end up crying because it digs up memories of some bad beatings I got or their extremely toxic divorce, and then the therapist says I am strong for having survived that, rinse and repeat. At my last session I mentioned I am usually fine and only break down crying when talking about my parents, and she told me to pretend they don't even exist for now.

Anyway, I don't see how it's going to help me if I am just digging up bad memories to make myself unhappy. For those of you who suffered depression and improved with therapy, what made things better? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I admitted to my therapist that sometimes I wished my parents were dead. She asked why, and I referenced this time when I was a kid - my dad never showed up at any of my school events because he said I was such a bad student (B student) that there was no point in him going. As the years went on no one at school even met my dad, and one day one of the parent chaperones asked me where my dad was. I didn't want to admit that he was at home drunk again, so I lied and said he was dead because it is easier to act like he was a normal dad who wanted to be there and just couldn't rather than to admit how dysfunctional my family was. And since no one there had ever met my dad they believed it easily.

Now I am not on speaking terms wit either of my parents and they aren't even on speaking terms with each other, and I wished there were some clean excuse for it rather than to explain how fucked up mu family is. My therapist said that maybe for now I should go ahead and tell myself they don't exist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I grew up in an extremely toxic environment. My parents are Chinese immigrants, and my dad used to be very successful in his home country hence getting the opportunity to be a professor in the US. But in the US he was considered a foreigner who could barely speak English so he kept getting passed over things. That led to him developing a drinking problem and when I was a kid he would regularly hit me for crying. Meanwhile my mom had her own issues. She would hit me and lock me out on the front porch regularly for messing up songs on the piano, that happened every few days from ages 6 to 11. I had ADHD as a kid (got diagnosed very young) and my mom tried to beat it out of me because I was a B student. Once she asked me to turn off the stove, I said okay but forgot, and 5 hours later we came home to see the soup was a charred hard black chunk. She forced me to eat it as punishment with plain white rice (it was solid and black and completely inedible) and watched me as I ate. If I couldnt finish it in one meal she made me eat it the next. It went on for each meal for 3 days before she finally let me throw the rest away.

My parents dont have normal empathy for other people. To give you just a small example, one day my dad visited his sister and she told him he could stay at her house overnight instead of booking a hotel. Most people would say thank you, but my dad told her, "see, that's the problem with people like you. You only care about the small money, you dont care about the big money. That is why you will never be successful." Neither of my parents can be reasoned with.

For a long time I just thought this was a cultural thing. But my mom's sister is nothing like that. If my mom were watching tv and I sat next to her to ask what is going on, my mom will say "stop bothering me" and keep her eyes glued to the tv. If my aunt were watching tv and I sat next to her, my aunt would turn to to me and quickly summarize what was happening on the show before I even asked.

I am an only child and my parents screamed at each other just as much as they screamed at me, so they also went through an extremely toxic divorce that dragged on way too long. Each badmouthed the other to me, and would say "You are trash, just like your mother/father." They also built their own little immigrant bubble where they didnt socialize with non-Chinese people.

Anyway, I am fucked up socially. I was considered weird in school because I never properly learned how to socialize, plus my mom had always emphasized that grades were more important than anything else, only trash girls care about their looks, so I would just roll out of bed and show up for class like a complete mess. The other kids avoided me because they thought I was weird so I didnt have anyone to talk to at home or at school. I read lots of books to pretend the characters were my friends and my favorite authors were my real parents.

I started dolling myself up more when I went to college, and so even though I had no social skills there were boys that liked me. I didnt have any feelings for any of them, but I dated them just because I felt normal people date and I desperately wanted to appear normal. I remember having a boyfriend who would come over and visit and then he commented it was weird I didnt have any friends to hang out with. I would date a guy for a while and then find him suffocating. The concept of being in a relationship in general is weird to me.

I was in my early 20s before I finally made a good friend who coached me to respond, "fine, and how are YOU?" instead of just "fine" in a conversation. That is how bad my social skills are.

Anyway, now I am 28. I work in the IT department of a tech company and spend my days staring at a computer screen. I then come home and hole myself up in a room and browse the internet. I do small things to be more social, like joining a choir and a writers group, but even there I cant talk. I just dont find other people relateable. Small talk comes so naturally to some people and I badly want to talk, but I cant make small talk at all. I feel like I never developed social skills during the critical period and now my brain has pruned off those parts in favor of other parts. Either that or I inherited my parents' terrible people skills. I want to socialize but I cant. It is easier to relate to strangers over the internet than anyone in person. I would like to know if anyone had the same problem as me and managed to overcome it, thank you for reading. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Started singing lessons for the very first time and I am not sure what to expect.

There is no piano there at all. She will have me sing popular songs from Disney or musicals to a karaoke track. She will burn a CD and have me play it as homework to learn it, and then give me the lyrics printed on a sheet of paper with no sheet music. Is she legit? I am just paranoid since I hear stories of some teachers being shady. The lessons are 30 minutes once a week. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So when I sing below the middle C, if I use my normal singing technique it just sounds quiet and airy so I do that thing that women do when they mimic a man talking, and using that voice I can go down to about the D or E below middle C. I've noticed I'm the only one who seems to do that.

Is my voice weird? I should add that when I'm singing higher, people say I sound a lot like Princess Jasmine, and then it DRASTICALLY changes when I get to the lowest part of my range.

Edit: I am female </TEXT>

Roughly 10 years later, my mom is all bitching about how fat people are in Chinese right in front of them. "Look at her, she's so fat and yet she's still drinking a soda" it seemed like she regressed with age.

Also when I was little, my mom said girls were just as good as boys (to counter my dad's blatant sexism) and now she always insists all women are idiots except for her, because she's like a man. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I was talking to my therapist about how I struggle with making new friends and we talked about why. I said it was probably genetic and I just couldnt change it, since my dad has even worse social skills than I do and insults people even when they are helping him. I said I am like a wall, where it wasnt until I was 23 or so that a roommate taught me to reply "fine, and how are YOU?" instead of just "fine" when someone initiated a conversation with me. I admitted I have an easier time talking and getting to know strangers on the internet than I do in person.

So she pointed out that when I answer questions with short answers, it makes other people think I dont want to talk to them. She asked me why I am always cutting my conversations so short instead of talking about myself. I said it was because I didnt want to be seen as annoying. She asked me why I thought I would be annoying and I said it was because I got picked on as a kid for being annoying so I want to keep my conversations as short as possible to keep that from slipping out (huge "a-ha!" moment for her).

So she said it's one of those things that I'd learned to cope with by shutting myself down socially. She asked me why I still thought people would see me as annoying now that I was an adult, and I said it was because adults are harder to read, they can act interested in what you are saying and then turn around and talk shit about you behind your back. She asked why I couldn't see things as genuine and it was because my parents would always be nice to someone and then talk shit.

She was saying that I applied stuff at home to the outside world instead of seeing that not everyone was like that. Anyway, just wanted to share. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since this forum is so depressing lately I would go for a funny story instead.

So when I was a kid, I loved chcolate malt balls. My dad bought me a bunch from Trader Joes and I gorged on them. My mom them saw what I was eating and forbid me from eating any more because they were going to make me fat/be bad for my teeth. She made me throw the bag away, and I cried. Once they left the kitchen, I went back and fished the bag back out. I hid the chocolate malt balls under the sink of my bathroom (I had my own). I would go to the bathroom to "poop" but really be snacking on the chcolate malt balls while reading a book.

I eventually ate so many chocolate malt balls that even looking at them made me feel a little sick so I didnt want them anymore. I couldnt just leave them under the kitchen sink forever because eventually I would get caught. I knew I would also risk getting caught if they went in the trash, so I decided to try to flush them away. Too bad chocolate malt balls float instead of going down the toilet. So I try covering them with toilet paper to weigh them down before flushing. It seemed like it worked.

Some time later, I use the toilet and it overflows. I call for help, and my dad uses the toilet plunger while my mom and I stand and watch. Then all these chocolate malt balls, surrounded by bits of toilet paper, come floating to the surface. My parents ask me what they are, so I panick and say it's my poop.

And now my mom is freaking out over the fact my poop is perfectly round little floating things and she insists on taking me to the hospital, and meanwhile my dad looks at it closer and starts laughing because he recognizes it's the chocolate malt balls he had bought me months earlier. My parents thought it was so funny that thankfully I didnt get punished that time.

Anyone have other lying stories they want to share? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Wellbutrin has me so sick I spent the day sitting in front of my trashcan feeling ready to barf. Advice? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-14 07:24:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I took it when I woke up, at maybe 8am or so. Within an hour I got a headache, not head-splitting but enough where I had to stop what I was doing and lie in bed with my eyes closed. Then the nausea set in and I was on the floor clutching a little plastic bucket feeling like I was going to vomit, that went on until maybe 6pm. Finally at night I walked around for a while in the park and feel better now but still can't watch TV or browse the internet because the movements on the computer screen made it worse. Even now at 10pm if I try to read a news article I have to scroll down the page very slowly to avoid getting dizzy.

I have been in Wellbutrin for a month now. During the first 3 weeks I took 150mg a day and it helped a little but not completely. Two weeks ago my psychiatrist upped the dosage to 300mg and it kicked in and wow I was feeling better than I have felt in many years. I noticed I would get dizzy if I tried to do things on my computer quickly but it didnt get bad until last night and I was bed ridden all day today until tonight. I have a full time desk job so I dont think I can work tomorrow if I am how I was today. Anyway is it normal for my reaction to be this strong? I read somewhere nausea can last weeks, I cant stand feeling awful for that long :(

I also wonder if my depression is misdiagnosed because what other people say about depression doesnt really fall in line with my problem. I had crazy Asian parents who put a ton of pressure on me when I was a kid, I would get hit and locked out of the house on a regular basis for messing up songs on the piano, also got beaten a lot for my grades. Some beatings lasted hours, where I was just curled up in a ball on the floor while my mom beat me with objects. As long as I dont think about my parents or my childhood I am fine, it is only when I remember something that I crash and cry uncontrollably. I feel it falls more along the lines of ptsd than depression but my therapist and psychiatrist both said depression and they are the experts, I dont know... </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mom would double the amount of time my teacher recommended I play for, so when I just started playing I played half an hour a day because the teacher recommended 15 minutes. By the time I was 11 I played for 2 hours a day because the teacher recommended 1 hour.

I was supposed to sit up straight and play the same song again and again and again. If the song had lyrics to it and I tried to sing it I would get yelled at so I couldn't do that. If I wanted to make up a song that wasn't the one I was supposed to practice, I got yelled at. Meanwhile my mom would sometimes stand over me and then reach out and hit me if I messed up the song too many times in a row. I would start messing up when she walked up to the piano and stood next to me, because I was so scared my fingers stopped functioning properly.

Sometimes she would even make this sound in her throat when I messed up and I knew it was a warning that I was going to get hit again. I usually got hit 3 times before getting locked out on the front porch, and when I was on the front porch I was so scared of getting hit even more that I would stand frozen in my position and if my legs started to hurt from standing too long I would just shift my weight from one foot to the other because I was too scared to even sit down.

What's funny is after all that I still wasn't that good at the piano. I was about to take the level 5 test before I quit, and after that I wouldn't even go near the piano for years. Now I have a keyboard because I am in a choir and want to learn my part, but I sure as hell won't be learning the accompaniment. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Renting a room out of some lady's house over Craigslist. We didn't sign a contract. Do I still have to give 30 days notice? </TITLE>

<TEXT> So my situation is this:

I rented a room from a lady over Craigslist. $200 move-in fee that I won't get back, plus $800 a month. Well, I paid her for the first month, and since then she got a boyfriend who is here pretty much every night. They have sex loudly, watch movies loudly, play music loudly, etc. until early in the morning. I haven't had a good night's sleep for a couple days in a row. Just last night they played music until 2 in the morning, then woke me up around 5 in the morning because of their noisy sex, and then then were up and about by 8 so I barely got any sleep and it's the freakin' weekend.

One day she mixed her antidepressants with hard liquor and started acting creepy, her boyfriend argued with her, and then left the house. She then went CRAZY and started smashing beer bottles on the floor and yelling "yeah!". I was up in my room, wide awake in my bed hearing all those bottles smash downstairs. I didn't have dinner that night because I was too scared to go downstairs.

So of course I want to move out. I already found a place. But do I have to give 30 days notice when there was no contract? Does that mean I have to pay another month's rent? We live in California by the way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So when I was a kid, there was another Chinese American girl in my class. She was my friend, let's call her Maggie. I went home in the 2nd grade and told my parents proudly that I had gotten the second highest grade in the class out of about thirty students. 

Dad: Second highest? Then who was the highest?

Me: Maggie.

Dad: Why did Maggie get a higher grade than you? Your parents have PhDs, do Maggies parents have PhDs? Maggie's a nobody, how can you do worse than Maggie?

After that my parents asked "What did Maggie get" every time I had to take a test, and I was a really honest kid so I'd tell them that either I got the exact same grade as Maggie or she did just a little bit better than me. Eventually I learned to lie and made up stories about how Maggie forgot to turn her homework in or got a C, lol.

Then my school had an advanced program for 4th graders and Maggie got in but I didn't, and I got the hell beaten out of me. To get into the advanced program you had to score above the 90th percentile in every subject and I scored above it in every subject EXCEPT English because my family didn't speak English at home. But since Maggie didn't have that problem my mom would go to the school and demand I get placed in the advanced class, the staff would say no, and then my mom would come home and beat me for it and say I publicly humiliated her. My dad had never so much as met Maggie, whereas my mom had met her maybe twice.

Now I'm doing pretty good for myself and I wondered whatever the hell happened to Maggie. I decided to google her name, and it turns out she designed an app that got featured in the New York Times, lol, I can never win. </TEXT>
