<TEXT> Yes I am on r/seduction and already I started a little bit getting over my self and being able to contact with strangers. but always terrified by the idea that this might lead to bed! where it will be extremely embarrassing, and all the self confidence I was playing is ruined.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Will look around for such option. however I guess  lasting long at the moment ( because of the medicine I am taking) is not an issue. even when masturbating it is really hard. it is really taking long time. so it might be good time to get "used" to sex :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally when I like someone I don't expect to sleep with them right away.

But eventually :) and It will be the same unless I look for another solution.

unfortunately sexual surrogate is not an option here. I would REALLY go with it.

<TEXT>  it is never awesome the first time, I'm not kidding.

I think that is why exactly I don't want it to happen with someone I care or I want to meet again. for that I am considering paid sex. </TEXT>

<TEXT> the number of things she is working on is massive :). and still a bit general the goal now is just to get me out of depression, before even finding the root of the problem. I am just trying to step ahead.

<TEXT> Well, I was never able to find out . but in general I am not very social person. however after starting the psych therapy I figured out that my problem was always that I am not really connected to my self ( as in I look to my self as if someone else) so i really never cared about my self. any how I am trying to change this and yes just recently I am trying to go to parties and bars and so, yet I don't have much of friends. </TEXT>

<TEXT> the learning curve isn't such that your second time you will be massively better that the first.

Maybe I didn't put it right, sorry. what I wanted to say is to get a bit trained on paid sex not exactly couple of times . the thing is with the depression, my self esteem is already low. and Its not easy to handle the embarrassment, otherwise for a fully healthy person with no self respect issues what you have said makes sense.
