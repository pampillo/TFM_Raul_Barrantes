<TEXT> I haven't finished Pre-Pharmacy yet, and I'm only doing two years, but for example I took college algebra in high school and thought it was a waste because Calculus 1 is the only required math. But then I noticed there is a good chunk of algebra questions on the PCAT, so in reality it probably wasn't a waste. Now odds are, we're in different states and plan on going to different pharmacy schools, but my advice would be to look at the breakdown of the PCAT and take any courses that are on the PCAT that aren't necessarily required that you don't know a lot about or need to brush up on. That's what I would do if I was in your situation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my patriarchal blessing, it says that I would need to know a second language for my mission. Considering I was out before I ever went on a mission, I can safely say that prophecy isn't coming true. It also says that one day I would "be in a position of great leadership within the church" And that it would be important for me to "remain humble during this time." The greatest leadership position I ever had was teachers quorum 2nd counseler.  And that was before my blessing. Poor guy must've accidently tuned into the wrong frequency.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be honest, I absolutely love pharmacy. It is 100% my passion. Medicine is fascinating to me. I think it's the coolest thing and most of the time people give me weird looks for being so obsessed with medicine. I just find it so incredible. I love knowing how every medicine works, what they do and how they interact/work together. And I love explaining these things to people and advising them on different medication. So, I know some people that aren't as passionate about pharmacy and medicine, but for me personally, I do love pharmacy and it is no doubt my passion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I came to this thread just to comment about your kids. There's still a chance they won't get ADHD, especially if only one parent has it. If only one parent has it, there's still a greater chance that your kids won't get it than that they will, but when both parents have it, there's a greater chance that they will too. IIRC, with one parent, the odds are somewhere from 20-30% that the kids will get, but when both have it, it jumps up to somewhere from 55-60%. But like was said before they will be better off than other ADHD kids. Because you're aware that they very well could get it, and are watching and paying attention and will get them treated as soon as possible if they do end up with it. I wasn't taken to a psychiatrist until my senior year of high school. And I didn't have my medicine under control as far as a good dosage and having my medicine prescribed all the time (do to doctors leaving the clinic I was going to etc) until well after I was out of high school. And it sucked. So I always tell my SO that we need to watch our kids very closely and take them in for treatment as soon as they start showing signs that they could have it, because I don't want them to have to go as long as I did having to deal with ADHD untreated, because it sucks big time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From my experience, it seems like the reason a lot of people don't think ADHD is a big deal is because the symptoms of ADHD are things everybody struggles with sometimes. Everybody has trouble focusing from time to time, etc. And it's just so hard for others to grasp what it actually feels like to have ADHD without actually having it. They don't understand the magnitude, that these issues are way worse, to the point where we can't function sufficiently, and isn't just from time to time, but is literally constantly, all the time. Just for whatever reason, people without the disorder just don't seem to be able to grasp how incredibly terrible and debilitating it is to suffer from the disorder.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you mean to ask if you should be taking ANTIDEPRESSANTS. From me personally, it sounds like an antidepressant might help you out a lot. But what I would defintely recommend is talking to your doctor. Your doctor is going to be a lot more help than any of us here. Talking to your doctor doesn't automatically mean that your depressed and need more medication. Talk to your doctor, tell him what you just told us, and he will work with you, help you figure out what's going on, and then decide the best course of action. That's what the doctor is there for, to help figure out what the best course of action is to help you with the things you're struggling with. Hope you get it all figured out! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I take 20mg of Celexa along with my adderall. And I don't take days off either. I take my Celexa at night and it does make me drowsy. I take it right before I go to bed. For me, the drowsiness never extends into the next day. They don't effect each other at all. It's been a great combination for me and I like it a lot. I've had no issues with taking Celexa at night and adderall the next morning. I would test it out, and if you have any issues, talk to your doctor immediately to get on something else. Hope it works out for you!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe this is correct, based on my understanding. Outer Darkness is for those who have seen God or an Angel or something like that, basically have been a witness to his exist, and still choose to deny the holy ghost. And I believe, if I remember correctly, that at one point, a prophet Said that the amount of knowledge it would take to to be sent to outer darkness when you deny the holy ghost is so much and so large that it's impossible for anyone to ever commit the sin of denying the holy ghost that gets you sent to outer darkness. So for is apostates, we get the lowest level of glory. Which I hear isn't that bad. I mean it's still glory. ;) So it's a win-win for us! </TEXT>

<TEXT> All of these things are based on something that actually exists. Like I said, you cannot imagine something brand new, and completely foreign. Your brain can not do that. It draws from it's own real life experiences. No matter what example you suggest, the base of where the idea comes from, the root of it, is always rooted in something that actually exists and is real. Picasso never saw a cartoony eye, you're right, but Picasso had seen an eye before. His cartoony eye is a real eye with slightly altered characteristics. It's not some brand new, non existent, from outer space thing he drew up. It's rooted in a real, actual thing that exists, an eye. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can change certain characteristics, like eye color and so on, or even mix together 2 faces, etc, but you cannot create a new face out of nowhere, dreaming or not. You don't realize it, because you don't remember the face, but dreams and even imagination when not dreaming, are constrained by our own individual experiences. You feel like you're coming up with something completely new, because you don't consciously remember the specific face, or whatever it may be, but the face is always based on and rooted in one you have seen before. James Cameron's creatures were based on humans with altered characteristics. He didn't create some brand new, completely foreign idea. His imagination changed characteristics, like skin tone, of humans. He drew from his personal experiences. Same with Picasso. His imagination changed the position of an eye on the face. But it was not a brand new, never before seen, non existent face. It was based in reality from his own experiences. He just changed characteristics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, absolutely. I felt the same way. ADHD has taken a serious toll on me. I absolutely hated myself and felt like I had to constantly alter myself because of my ADHD, which led to a lot of self medicating with various things before I got my ADHD consistently under solid control. But still at the time, if you would have asked if I was depressed, I would have said no, that I wasn't. But at the same time I got my ADHD consistently under solid control, I was diagnosed with depression along with ADHD and put on Celexa as well as my ADHD medicine, and it completely saved my life. It totally turned me around and noticeably changed my life immensely. It's like I'm a whole new person. Partly because my ADHD is under control, but also because the difference the Celexa alone made is absolutely incredible. You may have depression as well. It's not uncommon. Talk to your doctor. Tell him how you feel, what you just told us. Your doctor can help fix this for you, whether it be depression or not, talk to your doctor. He will help you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Forgetfulness is defintely a part of ADHD. I believe it is connected to the inattention and lack of focus component. You don't pay attention to what day it is or what you're doing so you do things like get ready for school on a Saturday. Or you don't pay attention to what month it is so you look for homework in July. Or you don't focus and pay attention to when you put your keys down somewhere so you can't remember where you put them. Everybody forgets things, but it's a lot worse with ADHD. When you don't pay attention or focus when you're doing something, it makes it a lot easier for your brain to forget whatever it is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is true of all drugs. (Which is one reason I believe all drugs should be legal, but that's another discussion for another time.) There's this stigma that drugs ruin your life, harm you, and make you stupid and unsuccessful. But the scientific data doesn't back that up. There are plenty of successful, smart people doing all sorts of drugs, not just marijuana, but people have this stigma about drugs because the stupid, trashy people are the ones that get caught and that we only hear about.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Even when I was at my worst, if you would've asked me if I was depressed I would have said no. I didn't think I was. It was only until I started my antidepressant that I realized just how bad I was. Now I'm not saying you do have depression. Maybe you don't. And I'm no doctor so take my comments with a grain of salt. All I'm saying is this. Firstly, go to the psychiatrist. You shouldn't be having any doctor other than the psychiatrist dealing with your situation. Secondly, I would recommend trying to get in to see a Psychologist and get a definitive diagnosis of what's going on, if you haven't already, because it sounds like you could possibly either not have ADHD and it's something else entirely, or more likely, there's something else going on with your ADHD that's still causing the problems. And lastly, start seeing a therapist so you can learn things to help you deal with all of this and you can get help with your struggles along with medication. Just my two cents. Best of luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let me add, that you are not even close to the only person struggling like this. I struggled the same way. ADHD was also destroying my life. My life was a complete disaster and mess and everything around me was falling apart. And I couldn't do anything about it but stand there and watch as my life just continued to fall apart and turn more and more into shit. It fucking sucks. And I'm sure there are plenty more people on here that can attest to the same thing. Untreated ADHD is one of the hardest and most debilitating disorders to live with. Again, it just fucking sucks. But it can be managed. Which is why it is imperative that you find some way to get to the doctor and get professional help. If you are still taking your medicine, it sounds like your dose probably isn't high enough or you need to be switched to a different medicine. It's obviously not working for you. But getting in to see the doctor, and explaining all this to them is the only way to get that fixed. Hope you can get figured out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was diagnosed with Depression along with my ADHD, and I believe my depression was caused in large part because of my ADHD. You sound like you very well could be in the same situation. You absolutely need to go to the doctor and get medication. Nothing worked for me either. Once I got my ADHD medicine and my antidepressant, my life completely changed. It was incredible. It was a life saver. I know you said you haven't gone to the doctor because of money issues, but you need to find a way. Hopefully someone else can offer specific things you can do to still be able to get to the doctor. Do you have insurance? Is there any way you could possibly get insurance? Like I said, you absolutely need to find a way to get to the doctor for help. Best of luck to you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To specifically answer your question, you WERE just being non-attentive, but I think it's safe to say that that's because of your ADHD. Most people wouldn't start fidling with the seat, while paying no attention to the road whatsoever, as they cruised down the street. And it is not safe for you to drive without medicine, but there are strategies you can implement to keep yourself focused while driving without medicine when you absolutely need to, like in this situation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Driving without your medicine is significantly more dangerous than driving with it. ADHD, because of the issues with focus and attention, understandably so, severely affect your ability to drive a car safely. Most doctors will recommend you take your medicine daily, even when there's nothing specific you absolutely have to get done, because of things like the danger of driving without it. The first day I tried not taking my medicine, I also blew right through a red light. Almost, thankfully I didn't, caused a wreck because there were cars going the other way. I've taken my medicine every day since. I've also been in 4 wrecks, totaling 3 cars before I had my medicine. So yes, it is significantly more dangerous to drive without your medicine, however, in your case, I don't think you really had a choice. You didn't have your medicine and you were on your way to get it. You just need to figure out strategies you can implement in situations like that to keep yourself focused and attentive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is very true. And a very good point. He defintely does need to learn to manage it on his own. And the best thing to do is to help him in managing it on his own. I'm glad it was said that it's not an excuse. I was going to say something about it, but my comment was already long. There's a fine line. People seem to automatically associate having ADHD to being lazy, not caring, and not trying. And that's not always the case. Often times, that's not the case at all. However, it is in no way an excuse to act lazy, or to not care, or to not try. There just have to be ways to manage it.  Like I said, it's important that you be there for him. Support is huge. And goes a long, long way. </TEXT>

Without medicine if there is any sort of noise I often find myself distracted and having to go back and reread things. Even in silence my mind wanders and I always have to go back and reread. It happens so often for me without medicine that reading is almost pointless. With medicine, when I can actually focus, I just focus on what I'm reading and everything else just gets tuned out and almost seems to disappear.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Untreated ADHD is a serious struggle for the person themselves as well as someone that is dating them. It can be a struggle for my girlfriend too even, when my medicine wears off. The things you described, as I'm sure you've found, are typical of people with ADHD, which is why dating them can be such a struggle. The fact that you researched it in hopes to understand and want to give it another try shows that you really care about this guy, and is a HUGE step towards making it work. I would just go to him, explain what happened to him, just like you just did to us, tell him that you understand things now, apologize, and say you want to try things again. Hopefully he'll understand and want to try again too now that you have more knowledge about what's going on. As far as what to do while dating him, each person with ADHD is different, but the two biggest things, in my opinion generally apply to everybody. If he's like me, he hates his ADHD and these things you described about him just as much as you do, so you absolutely HAVE to be understanding. Which you're already far down the right path on that one. You have to understand that he's not doing any of these things on purpose. He wishes he could do better, but no matter how hard he tries, he just can't. You need to still love and care for him despite that. Understand that this is how he is and it can't just change on its own. Encourage him. Encourage him a lot in the things he struggles with. And encourage him to go to the doctor, if he hasn't already, and get professional help. The other thing, which might be the most important, is patience. Dating someone with ADHD will not work if you aren't patient. Period. He's going to forget to do things. It might seem like he's not pulling his weight or accomplishing much of anything. You can't get mad or frustrated when this happens. Be patient. Like I said before, encourage him. Help him find coping strategies. Remind him to do certain things. A lot. Constantly. And, if he's like me, I had a really bad habit of getting frustrated when my girlfriend would remind me constantly to do things. If he does that, diffuse the situation and explain that you know this is how he is and you're just trying to help. Give him a to-do list. Give him specifics tasks you want or need him to do and a time at which you want or need them done by. Remind him periodically until the time comes. Or help him set up periodic reminders himself on his phone or something. All of that will help. The problem comes in when people don't understand and aren't patient and get mad when typical symptoms of ADHD show themselves. If you really love and care about the guy, which willingness to do the above shows that you do, it will all be fine. And while it can be a struggle, if done right, people with ADHD can be some of the funnest people to be around and date. Best of luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm the exact same way. Except my dry mouth is mild and defintely bearable. My mood is so much better on adderall, plus I don't frustrate the people I'm around nearly as often because I can actually focus and do things. I'm 20 years old and most people feel like they're babysitting me when I'm not on my adderall. And I also, which some people don't understand, feel so much more like myself. My ex-girlfriend and her family seemed to think I was taking it to change who I was, and that's not at all the case. I feel more like myself and a much better version of myself on it. I was also diagnosed with depression, which I believe was mostly caused by my ADHD, and I seriously, absolutely hated myself without my medicine. To the point that, when I didn't have it, I constantly felt like I had to alter myself, and self medicated with anything and everything I could get my hands on. Sorry for rambling, but yes, I agree. Adderall makes me more me.  </TEXT>

I get hardly any, if any, pull from it and it starts gargling and popping hot juice into my mouth. The only way it stops is if I change the coil. But like I said, each time I change the coil it starts doing the same thing shortly thereafter. I've been going through coils like crazy. Am I doing something wrong?

Like in that case, there's no reason to not make it a contraction, and it seems like it'd be easier, so why wouldn't we? In the case of the German girl, she was just doing what she had learned. And it's not incorrect in any way. Only someone that grew up speaking English in an English speaking country would know that it's not typically said or written like that.

I knew this German girl who learned English in school, and her English was really, really good, she just did a couple quirky things when she would talk or write. And one of them was that she would turn anything and everything that she possibly could into a contraction. Maybe they talk or write differently in Britain. It's not wrong by any means; you didn't type anything incorrectly or anything, it's just really interesting to me. Here in the U.S., for whatever reason, we wouldn't turn that into a contraction. We would just say "unless you have a really really hot oven." I don't know why that is, it seems easier the other way. That's it. I just think it's interesting and was curious. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Adderall XR Not Lasting Long Enough </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-01 02:50:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I take 30 mg of Adderall XR once a day. I know XR is supposed to last 10-12 hours, but I have a high metabolism, and medicine never lasts me as long as it says it's supposed to. So my XR lasts me about 8 hours. So it really only lasts me a shift at work. And so I don't typically have my medicine for anything other than work. So I can't seem to get much else done. On my days off, I have school. And my classes are pretty far apart. So if I take it in time for my first class, it's already wearing off by my last class. So I typically don't have my medicine for my first class. I know that Adderall XR doesn't go any higher than 30mg and that a common thing for psychiatrists to do is also prescribe IR to be taken after the XR wears off. However I don't know how I feel about taking IR along with my XR. Does anybody have any experience taking both throughout the day? Was it beneficial to you? How did it work? Also, is there any other options I could possibly bring up and discuss with my doctor at my next appointment in a couple weeks? Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do the exact same thing. Also to the point that my fingers hurt pretty bad and to the point of bleeding. I pick at my nails and the skin underneath with anything I can find, even a box cutter since I use one at work. No matter how many times my fingers ache terribly and bleed, I just keep doing it. However, I never realized this was something that people with ADHD do. Although I have noticed I don't really do it on my meds, until it wears off. And then I go to town. That's interesting, but to address your question, what are you afraid of your doctor doing if you tell him about it? And honestly, I don't know why you wouldn't want to stop, I defintely would. My fingers are in absolutely atrocious condition. And the bleeding and pain is not fun. I've never brought it up with my doctor because I didn't realize it was an ADHD thing, but I'm not sure what he would do about it anyways. And if you don't want to stop, for whatever reason, it's not going to kill you or harm anyone else, so I'd say just leave it alone and keep doing what your doing, if that's what you want. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was researching it, because I wanted to know what the chances are that my kid(s) will have ADHD. And I believe, someone correct me if I'm wrong, there is a significant genetic component to ADHD. Often times someone with ADHD will have a parent (or a close relative) with ADHD. Obviously that's not the only thing that plays a part, and oddly enough, neither of my parents have ADHD, nor do any of my close relatives. So it's not the only thing. I believe I saw that if you have ADHD, there is about a 20-30% chance that your child will also have ADHD. So it's still more likely that they don't, but their chance of having it is significantly more than normal. If you AND your significant other have ADHD, then the chance of your kid having it goes up to over 50%. (About 54% I believe). So there is defintely a lot more to ADHD than just a genetic component. But there is a significant genetic component involved. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unfortunately I don't agree with most of these. 

Players should be able to choose which way they bat. Not everybody can hit from both sides. So if you can, it's actually kind of impressive. And it can give you an advantage. If you can hit from the other side of the plate, and you want to, by all means, do it. Also, if you are better at hitting from the left (or right for that matter), do it. Hit from whatever side you feel most comfortable.

Hats. I don't really care either way. Everybody wears them so it's not like an unfair advantage or something. It's like sunglasses. Personally, I think sunglasses would make it harder for me to see and catch the ball. But some players wear them. If they want to wear them, then wear them. I don't see a problem. It's not a big deal.

Salaries. I partially agree with this. I don't like how the Angels or Yankees or Dodgers are good because they can just buy whatever player they want to, but the Rays have to trade away any player that becomes good because they can't afford them. However, salary is a part of the game, and it always will be, and I'm not really sure how you fix this problem.

Intentional walks should absolutely be banned from the game. They're a cheap way out. It's similar to intentional grounding in football, which isn't allowed. Just because a player is better than you and you can't beat them, doesn't mean you should be able to just bypass them. Either it needs to be banned or the consequence of an intentional walk needs to be more devastating.

Base stealing. Speed and base running is a skill. As well as catchers throwing out potential base stealers and pitchers holding them close to the bag. Faster players should absolutely have an advantage over slower players. If you have the ability to steal bases, do it. It's a skill that's part of the game. That'd be like saying swinging and missing at balls shouldn't be a strike because why should people that have a good eye for the strike zone and have good plate discipline have an advantage over those who don't. It's not like someone who is fast is automatically awarded second base. It's a baseball skill and they should absolutely 100% should have an advantage. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There would have to be more to it for sure. But for example, including runs scored by the pitcher in the game and games where 0 runs were driven in by the pitcher, but he didn't allow any runs either (but only if the pitcher got a hit), Adam Wainwright in 2014 would have had a Wins Created (or something like that) of 5. 

Maybe I'm going down the completely wrong path here. But I think a stat sort of similar, taking things like that into account, would be cool to have. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I think changing the ERA wouldn't work, but having a seperate Stat that is something like ratio of runs given up to runs driven in would defintely be an interesting stat to have. Maybe you do it like on a game by game basis. Like this pitcher gave up one run in this game but drove in two could be more beneficial to a team than a pitcher that gives up 7 runs in a game and drives in 4, and gives up 2 runs in a different game and drives in 1. If that makes sense. Maybe like how many wins he created for his team based on how many runs driven in versus how many runs he gave up. I don't know if that makes any sense. 

Totally unrelated side note: Should a run that scores on an error made by the pitcher count as an earned run towards his ERA? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've encountered quite a few "ADHD deniers" in my day. It has always pissed me off so much. The big problem, I believe, is that most people that don't have ADHD, for whatever reason, no matter how hard you try to get it through their head, just absolutely don't and can't understand what it's like having to live with ADHD. It just frustrates me so much. Untreated ADHD is one of the hardest disorders to live with. And here are these kids and adults having such a hard time, like seriously struggling, and it's out of their control, and all around them are people saying ADHD isn't real. It's something you get over. You can just make yourself focus, etc etc. And it just makes the problem so so so much worse. As someone that was diagnosed with ADHD and depression, which I believe was caused in large part because of my ADHD, I can't imagine being that person that's struggling so bad because of something they can't control while everyone around them denies that there's anything wrong and that they're just making excuses. It sickens me to think of the emotional and psychological toll that that must have on a person. I was in situation like that for a while, that I'm now out of, but if blows my mind, and makes me sick that people will do that to someone. Act like that towards someone that is in such desperate need of help and support. 

Sorry for the rant. 

TL;DR: ADHD Deniers piss me off. </TEXT>

When you mentioned it to anybody they automatically thought it was vanilla ice cream, but it's not. Vanilla is a flavoring. It didn't have any flavoring. It was just completely plain, no flavor. But like I said, I don't know that that way of thinking applies to everything, just some things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I also just want to add, don't be embarrassed of your ADHD. I was also diagnosed with depression, which I believe was primarily caused by my ADHD. With my ADHD, I felt like I couldn't do anything. It made me feel like such a failure. Like I was constantly letting people down and could never accomplish anything that I needed to. It's a terrible fucking feeling to go through life feeling like a failure. Especially when it's something that you can't control. Before I went to the doctor I self treated with anything I could get my hands on. Which just made aspects of my life worse. You don't deserve to feel like that. You're ADHD is part of who you are just as much as your eye or hair color. So don't be embarrassed by it. With that said though, it doesn't have to be such a debilitating burden all the time. Untreated ADHD is one of the hardest disorders to live with. I'll repeat myself one last time, it doesn't have to be a burden, but you can't manage it on your own. If you haven't, go to the doctor. Get professional help. Getting medicine and help for me was a life saver. It absolutely changed my life. </TEXT>

However, Axe is bought MUCH more often by men than women, and they know men don't care as much about whether a woman is being hyper-sexualized in the advertisement, and that it will appeal to them if they present it that way, and consequently, boost sales.

<TEXT> THC mimics a natural neurotransmitter in our brains called anandamide. Anandamide is normally responsible for boosting memory and learning, dulling pain, and stimulating the appetite. Typically, anandamide and dopamine partner and work together to control different pathways and other things as needed. However, even though THC mimics anandamide, it doesn't have the exact same effects. When you smoke weed, THC binds to your cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors. You have these receptors in several different parts of your brain that are responsible for things like short term memory, coordination, learning, problem solving, and unconscious muscle movement. When THC binds to your cannabinoid receptors, it gets in the way of your natural neurotransmitters, like anandamide, from binding to them, which keeps all the above mentioned functions from working normally. When anandamide is prevented from doing its job, the balance of anandamide and dopamine is thrown off, causing the typical effects of marijuana that everyone knows about, like euphoria and what not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As far as I understand, getting Vitamin C from anything, at any point while the adderall is working, will diminish the effects. Orange Juice is very high in Vitamin C so drinking a glass of it at any point before it wears off will diminish the effects. Your body is absorbing the adderall the entire time it's working. When it can't absorb anymore, that's when you feel the comedown. So getting any vitamin c during that will keep you from absorbing as much. And, at least for me, it makes a huge difference. I completely stay away from anything like that while on my adderall because if I don't, it feels like I might as well not be taking anything. I do take XR though, not IR so the absorption is different. But I believe it's still the same idea. Someone correct me if I'm wrong. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just don't get what the big deal is. I don't agree that someone who identifies themselves as a girl should be forced to use the men's bathroom just because they have a penis, but I also don't see why they've made it such a big deal. It's JUST a public restroom. Just go in, take a piss, or drop a deuce and leave. I don't understand why it's become this big issue. Frankly, I don't see why they ever became separated in the first place, but for Christ's sake, you're just using the bathroom. Calm down. Both sides, in my opinion, just seem unnecessary. </TEXT>

Also, Whitney's miltank. I've never known anyone that uses a miltank competitively, and with a little bit of forethought, it can be beaten, however, it still pissed me off beyond belief. 

Also, Kangaskhan and Wash Rotom. Two of the most annoying pokemon I've ever faced, yet I would have never guessed them to be so strong. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, like I said, lowering your dose might help some, or Strattera, the only non-stimulant approved by The FDA for treatment of ADHD, wouldn't make you sweat. The other thing would be if you were able to get the same effects as your adderall dose from a smaller dose of a different medicine. But you'll have to talk to your doctor about that and it'll basically be trial and error finding something. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have had a somewhat similar experience. I didn't like having to take multiple pills when I was on IR either, but even though I'm close to underweight, my doctor didn't have any issue prescribing me XR. He just weighs me and monitors my weight each time I go in, and has said he'll take me off of Adderall completely if I drop too low. When I lived with my parents and we got in any sort of disagreement, they would say the same thing to me. It's annoying, but don't let it bother you. It's just one of those things. Just ignore it. And yes, since Adderall is a Schedule II controlled substance, it is illegal to carry it with you in anything other than the bottle you recieved it in from the pharmacy. And you can be arrested for it if your caught with the pills not in their bottle. Some people carry around the papers that come with the prescription, but that's risky. Some cops might accept that as proof, but some might not. What I would do is take the ones you need for the day with you in their bottle, and leave the rest at home in a different container. Best of luck to you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I took Wellbutrin for some time when the psychiatrist thought I might have depression along with my ADHD. Since Wellbutrin is supposed to help somewhat with ADHD symptoms as well as being an antidepressant, she thought it would be a good fit. Now, I never did take Wellbutrin by itself. I was always taking it along with my adderall for ADHD. But it honestly felt like the Wellbutrin was doing absolutely nothing.  I felt no effect whatsoever. It felt like I might as well have been taking nothing at all. So I wasn't a fan of Wellbutrin. Now, after an extensive interview and long, extensive testing with a Doctor of Neuropsychology, I was diagnosed with ADHD (of course), as well as depression AND anxiety. So now I take my regular Adderall as well as Celexa for my depression and anxiety. And it's a phenomenal combination. It has worked wonders for me. Much better than Wellbutrin. Anyway, so yeah. That's my experience with it. 
TL;DR: Wellbutrin did absolutely nothing for me. Felt like I might as well have been taking nothing at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is something that has always bugged me. I've noticed guys tend to dodge the question and not answer when asked if another guy is attractive. There is a difference between acknowledging that someone is attractive as a person and being attracted to them. Guys can tell when another guy is attractive. That does not mean they are attracted to him. Girls can tell when another girl is attractive that doesn't mean they're attracted to her. There should be nothing wrong with a guy, if asked or not, saying "yeah he's a good looking guy." This does not make him gay (which even if he is so what). Humans have the ability to recognize when another human is attractive, regardless of whether they're the same gender or not, and that shouldn't be such a problem or really have any significance whatsoever. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've never felt caffeine like other people either even before my medication. I've always wished I could, but I never have. So I don't think it's because of the stimulants. However I do believe it is because of the ADHD. Just like how our stimulant medication affects us differently than people without ADHD. Caffeine is a weak stimulant. So for normal people it works as such and keeps them awake and wired. So because of our ADHD, it doesn't have the same affect of waking us up and keeping us wired and so feels like it isn't doing much of anything. If that makes sense </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cortisol is a steroid hormone released by the adrenal gland. It suppresses your immune system, increases blood sugar, and speeds up your metabolism. Caffeine triggers the release of cortisol and too much cortisol can inhibit brain function and makes you feel panicky and stressed. Cortisol is at its peak in the morning to help you wake up. So that's why they say it's better to wait until later in the morning when your cortisol levels have dropped.  </TEXT>

Especially since how the low dosage has affected you, it seems like there's a good potential for it to be a good fit. Just tell your doctor what you just told us. That you can feel it, but that it's not helping enough and you should get a higher dosage. Hope it works out. Best of luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is exactly the same way I feel, and is completely right. High school would have gone so much better and I would've and could've done a lot better and achieved a lot more had I, and my parents, gotten my ADHD under control before I graduated. And I do seriously regret how I did in High School because I know that I was and am capable of doing better and doing more. But what's done is done. I can't go back and fix it, so there's no point in lingering on it. I just have to be thankful that it's under control now and do my best from here on out. There's not much else you can do.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This doesn't really answer your question, but as from experience, I'm a 20 year old with ADHD that I, and my parents, didn't get under control until I was graduated from high school. I was smart enough that I still made it through somehow although I didn't do nearly as well as I could have and I seriously regret it. The advice I would give would be to get it under control as soon as possible before his workload and school get tougher when it actually matters.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think it has as much to do with not wanting to over use anti-virals for minor infections as it does with the fact that anti-virals don't work on a lot of viruses. There's often no point in taking an anti-viral and that's why they're not as commonly prescribed as say antibiotics. Viruses are just a completely different ballgame. I was hospitalized with a very severe case of mono at one point and even though the infection desiese expert that was treating me said anti-virals don't work on mono, he prescribed and had me take one anyway just to be on the safe side. So I don't think there is any hesitation for doctors to prescribe them, there's just often no point.

Matt Carpenter 3B
Jon Jay CF
Matt Holliday LF
Matt Adams 1B
Johnny Peralta SS
Jason Heyward RF
Yadier Molina C
Kolten Wong 2B
Adam Wainwright P

I'm somewhat at a loss as to what the lineup will be and this is the best I can figure because I think they'll want to, since they lack power so much, try to get some of his power back by hitting him lower in the order. In my opinion, you could place Peralta, Adams, and Heyward in 4, 5, 6 in any order really. Maybe they'll move Adams lower down to remove some pressure from him hoping to get better performance? I just really am kind of at a loss. What're your thoughts? </TEXT>

<TEXT> My brother's response: 
"I completely understand that mindset as I went through something similar. I also, found the idea of God hard to believe. But as I looked at the entire universe, I also found it hard to believe that we human beings are the most sophisticated and advanced beings in existence. I also found the theory of evolution as the origin of species to not be completely conclusive although I do not find it completely nonsensical as many religious people claim it to be. I found myself torn between to beliefs and neither one was conclusive enough to satisfy me. The concept of God is still, to this day, one that I do not completely understand. But Ive accepted that I just simply cant. God is a more advanced life form. The actions of life forms are normally difficult and often impossible to understand and explain by life forms who are not as advanced. Surely animals do not understand how we as humans accomplish the things we do. As frustrating as it is for me as someone who likes everything explained and understood clearly, I have to accept that not everything can always make perfect sense. That doesnt mean we cant ask questions and try though. As far as the mall, Im assuming youre referring to the City Creek Mall in downtown Salt Lake. The church, partnering with another company (and without using tithing money), did buy and rebuild a struggling mall. The church has several investments which help them pursue good purposes. Not a lot can be done in this world (good or bad) without money so I see nothing wrong with the church being smart with their money if they use it for good.  Also, in doing so, they helped support the economy of downtown Salt Lake and provided who knows how many jobs. Major cities struggle when the economy struggles and the Church took action to help keep the inner city from falling into a state of poverty. If a government had done this, they would have been glorified. Anyone can take pictures of mansions and post them on the internet. I have actually met someone on my mission who had been to President Monsons house and talked to his wife there. She was completely surprised that it was in a typical neighborhood. It was a very modest house. My advice to you as that you research both sides. Of course you will find several things against Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon. I researched a lot of it. That has always been the case with the truth. People found ways to portray Christ himself as a bad person. But have you read the Book of Mormon yourself? Research both sides before making conclusions. I would suggest checking out fairmormon.org and searching questions there too. It discusses the accuracy of several claims. I have first hand seen the good the church does in the world. When the disastrous flooding hit Germany, missionaries stopped proselyting completely in the affected areas and began assisting. I have seen the principles taught in the church change peoples lives. Whether or not they are true, they have brought families closer together, they have made people happier and given them hope. These are not bad things. I have met some of the best, most selfless people in Germany and they are this way because of the principles of the gospel. The church teaches its members to go about doing good. And the church wants nothing more from their missionaries accept that we develop love for and serve the people."

<TEXT> This was my email to him: 

"At first I just stopped believing in God, but still had the mindset if "if any church is true, it's the mormon church." I just found the concept of a God hard to believe. Then looking into church history I found some troubling things. From what I've seen, Joseph Smith was really not a good person. At all. As well, there are many many historical inaccuracies in The Book of Mormon, and, honestly, it just doesn't seem to be well written. I know the church does some humanitarian work, but not as much as others. And they also do things like they just built a $5 billion mall and  the 15 all live in like these mansions in SLC. I guess the biggest thing is just the historical inaccuracies in the Book of Mormon." 

I really didn't know what to say or how to word it, so I probably didn't get my point across very well and that's probably horribly written.

<TEXT> Really delving into Matt Morris and 2003-2005, I'm not so sure that he did. I mean they did say he did on MLB Network, but I'm beginning to question. I think you might be right. Chris Carpenter joined in 2003. But an injury made him not pitch until 2004. In 2004 Matt Morris (only at age 29) had already declined significantly from his 2001 glory year. Matt Morris WAS the ace of the staff, but no longer was when Carp joined. There was such a big leap in Carps pitching from 2002 to 2004, so Matt Morris would have to have been one hell of a teacher and Carp would have to have been one hell of a fast learner. It seems more likely that, if he learned from anybody, that it would have been Woody Williams. But honestly, to me now, it looks more like many factors just suddenly allowed him to tap into his potential. 
Please correct me if I'm wrong, or if you have any other insight.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I heard them talking on MLB Network about the Cardinals pitching over the years saying how strong it's been. They said "Michael Wacha is learning from Adam Wainwright; Adam Wainwright learned from Chris Carpenter; Chris Carpenter learned from Matt Morris; Matt Morris learned from Daryl Kyle, and so on. It just keeps going back." That got me thinking, who do you guys think will be the one to learn from Michael Wacha, if anyone at all?  </TEXT>

Now when I read the quote I always see Joe F Smith looking like the awkward kid from a t.v show that's talking to the girl he likes and is just contradicting himself, going back on what he says over and over, always saying the wrong thing, and is putting his foot in his mouth. So I just see Joe F standing there red in the face, sweating, and shaking with this, scared, nervous, and embarrassed look on his face (because he knows he's making an ass out of himself) saying the quote.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see it now. 
"... a soul already in the Church ... is just a little dearer to the Father, if possible, than is one who is on the outside."
-okay. Kinda makes 'The Father' seem like a douche canoe, but whatever. 

 "Of course, the Lord is no respecter of persons"
-Um, doesn't that writ the previous statement null and void? If he's no respecter of persons then souls wouldn't be more or less dear to him based on their standing with the church, right? 

"but he [God] no doubt loves those who obeys his voice and who are willing to walk in his truth, more than he does those who fail to do so."
-what? Now he throws 'respecter of persons' out the window and goes back to the original point? If this is the case, then wouldn't The Lord be a respecter of persons? Also, this statement makes The Lord look like a complete dick hole. 

Another question: 
He starts out "...is just a little dearer to THE FATHER..." 
Then right after he says "Of course THE LORD is no respecter of persons." 
The way he says it he has to be talking about the same person/being, right? But 'The Father' would be God and 'The Lord' would be Jesus, though.........right? Am I missing something?

It makes no sense to disagree with either of those (according to mormon doctrine); however if I had to choose one, it'd probably be the "he wants some more" because disagreeing with "God loves Mormons" makes even less sense.

<TEXT> Shit my seminary teacher said today: 
(Copied my comment from another post)

My seminary teacher today said: "There are actually health teachers and doctors saying that masturbation is actually healthy for you and is natural. And that there's nothing wrong with doing it." Blah blah blah usual mormon bullshit. But then a little bit later he says "and if you want to debate whether or not it's healthy, whatever, but we do we stay away from it for health reasons? No, we don't do it because we're told not to. The prophet told us not to. When you're debating whether or not it's healthy, they can give you all the reasons they want that it's healthy, but all you have to say is 'I don't do it because Jesus said not to.' There's a difference in not doing it for health reasons and not doing because you were told not to." 

Well answer me this oh wise seminary teacher: why the hell does Jesus or the prophet care if I masturbate? Oh! And last time I checked "Thou shalt not masturbate" was not one of the Ten Commandments. 

*Quote probably isn't exact, but it's pretty close.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's odd. You must have Seminary as a class in high school? I have mine before school and the teacher is just a calling, so the get called for four years and then are released and also students shuffle teachers every year. 
My parents are relatively strict Mormons. I actually wasn't planning on telling them tell I was out of the house. Because when my brother told them, all it did was cause problems, so I was gonna wait. But then one day out of nowhere my sister starts yapping to them about how she doesn't believe the church. So now my parents think we're in cahoots and so they were really suspicious of me and were interrogating me. And so I just came out with it. It was a big ol' mess, honestly. 

Your decision is going to come down to which is going to harm you less. Your parents knowing that you don't believe or enduring 4 years of seminary. Things often go bad when a kid comes out to his parents with non-belief (from what I've seen) so if you can push through seminary, that's probably the best option.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't believe they can actually like kick you out of the house; however, they can make your life hell. You know your parents better than anyone here. How do you think they would react? I don't know your parents, but maybe if you told them what you just posted (about the nervous breakdown and what not) they would be understanding? Seminary is tough as an exmo. I'm in my last year of it. I don't know if it's like this other places, but I've had a different seminary teacher every year I've been in seminary. (Is it like that for you?) 


What you need to decide is this: 
If I stay in seminary, will the consequences be worse than if I tell my parents I don't believe? 
If yes, tell your parents. 
If no, I would wait till you're out of the house. 
Or if your parents are like mine and still make you go to seminary even though they know you don't believe, I would wait. 
Best of luck.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The last part was like this:
A=Know 
B=believe 
C=think I believe 
D=don't know if 

And then had a series of statements like (these probably aren't worded exact, but close):

Joseph Smith was a prophet of God that restored the true church on the earth and translated the Book of Mormon. 

Jesus Christ suffered for everybody's sins in the garden of Gethsemane and died on the cross. 

The Book of Mormon is the word of God and is the only absolutely correct book on Earth.  

ETC.

I found this mildly irritating. None of those options apply to me. The scantron had an E and an F for sure and maybe even a G, so where's the "know that it's not true" option or the "don't believe" option or even the "don't think I believe" option? It was mildly irritating that it was either know or believe, or don't know. 

Sorry for the irrational rant.

<TEXT> John Mozeliak said adding the the competition at second base is not unlikely. Meaning they still could sign a second baseman (or I guess even a 3B, but to me 2B seems more likely.) Anyways, there's a chance that the cubs will non-tender Darwin Barney. What do you think about the Cardinals signing him if that happens? His 2013 numbers were atrocious, hovering around the Mendoza line, but his defense is stellar and his 2011 numbers were solid. Probably unlikely, but just a thought I had. I don't know how I feel about it either. What're your thoughts?

<TEXT> It's just frustrating because the characteristics of a cult list had nothing to do with Mormonism. I came to the conclusion that it fit Mormonism after looking at the characteristics. But then they say that "I need to look up what a cult is, because Mormonism isn't a cult and it's intellectual dishonesty to say that it is." I DID look up what a cult was and concluded that Mormonism was one. Apparently, it would only be acceptable if I read a Church sponsored article on how they weren't a cult.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> And it is up to opinion. I think we both agree that Stephen Drew isn't great and Pete Kozma isn't great. It is up to the individual on whether Drew would be a significant upgrade. It depends on whether you want a worse (but still good defender) for better (but still not good offense.) I will say again I DO NOT want Stephen Drew and frankly, I would rather have Kozma for cheap than Drew for 10-14 million per year. There's no obvious answer to whether Drew provides a significant upgrade. As I said before, it's opinion and really is up to the individual.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> His stats, which weren't great to begin with, I agree, will most likely go down before they go up. I do not think, however, they will ever dip to Kozma's level in the near future, if ever. Signing Drew at all would be a mistake, but especially for long term. Whoever signs him will definitely significantly over pay. (Due to hype and lack of good SS both as FA's and on the trade market.) He is worse defensively than Kozma, but he is still a stellar defender and has a bat lifetimes ahead of Kozma's. Do I want him? No. 10mil (he will probably even get more than that) is WAY too much for a guy like Stephen Drew. My point is not in support of Drew, or the cardinals signing him. I don't think he's a great player and I hope to God that the Cardinals don't overpay to sign him. All I'm saying is he would be a significant upgrade over Kozma.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Drew-
501 PA, 112 hits, 57 runs, .253 BA, 13 HR, 67 RBI, 29 doubles, 8 triples, 57 walks, 124 SO, .333 OBP, .443 SLG, .777 OPS, 196 TB, 6/6 SB 3.1 WAR 

176 PO, 332A, 516 CH, 8E, 82 DP, .984 FLD%, -2 DRS

Kozma-
448 PA, 89 Hits, 49 runs, .217 BA, 1 HR, 35 RBI, 20 doubles, 0 triples, 34 walks, 91 SO, .275 OBP, .273 SLG, .548 OPS, 112 TB, 3/4 SB, -0.2 WAR 

155 PO, 397A, 561 CH, 9E, 98 DP, .984 FLD%, 8 DRS 

Analysis- While Pete Kozma's defense does appear to be ahead of Stephen Drew's (especially in DRS), Stephen Drew's defense is still remarkable (although that -2 DRS is concerning), and he did have less errors in more innings played at shortstop. While Kozma has slightly more assists, he also has more chances, and Stephen Drew has more put outs on less chances, Still, I agree Stephen Drew has a worse glove, but he is still a stellar defender. Based solely on defense, Pete Kozma has a SLIGHT edge. On offense, Stephen Drew blows Kozma out of the water. It's not even close. The only offensive category Pete Kozma beats Stephen Drew in is strike outs, however Kozma had less plate appearances, averaging about 1 SO per .203 PA, whereas Stephen Drew averaged 1 SO per .247 PA. While Kozma still has the edge there, it's a lot closer than what it looks like at first glance. Based solely on offense, Stephen Drew had a SIGNIFICANT edge. 

Final thought- Stephen Drew is not an offensive machine. His numbers weren't that great (and they will probably go down before going up), and I don't consider him that great of an offensive player, and I DO NOT, I repeat I DO NOT WANT THE CARDINALS TO SIGN STEPHEN DREW, whatever team signs him will definitely overpay significantly for a player that is not that magnificent. However, he would be a HUGE upgrade offensively at shortstop without losing too much defensively. He is still a stellar defender with a bat lifetimes ahead of Kozma's. Do I want him? No. Do I think he's an incredible player? No. Is he better than Kozma? HELL YES. Would he be an upgrade for the cardinals at SS? A significant one.

Claiming that I needed to look into what a cult is (what?) and that it's "intellectual indecency" (or something like that) because we both know Mormonism isn't a cult. (By this point I'm confused because I thought what I had been looking at was characteristics of a cult and no specific connection to mormonism; I just made the connection myself based on the characteristics. So was I not looking up what a cult actually was? Getting mad at me, but then telling me to do what I was doing?) anyways, they then Proceeded to claim that "cults have to shelter their members from the world to get them to follow" (Be in the world not of the world comes to mind). And that "cults don't have people working for Walmart and cults don't send the kids to public school"(again I say "what?") the whole time all I could think about was the characteristic of a cult on this list that said "they stop you from reading negative things about themselves." I just needed to vent. This sucks. Hold me r/exmormon.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's always been so frustrating to me that churches, the mormon church especially, can convince it's members that trials are a test of your faith and are making you stronger. A loving God isn't going to make your life shit "to test your faith" and "to make you stronger." Like my mom, a TBM, was diagnosed with breast cancer last year. (It was small and a double mastectomy made her cancer-free) Anyways, she said that at first she was a little puzzled because my brother had been on a mission for a few weeks and she thought you always received tons of blessings from your kid being on a mission, but then one day she says to me "I've realized that this was a blessing. I found the cancer before it had spread. The Lord was blessing me." She was actually convinced that her finding breast cancer was a blessing. WTF MOM. And then she was all "cancer was a blessing for us because it allowed us to see the hand of The Lord and increase our faith," through the whole thing. She got many priesthood blessings over this time and she thought they were so incredible because they would say things like "you will live to see your grandchildren" AFTER doctors had already told her that surgery would get rid of it no problem. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK MOM. It just baffles me how some people believe the things they do.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2013-11-07 15:38:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The Word of Wisdom has always been something that bothered me, even when I believed. As far as I know, coffee and tea in particular, have plenty of health benefits, and are actually decently good for you, so I never understood why we were commanded not  to drink them. I've always been taught that the word of wisdom is commandments that take care of our body, because "our bodies are temples, they're God's creation, and they're one of the greatest gifts he's given us." And so it's a terrible sin to misuse our bodies. But as I said before, coffee and tea are actually decently good for you. Also, it made more sense that God, as long as I was a good person (was kind, caring, compassionate, helped and served others, etc.), wasn't going to send me to hell because I drank coffee, I mean, come on, but as every good little mormon kid did/does, I just pushed all of this aside and ignored it. So now, I'm just curious if Joseph Smith every provided any explanation, at all, for the word of wisdom.

<TEXT> 15 wins and a 3.97 ERA is not bad by any means either. I was even guilty of this before, but am starting to come around for Lynn and see how good of a pitcher he actually is. I think, honestly, Cardinal fans are a little spoiled when it comes to starting pitchers. Lynn did have the highest ERA of any Cardinal starter that had regular starts. However a 3.97 ERA isn't bad, especially for the number 4 rotation spot which Lynn seemed to occupy. I'm sure other teams would kill for a number four starter with those numbers. Anyways, as I was saying Cardinal fans are spoiled. If you look at what the Cardinals rotation ended up being for the last few months of the season this is what we get. Wainwright, Miller, Kelly, Lynn, Wacha. Wainwright, Kelly, and Wacha each had an ERA under 3.00. Miller had an ERA of 3.06. Lynn as I've stated before was 3.97. As well, Wainwright had 19W, Kelly 10W, Miller 15W, Wacha 4W (but many will point to his one loss and the fact that he started much later than the others), Lynn 15W So when we, as Cardinal fans, myself included look at these 5 starters, it's easy to be disappointed with Lynn. Oh he's just a run of the mill average to below average starter. When we just look at these 5. If you were to put it all into perspective and look around the league I think you would actually be impressed with Lynn. To reiterate what I said before 15W and a 3.97 ERA (I know there are more stats, I'm just citing those 2) really are pretty good numbers, maybe not for a staff ace, but really good numbers nonetheless. Especially from a number 4 starter. There are plenty of teams that would love Lynn type production. It's just easy to be disappointed by a 7 sitting amongst 9's. Ultimately Cardinal fans should be happy with Lynn's performance.  </TEXT>

The time and effort it would take to chisel just one word would be ridiculous. Not to mention if you ever made a mistake. It just doesn't seem realistic to me. 
Also, on a side note, if anybody knows the answer to this question, please feel free to answer. Why would they have written the BOM on plates made out if such a valuable metal as Gold? Just doesn't seem plausible to me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is true. That would be a lot for a backup. Maybe the Cardinals can get something figured out and strike a trade sending him to a team that could use an upgrade at third, but isn't necessarily shopping for one? It wouldn't make the trade , but could maybe sway them in favor of it; put them over the top and get them to accept? Maybe I'm just crazy and hoping, that after all Freese has done for the Cardinals, he'll have a bigger impact than he actually will or can. Maybe I'm just crazy and all he is is a contract to shed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> According to White Sox writers, the white sox have interest in Freese. Or at least should have interest in Freese. Would they be willing to open up one hole to fill another with a Freese for Ramirez straight swap? Or maybe send Lynn over too to make it more enticing for a club wanting to win sooner rather than spend years of rebuilding and then get a solid bench bat or two and maybe a prospect or two from them as well as Ramirez?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Besides the fact that Garcia has very, very little value on the trade market right now, Jaime Garcia is the only left handed pitcher capable of starting in the majors for the Cardinals at this point. Just like for spring training for the 2013 season, I'm gonna say Jaime Garcia has a guaranteed rotation spot.  He didn't have to compete against Lynn, Miller, and Rosenthal last year, and I don't expect him to have to compete this year. On a side note I would say Adam Wainwright is the only other guaranteed rotation spot. As it stands now (players could be traded) I think we'll see Lynn, Wacha, Miller, Martinez, and Kelly competing for three open spots with Lynn, Wacha, and Miller being the favorites.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would definitely agree with this. I think Miller has A LOT of trade value. I also think The Cardinals would be dumb to trade him. I also think Lynn can commend decent trade value because as someone else commented "there are worse pitchers that have rotation spots" He's young, not too expensive talented and with the right circumstances could turn in to a solid 2 starter. I think this is a great time to move Lynn. Before maybe his contract gets higher and he gets older. He has great trade value and the Cardinals have younger pitchers ready to take the reins and blossom with a rotation spot. My vote goes to trade Lynn. I think Martinez's value is spearheaded by the fact that the 2014 could easily be his first season as a starter. I think a team thats on the cusp of finishing up rebuilding (a team like the Royals for example) would show some serious interest a guy like Martinez. I also agree that David Freese is not going to be worth much on the trade market. However I do think he could be a piece that could sway the other side into accepting a trade. I think it would be wise for the Cardinals to move him as his contract just keeps going up and Kolten Wong is ready to take 2B and Matt Carpenter can shift to 3B.  I also think Matt Adams has decent trade value, however, I think he's more valuable to the Cardinals than what they would get in return from trading him. Whether Allen Craig is at 1B and he provides a decent bat off the bench (an area of need for the Cardinals) or Allen Craig is in right and he adds power to a low-power lineup, I think he adds more value to the Cardinals than anything they would get in return for trading him. 
My prediction: Of the 5 players I listed (Miller, Lynn, Martinez, Adams, Freese) Miller, Martinez, and Adams will stay. Lynn and Freese will be sporting different colors come next spring.

<TEXT> I've always been the same way. I've seen all these people talking about how depressing it is and how you can't be happy not believing in a God and an afterlife, because without God life has no meaning, but I've always been just fine. Perfectly happy. Honestly, it's kind of better for me.  Now I don't have to be constantly worried about upsetting the invisible sky being and whether I'm going to hell or not. I echo the words "Life has meaning because it is finite. It has meaning because it doesn't go on forever. The Mona Lisa is worth $100 million+. Had Leonardo da Vinci painted many of them, it wouldn't be worth much, but because there is only one (amongst other reasons), it has an incredible value."  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mormon 9:1-3 
1 And now, I speak also concerning those who do not believe in Christ.

2 Behold, will ye believe in the day of your visitation--behold, when the Lord shall come, yea, even that great day when the earth shall be rolled together as a scroll, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, yea, in that great day when ye shall be brought to stand before the Lamb of God--then will ye say that there is no God?

3 Then will ye longer deny the Christ, or can ye behold the Lamb of God? Do ye suppose that ye shall dwell with him under a consciousness of your guilt? Do ye suppose that ye could be happy to dwell with that holy Being, when your souls are racked with a consciousness of guilt that ye have ever abused his laws? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I first stopped believing in God. But I still maintained a mindset of "if any church is true, it's probably the mormons." Then as time went by I discovered all the problems and holes in Mormonism and I became genuinely pissed off. I was pissed off because of all the lies the church was feeding me over the years. Day by day, even when I think I've discovered them all, I keep finding new problems with the church and it just makes me so mad that I was lied to and manipulated over the years.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One thing that baffled me, even when I was a believer, was citing the bible in the BOM. I was always told that the bible and the BOM were happening at the same time. So how does Nephi (2nd Nephi) quote chapters of Isaiah? And how does Lehi quote revelations from the book god gives him when revelations hadn't even been written yet? If there actually is a logical answer I would love to hear it. It's just something I've been thinking about.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My TBM mom, after finding out some things I had done, and after I came out, she told me she wanted me to repent with the bishop because she doesn't know how to "get a change in behavior without repenting and God." So she basically told me she doesn't know how to be a parent. At least thats what I got from it. Also, back when I was like 12 or 13 and believed, I copied and pasted some pictures of the first presidency, off the internet. into a word document, put them in frames and put them around my room. Well, this weekend , after comimg out, I was cleaning out my room, so i took out the paper, through it away and gave my mom her frames back. Well, she got super pissed at me because I "disrespected" the prophet. Its hard living with mormon parents when you aren't mormon. I guess I'm really just looking for advice.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I came out to my parents last night. So did my sister. Things did not go well. They took our phones and my car. Took our passwords for our phones, facebook, twitter, etc. Went through all of those things. We're basically grounded indefinitly. They're claiming that it has nothing to do with the beliefs, but that its because we "lied" and lived "secret lives". I'm 17 years old. I need helpon what I should do. It was even thrown out there of sending me to live with my grandparents. And they were even talking about pulling my sister out of dance (which is her life) because she "had to dance on a sunday a couple times and that must be a big reason why she doesn't believe and it's their jobs as parents to help their kids have their priorities straight." And when they found out I had been on r/exmormon and that I was going to introduce it to my sister they said furiously "And now you're going to show her an anti-mormon website!" so I said "It's a support group." and their response was "She's a 13 year old girl, she doesn't need a support group. And neither does a 17 year old boy." 
Please, help me out here, guys. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm 16 years old and I haven't believed in Mormonism for a little while now. My brother stopped believing when he was 14 and when he told our parents, all it did was cause problems. And for me if I told them, nothing would change. They would still make me go to church, seminary, mutual, etc. The only thing would be that it could cause problems between me and them as it did for my brother. So I figured I would just go along with things until I was out of the house. However, with the mission age being lowered to 18, I don't know how that would work out. I want to go to college and not on a mission, but they keep talking about me leaving as soon as I'm done with high school. I don't know what I should do since I was planning on not telling them I wasn't going until I was on my own. But with what they want me to do, I wouldn't get that opportunity. I need some help.  </TEXT>
