<TEXT> There's never a bad time to start therapy. I know for me, it helps me sort out my feelings and feel a little more sane. It may do the same for you. Sure talking to friends and family helps, but they're not professionally trained to help people work through anxiety.

Additionally, if you're on meds that aren't helping you then you should revisit your psychiatrist.  Good luck, and I hope you're able to enjoy your special day even through all of the calamity. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Daily Acid Reflux </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all. With my psychiatrist's help, I recently weaned off the Zoloft I've taken for the past year to help with my GAD and depression. I have recently started having acid reflux multiple times throughout the day from the time I wake up to when I go to sleep, with breaks during the day when I'm too busy to think about it. It's terrible and makes me nauseous. During my depressive episode before the Zoloft, I developed IBS but that felt very different.

I'm not sure if it's related to coming off Zoloft, a dietary thing, or connected to my anxiety. It's really been bothering me and my next check in with my psychiatrist isn't until next Wednesday. What do you guys think? Have any of you had experiences with something like this?

Edit: There is a slim chance that my digestive issues are being caused by Acticlate which I am taking for my acne, but it would still be nice to know if anyone else here has experienced this due to anxiety. My GAD makes me a bit of a hypochondriac and I never know what to believe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have had eczema all of my life.  Although I haven't had flare-ups in a long time, I used to get it on my eyelids.  This means I am especially sensitive to products.

After reading some posts here, I think I have oily but dehydrated sensitive skin.  I have never had this much acne before, and I have had some of the same pimples on my face for the past few months - they just seem to spread to other areas instead of clearing up.  I tried using the Retin-A Micro my doctor gave me a few years ago, but that doesn't seem to help either.  Nothing seems to work and I'm tired of having skin that is itchy and hurting all the time.

My current skincare routine:

Morning:
- Aveeno ultra-calming foaming cleanser
- Aveeno ultra-calming daily moisturizer with spf 15

I currently wear Bare Minerals liquid foundation and concealer during the day while I am at work, but am also open to suggestions for other make-up brands.

Night:
- Aveeno ultra-calming makeup removing wipes </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just went to the doctor last Thursday too and was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Major Depression, so I know what you're going through.  Haven't started the meds yet, but that should be happening in a few days as well.

This is my 6th year teaching and this year has been really rough in terms of discipline for me as well.  I've realized that it's hard to be firm and consistent with your students when you are being so hard on yourself.  It's impossible to demand respect from your students when you don't even respect yourself right now.  All of that will come with time and the support that you need.

I was also wondering if the doctor had recommended any kind of therapy so you can talk out your problems.  I'm supposed to be starting tomorrow, and the idea of figuring out my anxiety with like-minded people is something I look forward to.  If not, you should definitely look into it.  

Feel free to PM me if you want.  I'll be off work for the next two weeks getting used to the meds and going to group therapy during the day with not much else to do... </TEXT>

While I was teaching Kindergarten, I felt like I was doing something worthwhile when I saw the smiles on their faces and got hugs daily.  It means a lot to feel loved and appreciated.  

This year working with moody 5th graders and a co-teacher who treats me like her aide has just been too much.  I even have a parent this year who is trying her hardest to get me fired based on awful things her child says I said to him.  She claims he remembers everything and that I must be lying.  I'm so tired of the stress - from the adults even moreso than the kids.  It may be enough for me to consider changing professions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The therapist who diagnosed me figured out right away that I had anxiety.  I've been an anxious person for as long as I can remember, but it's just gotten worse through the years.  It was one of the reasons I was diagnosed with Major Depression instead of it just being a result of life adjustments.  Honestly, I'm excited to start therapy because I'm tired of being anxious all the time (even though when I get there I will probably refuse to participate or say anything). </TEXT>

<TEXT> The saddest thing is that I don't know if I'll be happy to go back to my 5th graders, and I don't know if they'll be happy to see me.  Part of the stress has been moving from Kindergarten to 5th grade within the course of a year.  I had worked with 5th grade like 7 years ago and had a rough time, but my principal pretty much forced me into it because she knows that every year the 5th grade teachers quit at our school.  Before this, I was a successful and happy Kindergarten teacher for 3 years running.  It makes me feel like a terrible person knowing that I just don't like working with 5th graders, but at the same time I wonder if that's the depression or just me. </TEXT>

When I tried going to people for help before and during the nervous breakdowns though, I got a lot of advice that I should just suck it up and work harder to get through it.  When I tried to express my feelings and be assertive, I just pissed people off.  Part of me just really wants a fresh start away from the mess. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Today I was diagnosed with an episode of major depression and anxiety.  It has been a rough school year for me with a lot of changes that brought me to the point of uncontrollable crying for two days in a row, migraines, muscle tension, and an inability to really get any work done with my students.  My principal suggested I take the day to go to the doctor, and now I'll be out for over two weeks attending group counselling sessions and starting antidepressants.

Everyone is telling me that I need to take care of myself now, but I can't help feeling guilty.  I feel I am letting everyone down and worry that I still won't be of any use when I return in a few weeks.  This is supposed to make me feel better, but all I can think about is how awkward it will be when I return.  What will my coworkers and students think?

Has anyone else on this subreddit been through a similar situation? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I grew up in Gardena and there are a lot of different micro-cultures within the city.  

One of my favorite facts about Gardena is that many Japanese immigrated to the city, so there are a lot of fantastic Japanese restaurants.  It's what I miss most about living there!  Definitely look up the Shinsengumi chain of restaurants.

I never came across any active gang members in my 10+ years living there, just some graffiti every once in awhile.  Then again, I lived in what some may call the nicer part of Gardena.  My elementary school (Chapman Elementary) received the California Distinguished school award and was ethnically diverse.  In fact, I've never found another city as ethnically diverse as Gardena.

My suggestion is to do some research.  There are websites that can help you determine things like crime rate in any city that can help you pinpoint where in Gardena you would like to live.  I would highly recommend moving there as long as you do your research. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Today was an awful day.  

It was supposed to be a great day because my kids put on a play showing off their awesome reading skills to their parents and other students at the school (my kids are in Kindergarten, for the record).  Then we received a memo that there would be assemblies and field trips during the day.  Also, my full time aide would be pulled out for pretty much all day.  He's been pulled from my room every day for the past week, so I shouldn't have been surprised.  

Why is this a big deal?  Well, because I have a class of 30 kids and he's in charge of our stage crew who are designing costumes, scenery, and props so everyone is involved in the play.  Since he keeps getting pulled out, we haven't gotten practice or to finish those things.  There was an aide who offered to help, but she didn't finish until 30 minutes after all of the parents and students had arrived to watch the performance.  I had to improve while waiting.  I ended up leading everyone in nursery rhymes and Simon Says.  Not to mention a student cut herself with fabric scissors she found laying around so deeply that she wouldn't stop bleeding for like 10 minutes.

I'm sure it wasn't as bad as I thought it was, but it's frustrating planning all of these fun things and then not being ready because admin decides to pull my aide and change the day.  I feel like a failure for not being able to figure it out and be ready for what was supposed to be a great day.  In the end, it was probably my stress that made the day not as great as it should have been for the kids.  I feel like I have failed my kids by not being prepared.  THAT is the worst feeling of all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tomorrow, I'm picking up my two bunnies from their bunnymoon with a professional rabbit matchmaker and bonder.  I want to make sure that everything is great for them when they come home and that I don't ruin the great bonding they have done over the past week.

One of the pair is a recent widower, so everything I have right now belonged to him his past love.  The big rabbit pen that they used as a litter box is one of those items.  It is made out of plastic, so my husband says that I should just wipe it down with vinegar and it will be fine, but what do you think?  Is a new bunny pair able to use an old litter box that has just been wiped down thoroughly?  Should I just buy a new one?  As for their cardboard bunny mansion, the bonder says to just reintroduce it after a couple of weeks - but I still wonder about that too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have lived here for a couple of years now, and have had the occasional teen trying to sell newspaper subscriptions at my door.  Didn't think much of it until today when a grown man tried to do the same thing.  After I told him I'd heard the pitch before about trying to fund raise for his school, he told me he just got out of juvie and his parole officer was making him do this so he could go to college.  Total bullshit.  When I told him that I wasn't interested and didn't have anything for him, he told me he wasn't begging because he wasn't a bum.  I said "Good Luck" and closed the door on him.  Anyway, it was very disconcerting - especially after reading about people doing this and then burglarizing houses.  I haven't experienced that yet, but it's still a scary thought.

Has anyone else experienced this?  Also, why does this happen here?  When I lived in L.A., I never got door-to-door scammers like this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I pretty much love all styles of pixie, but am torn between getting a pixie and a bob.  My biggest concern is that it won't look good on my face shape and with my glasses.  I've spent hours scouring Pinterest for different styles, and just couldn't settle on one.  My hair is wavy and will not stay straight if it is humid out, so I am hoping for something that looks good wavy and is possibly longer in the front.  I would prefer something low maintenance, but will spend extra time if necessary.  I am a Kindergarten teacher, so I am hoping for something that looks professional as well.

<TEXT> I have been stuck at the same charter school for 6 years now, and I would love to get a district job.  Everyone I know who has left my school has gone to another charter school, and every time I apply for a position at a public school I don't hear back - not even a call.

I have no idea why that is - are there no positions for newer teachers?  Am I somehow undesirable as someone who's worked at a charter school for so long?

<TEXT> I just finished it today and enjoyed it.  I was extremely intrigued by the world the series created and even more so when I found out that Chicago was an experiment.  To me, Tris offering to go in Kaleb's place was foreshadowed in her previous sacrifices, but a sign of maturity and her nature as Abnegation like her parents.  She would not be Tris if she had let her brother die.  To be honest, I was also curious about whether or not she would be able to fight off the death serum.  She was stubborn to the end.  If Kaleb had gone instead, he would have died via death serum before ever pushing the button, and the sacrifice of his life would be for naught.  After she died, the dual narration all made sense and everything clicked into place.  It was well-written, in my opinion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am a teacher going into my 6th year at a charter school in the Los Angeles area.  Pretty much every year I've been at the charter school, I've applied for jobs at public school districts and never received a reponse.  While I am excited for the work I am doing where I am, what I would like is to get a more secure job at a public district closer to where I live (Orange County).  This year a great district nearby put out an application for potentially 30 positions, and I never heard a word back from them.

I don't consider myself a new teacher, but I wonder what experiences others have had in this area as teachers who have been stuck in the charter system or perhaps even in other states.  Every teacher I've met can only find charter school jobs, one even moving as far as Northern California just to have one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You probably experienced a honeymoon period with him until recently.  Now he is more familiar with you and communicating his disapproval with you through nips.  Avoid physical contact unless he approaches you  and only give pets when his head is down for awhile.  To encourage him approaching you, lay still in a space near where he is.  It may take time, but be patient and don't get discouraged.  This is how you earn trust.  I took in a bunny off the street and the same thing happened with her.  

It is also natural for rabbits to chew on things as it helps them keep their teeth from overgrowing.  I recommend going to a pet shop and providing him with a few options to keep him from damaging furniture - my rabbits love the heavy hay tunnel because it doesn't move much when they chew on it, but every bunny is different.  If you have carpet, make sure all of the corners are inaccessible because he may pull it up.

Rescuing bunnies is one of the most rewarding experiences ever, so keep up the good work!  =) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yikes!  I have no idea what the protocol is because I've never tried to contact a therapist.  All of my medical is through Kaiser, and my general doctor likes to just prescribe me medicine instead of really trying to figure out what's going on - so I doubt she would refer me.  =/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> Happy Cake Day!

Thank you for the very specific feedback and strategies.  I will try my best to incorporate them into my life as well (rabbits may become my thing now).  I'm starting to think that I cry when I feel frustrated, especially when I'm trying to get a point across and I can't or I feel completely helpless in any given situation.  In terms of conversations, I have no way of knowing if people feel like I don't care when they tell me problems - because most of the time they talk to me once and that's it.  The only person in my life who is brutally honest about my social shortcomings is my husband - learning about them at 29 is a bit late in the game.

Thanks for helping me feel a little more hopeful about what a therapist could do for me, even one with very little ASD experience.  =) </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's awesome!  I'm thinking being diagnosed will be a relief too if I decide to see someone about it.

The exact same thing is happening in my life.  All I want is to help, and I'm slowly figuring out how to do that without sounding arrogant and like a know-it-all.  I'm not sure if I'd rather have influence over situations or people, because in my workplace the actions and decisions of the people highly inform the systems.  I guess the main thing I want to do is turn our campus into a well-oiled machine - I often feel like we waste time on unimportant busy work when we should be problem solving and moving forward.  Efficiency. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I will definitely do that. At first I was concerned that people would judge me for joining and not being diagnosed, but it feels like there are a lot of understanding people here who will help whether you're an Aspie or just wondering if you are one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> True. I'm not worried about labeling, in fact my fear is to go and not be labeled as ASD. I've spent all of my life feeling like an outcast who can't get it (social interaction) right no matter how hard I try. It would be nice to feel like I belong somewhere.

My concern in the workplace is better understanding my faults and how to improve myself so that I can make a difference and have a greater impact possibly in a leadership or support role.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> How can getting diagnosed and seeing a psychologist or therapist help a fairly high functioning adult with Asperger Syndrome? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-30 05:33:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First of all, I just have to say that "Aspergers" being squiggly red underlined is really killing me.  I even changed it to "Asperger Syndrome" but it was still squiggled.  UGH.  I think this is a group of like-minded souls, so hopefully some of you will understand and appreciate my sentiment.

As a 29 year old female who always just considered myself socially awkward, I have begun to realize that I may have Aspergers due to other personality traits of mine. As a teacher, I try to be the most positive and professional version of myself at all times (while at work), yet I am always unintentionally angering students, parents, and coworkers or am under the impression that they just don't like me .  The only grade level I feel comfortable working with is Kindergarten - I get them and they get me (it's very difficult to offend a Kindergartner because they just say what they mean just like me)!  I have a real passion for education reform and have great ideas for improving our school and creating a more effective and efficient workplace - which I try to share with everyone a lot more than I probably should.

However, sharing the first thing that pops into my mind and accidentally offending people is not the best way to effect change or become a leader.  I have learned how to control my verbal outbursts in most social settings, but it is damn near impossible when I am so passionate about the subject!  

TL;DR: I am considering getting an official diagnosis and doing therapy in order to improve my professionalism in the workplace, but is it worth it?  Have any of you been through therapy as an adult diagnosed with Aspergers and had it improve your social standing? </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Fit Check] First bras that (kinda) fit! What do you think of the fit...? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-26 19:28:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I used to wear a 34B, but my husband convinced me to come here and determine my true bra size. He helped me record measurements and everything, so I've measured myself to a 30F/FF by U.K. sizes. I live in the U.S. so there weren't really any places to shop nearby and I had to purchase online. To make matters worse, I also realize that I measured myself in the middle of my cycle which is supposed to be when breasts swell up.

Some of you lovely ladies recommended bra styles for narrow, even, and projected breasts.  After trying these on, I'm not sure if I'm as even as I thought I was (or maybe the size is just too large).

These are pictures of me in the Panache Jasmine:
[30FF Front](http://i.imgur.com/AdOkyOx)
and [30FF Side](http://i.imgur.com/cBPdqod)

and the Cleo Lily, which fits better but still seems a little loose at the top even after the scoop and swoop. The underwire is also somewhat digging into my sternum, leaving marks:
[30F Front](http://i.imgur.com/Rw0NJH6)
and [30F Side](http://i.imgur.com/vJkp5LX)

So what are my next steps?  Are there any other sizes/brands/styles you would recommend? </TEXT>

<TEXT> As others said, having a routine and sticking to it faithfully is crucial. Your first few weeks should be focused on getting those routines and procedures in order with fewer academics. Also, get to know your kids and let them get to know you. You should also provide time for "brain breaks," which are short spurts of time the kids can just relax so they can focus better on learning throughout the day. Check GoNoodle.com for some cool ones you can do with the kids. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Panache Jasmine came in, and

1) I'm not even as I thought, I'm not very full on top, and

2) I made the mistake of doing this in the middle of my period - never realized that my breasts swell up during that time

Wearing a 30 felt wonderful, even though the straps were kind of uncomfortable.  I'm not sure why that was, although they seemed to hit wider than I'm used to (closer to the shoulder than evenly between my neck and shoulder).  I'm hoping the 30F fits better than the 30FF.  If not, do you know which styles are better for full on the bottom and not-so-much on top?

Edit: Just looked up the scoop and swoop - now only a little big at the top!  This will do nicely as a period bra. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My bunnies hate being put on their backs, so I found a way to minimize the time I put them in the bunny burrito (covering their eyes and petting their heads for a bit while they are in burrito does seem to calm them down a bit though).  My shower has a little seat on it that's the perfect size for a bunny to lay on, so I put them up there to clip their front paws.  I let them get comfortable and then clip their front nails one at a time, turning them to the side for better access.  They were squirmy at first, but they got the hang of it after awhile.  The back nails still need to be trimmed in a burrito, though.  Sometimes I hold them under an arm, but other times I hold them between my thighs so I have the usage of both hands. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Measurement Checks] From 34B to 30F/FF... really?! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-19 04:48:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I did the measurements, but am still in disbelief about the results.  I actually had measurements done at Victoria's Secret years ago and she told me I was 36A.  I always wore 34B, but most of the bras I used at that size didn't fit properly.  Anytime I wore a bra that was less than full coverage, I would be spilling out.  

I used the 5 measurement numbers and the site provided which say that the 30F/FF in UK terms actually translates to 30G in the US - where I am from.  Here are the numbers I came up with for measurements (in inches):

1. 29.5
2. 27.25
3. 35.5
4. 38
5. 36

Also just found out that my breasts are projected, narrow, and even using the other measurement charts here.
