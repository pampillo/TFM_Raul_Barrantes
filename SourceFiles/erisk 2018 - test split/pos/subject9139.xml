I feel like I can't bear living any longer, it is too painful. And I also have many other symptoms of depression, so I'm not sure if your comment really applies. But thanks anyway! </TEXT>

I find the spiritual part of Buddhism quite offputting, since I am a convinced atheist and skeptic. Other than that I think it teaches a wonderful way of living. I have never studied any eastern philosophies in depth, but I know that some of the things I do to keep my depression at bay are quite in line with their precepts, I have just arrived there by other means.

<TEXT> Thank you for your advice and your words of support.

My family knows that I am depressed, I just don't share with them the specific details about how this affects my life. Whenever I have done that, I have regreted it afterwards because it only makes them feel sad and powerless. There truly is nothing they can do apart from being there for me if I ever need anything, which they already are. I agree that family can be the most reliable and genuine support, but none of them have any close experience with depression and they simply don't understand what I'm going through. </TEXT>

Regarding your first question, I think I already explained in my answer to your other comment.

The problem about vacations is they need organizing, and this is pretty hard to do when the most proactive thing you have done in weeks is writing an AMA in reddit. Plus even if I could find the energy to go somewhere else, I would probably only see the inside of my hotel room. Bit of a waste, isn't it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for your kind words. Many people don't understand that this is in fact an illness, it has taken myself some time to fully accept it.

I will get a second opinion even if I have to ask my husband to physically drag me to the doctor because I don't have the energy to do it myself. Switching meds could make me feel better and anything with that effect would be very welcome, but still this is not a permanent solution. I wouldn't like to be tied to medication forever. Suppose I get new meds and my life goes back to normal and I feel well again, then what? I would most likely want to have a baby, and I can't get pregnant while on the meds! </TEXT>

I am now at a point where I have lost hope and I don't really trust doctors any more. I know I should look for a new doctor and start again, but this requires a lot of energy that I simply don't have at the moment. The medication did work well at the beginning, but I think that was a combination of Placebo effect and the fact that I was so far down that anything was an improvement. In the beginning the pills gave me hope, and I think that was more important than the chemicals. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have indeed thought about it. I live in Dublin, Ireland and I am conscious that the bad weather and lack of sunlight may be affecting my mood. My husband and I are currently looking for options in sunnier pastures. Having said that, I am not from Ireland originally and I moved here because I quite like it. Plus I really love my job, although I am at a risk of losing it because I can't get out of bed most days.

About my family, yes, they are far away and I quite like it that way. They would do anything for me and they make me feel very loved, but there are a lot of things I'd rather not share with them. It would only make them unhappy, and there isn't anything they can do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He proposed right after I was diagnosed with clinical depression, so he knew what he was getting into. He knows that I think about it a lot, but I think he's still in denial about how often and how strongly I feel this. He's always there to hug me when I've had a "bad day" and doesn't ask many questions because he knows it's better to let me talk when I'm ready. I don't hide anything from him but I do try to cushion him somehow because it makes him so unhappy...

It has indeed taken a huge toll on him. I can see how powerless he feels every day, how he tries to help in every possible way he can and he fails time after time. I sometimes wonder if he may not be getting depressed himself as a consequence of living with me. </TEXT>

Yes, I have been on antidepressants for two years now. I have worked with several therapists and I saw a psychiatrist regularly for about a year. I strongly wanted the therapy to work, I gave it my best and it just wasn't enough. The medication (Prozac) did help a lot in the beginning, but when I started feeling worse again and I went to the doctor, he simply doubled my dose. This didn't work at all and I went through hell trying to go back to the original dose, 20 mgs, which is what I am taking now. </TEXT>
