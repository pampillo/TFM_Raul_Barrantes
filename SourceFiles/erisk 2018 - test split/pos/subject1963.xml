<TEXT> Diamonds and gems - even non-engagement gifts - are a big deal. I think it's just the DIAMOND thing. It's a very romantic gift. My fianc did something similar. We had only been together like two months when my birthday came around, getting serious pretty fast. But we had talked about all kinds of weird stuff and I had mentioned once that I'd wanted a ring in my birthstone. I don't even remember how or why it would have come up. 

In comes my 21st birthday. I wasn't working at the time, staying at his place. He was only 24 but had a very respectable job, his own place, great finances, the whole deal. He's a lot like your boyfriend actually, frugal mostly but knows when to invest. He came home from work, reached into a the pocket of a coat that was hanging on the door, and literally tossed a ring box at me. 

That was it. Just "Hey, sorry I'm home a little late, Happy Birthday!" And a tossed ring box. Understandably, I had a panic face on, but he just turned bright red which didn't help my nerves. As I started opening it he explained that he remembered me saying it a while ago and thought this was a good opportunity. 

So here's this ring, white gold and an oval amethyst and a couple of tiny diamonds on the side. He kept stammering on about how the diamonds were really really tiny and were barely diamonds anyway, but that he thought I might like it. I still don't know how much it cost, at least a few hundred dollars, and only two months in?! I was basically super embarrassed but very grateful. My family didn't have money growing up, nicer things were hard to come by, I'd never been given jewelry like this ever. 

Think of it like this: he invests in tech. He wants a quality item that serves a function or makes him happy. He is frugal at times so that he can splurge other times, where he feels it is deserved. He has decided to invest in a gift for you. He found something that would bring you joy, he wanted to do that for you. It is flattering and it also FEELS like a lot of pressure. But he clearly trusts and loves you enough to want to do this for you. 

I lose my shit all the time. I am the worst. But now I have an engagement ring worth ~$7k that I haven't lost ever. My amethyst ring sits in a dish by my bed right next to my engagement ring. I once misplaced my engagement ring for like four minutes and freaked. But I know what it's worth and I know the sentimental value so I check for it on my hand. It's beautiful and I cherish it. 

It sounds like you guys are on roughly the same page about your relationship. An age difference can be a BIG factor - our difference was even smaller but I felt like the ring carried SO much meaning because it came from someone who was very well established in his life. 

Do you love the ring? Do you WANT to wear it? Sounds like it. Wear it. Love it. Don't think of the number. Think of it like you did before - it cost some amount of money, it's beautiful, you appreciate it. That's my only advice. The discomfort you're feeling is very normal. It can take some getting used to. For a few months after we got engaged I couldn't stop thinking "I'm carrying seven grand on my hand!" And I still get nervous about losing it or anything happening to it. It's natural to feel jittery about an expensive gift. 

Practically speaking, too, you don't even have to worry about putting it on your parents insurance. There are insurance companies that are specifically for jewelry. In fact, most jewelers work in-house with a third party insurer. That's how mine is insured. They just ask for an appraisal and stuff and it's a really small payment.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is so me. I've always been heavier, I was 206/Size 14 at my heaviest, with some MAJOR body dysmorphia that pretty much had me convinced that I looked like I was 500 pounds. When I got engaged in 2015 with a wedding planned for 2017 I was like "oh well, I'll just have more time to find a dress that doesn't make me look fat". My mother and sister dearest (bitches!) made "funny" comments about fitting my butt into dresses, finding something that fit right, trying on 200 dresses, etc. I know they love me but they can be a little shitty sometimes. It hurts. I felt like they were justifying the picture I had of myself. And they made it sound like I could never change, I'd just slowly get bigger or stay where I was, and that was that. Not like they have room to talk. My mom is pretty heavy and my sister has put on like 20 pounds in the last year. But they do like I did, swear up and down that a change will be made, weight will be lost. Never happened for any of us. 

Shortly after I started treatment for depression. And I began getting more and more upset at the comments. So I started eating super healthy, vegan at home, put more effort into my appearance and into my health.  Stopped making excuses. Knew I didn't want to feel awful at my wedding. 

I'm down to 180ish. Not a huge loss but... something. And I got to order my dress in an 8! I am on track to lose maybe 34 more, landing me at around 145-150, a weight I haven't been since I was 16. I will probably have to alter my dress down to a 6.  I'm okay with this. 

Your progress is freaking amazing. You're going to slay at this wedding!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Family is being dumb 
2. Family is being EXTRA dumb
3. We're over budget 
4. I am getting lazy 
5. There are only four months left 
6. I still have to arrange everyone's accommodations

Coping? Mostly naps. And sushi. Also, I bought cute roller skates. They're fun and it's a great workout but I still have problems skating... in general. So it's funny. FH used to skate like crazy when he was younger so he had zero problems getting used to it again, literally skating in circles around me. I fell twice. Still fun. 

But I really am looking forward to the wedding weekend, even if half of everything goes wrong, it will be great. And besides, we have an awesome two week honeymoon that we leave for the same day we leave our venue (day after the wedding). So, even if it's stressful and I am ready to GO, there's plenty to look forward to.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been with my guy for six years now and I initially felt exactly like you do. Actually, sometimes I still feel that way, but I've learned a few ways to make myself less of a jerk. 

My family situation was a little fucked up. My parents screamed at each other, sometimes at my sister, mostly at me. We also didn't have much money but we apparently had enough that my parents could buy themselves nice things... then complain about how we were short on grocery money. I spent as much of my life out of the house as I could, starting in middle school. They had a nasty divorce when my sister and I were 17 and 20, they're still jerks, whatever. 

My fiances parents divorced when he was really young but they're all still very friendly. They both remarried and both sides of the family are very close and very normal. It's so weird seeing a family interact and thinking "is this what families are supposed to do???" 

I was almost resentful and to be honest, spending time with some of them was really annoying for a while. But I got over it. I was very honest with my FH from the beginning about why I was weird around his family - he'd seen some of my family's dysfunctional dynamics firsthand, so he knew, but it still took him a long time to really understand how hard it was for me - just like I didn't know what a "good" family was like, he didn't know what a "bad" one was like. 

Talk to your girlfriend. Let her know it's nothing personal, that you just never had that normalcy, and that you're used to having a guard up around family and it's a difficult thing to unlearn. And until it gets easier, find something to help you get through visits. 

For me, it went like this: I know every person has their problems. Some of FH's family isn't my favorite. But whether or not I liked them didn't matter. I picked one or two things to be my "focus" with each person. Asked them about X thing they liked to do, or Y thing they had mentioned doing last time I saw them. They were happy to see me taking an interest, I got more comfortable, and slowly it became easier to spend time around them. 

But your biggest helper here has to be your girl - she may not understand completely, but if she knows a little about your family, she will get it if you sit down with her and say "this is not something I'm used to, can you help me out until I get more comfortable?"  </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be honest, I'M impressed, which is funny. I keep thinking about it and it's mostly dread and stress but every once in a while I'm like "oh shit, this is kinda strong too, check me out". 

Super not weird to say you're proud of me. Thank you!! You're my new mom now though, is that cool? I'll be there in two weeks! Yay! 

A zoo wedding sounds so cool! We knew we wanted a "unique" venue and we definitely ended up with one. A zoo sounds like so much fun though omg I would be too busy running around to have a wedding.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It WOULD be a shame. For him. For me... this is my olive branch. If he wants to set it on fire, that's on him. He's a grown up. He'll just prove exactly how much he cares about his family, and I'll be fine either way. 

And thank you for saying that. I do try, I've had a really hard last few years with untreated depression and the last few months of treatment have been incredibly hard, but my confidence to confront my dad only happened because I'm working on getting better. I should have done this a long time ago, I've always been the no-nonsense sort of "keep your drama approximately ninety billion miles away from me thank you" kind of person, so I feel like I don't do enough. It feels really good to hear someone say that, so thanks.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Basically, my sister got pregnant at 18. She was nowhere near ready to have a baby. She was on birth control but it obviously failed. Long story short, she found a wonderful family to adopt the baby, open adoption, and they have been a major part of our family since then. Literally a week after he was born, she brought their family on our family vacation. She sees us for birthdays and holidays and we plan stuff together. I get to see my nephews (he's got an older brother, also adopted) all the time and it makes me really happy. 

My dad is a fucking child. That's putting it nicely. He has always been immature, angry, overly sensitive, and a raging asshole. He is still my dad, but after my parents split in 2010, I have seen him less and less every year. Last year I saw him twice. I haven't spoken to him since Christmas Eve. I would still like he and my stepfamily to be able to be at the wedding. So they are invited, as guests. We're skipping the traditional toasts and dances and stuff because that's not us, so I get to tell him that too. But. 

My dad has never met his grandson. Not once. The mother of my nephew, K, is super nice but she is fierce as hell, too. There were rules to introducing new family to the baby. Since my dad and sister were on the outs when the baby was born, he wasn't there for the birth like my mom's family was. (It's worth noting that my sister and dad/stepfamily were on the outs because, when they found out sister was pregnant, they sobbed and told her she was making a mistake and told her she couldn't just give her baby away, that if she didn't want it they would raise it, blah blah. They never at once respected her decision. I shut that shit down really fast by becoming the middle man between them and my sister. But it was a HUGE blow to my sister, who was already going through an incredibly tough time.) 

K had never met my dad's family.  She did know what they'd said to my sister, so she knew they were being totally rude about the whole thing. So the rule was, when he came to meet the baby for the first time, it would be at K's house. And it would have to just be my dad at first. She didn't want a whole group of people she didn't know coming into her home with a lot of really tense emotion. Totally reasonable. 

Except to my dad and stepmom, it wasn't. They INSISTED that their family be able to see him, all of them, on THEIR schedule. Uh. No. Shot down. So instead of then following the rules, Dad tried AGAIN with "oh, just me and stepmom then". No. Just you. One at a time. That's the rule. K was super flexible with her schedule, she and my sister tried countless times to get my dad to meet with them. He would meet with my sister for breakfast, swear it was just going to be him, and surprise! Stepmom is in the car too. She never apologized for how she acted towards my sister. I don't blame her for her feelings, I understand that a LITTLE BIT because of her family background - religious, very close. But it doesn't excuse her reaction. 

So, it's been FOUR YEARS since then. My nephew is going to turn 5 before this wedding. None of my dad's family has met them. 

So here's where I have to wedge myself in - I am having a wedding. We have the venue for the weekend, which is important, but even if we didn't, this means that both sets of people will be in the same place. I do not want this first meeting to happen at my wedding. I don't want to know what will happen. I am not risking it. So I thought about it, and I told my sister and mom and my fiance. I am going to contact K. I am going to ask her if she's willing to meet with my dad, and maybe later my stepmom, before the wedding. If she is, I'm going by HER schedule. She'll make time, I know she will. 

Then I'm going to go to my dad and tell him this: "I am not going to have this first meeting be at my wedding. It's time for you guys to meet, and then in September we can all have a nice time together with no tension. Here is how it will go: you will drive to my house. If you are alone, I will drive you in my car to K's house. You will meet. If it goes well, we can introduce stepmom, then stepsisters and etc at a later date. We might even be able to go straight from just you that day to the four of you a week later if things go really well. This will happen before my wedding because it is waaayyy too high stress to add to an already stressful time. If you can follow this one rule, great! Everyone will get to know each other and we can do things together more often. I would love that. But if you can't follow that rule, you will not be coming to my wedding. End of story." 

I used to be a bit timid about stressful things because I had a weird childhood and I am also just a ball of nerves at the best of times. Some time in the last few years I grew a shiny steel spine and I do enjoy wielding it from time to time. But man, does this one hurt. I can't believe it has taken this long. I can't believe his ego has been soooo important for almost FIVE YEARS... to the degree that he's never met his first grand kid. 

Sorry for the rant, I just figure there will be other wedditors out there with dumb family things going on, and while I frequent justnofamily and stuff like that, I needed perspective from other people getting married or who have gotten married with crappy family stuff going on. Done.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, "taking a deep breath" is for squares. I prefer gin. I told my mother this the other day when she was half-assed listening to my rant about organizing accommodations (because it somehow became my responsibility to make sure everyone rents the right places, even though I provided TONS of information on four different options) and how I just want to make people comfortable, because we're going to be there all weekend, and... I just got up in the middle of the conversation, got some gin, sat back down. Mom was like "where did you go?" And I said "gin." And she said "oh. Do you want me to help with organizing things?" Uh, duh. Needed that a while ago, last time I asked. Maybe before I turn to the devil's drink to get me through the day. 

I would suggest talking to Grandma yourself and seeing what she wants to do. Mom is, of course, going to just try and push through. This is not quite what you wanted anyway, so talk to Grandma and see what she wants to do. I don't know your Grandma, but most Grandmas I know would be cool with whatever would make everyone else feel comfortable. Let her Skype in for as much as she wants. Have your mom make sure that the guests know ahead of time what happened and why Grandma isn't there. If there are any specific "birthday" things that would be out, it's up to you whether or not to remove those things. Anything with vendors? That too. Let them know if it's relevant to what they're doing. It's going to be a bummer but it's going to happen, and at the end of the day, I'm gonna throw the line at you, it will really be worth it. You'll be married, the whole ordeal will be over and THEN you can relax. Maybe with liquor. I don't know you, I don't know what you drink, but you've earned a few.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's like you're me, but me from a year ago. FH and I got engaged 12-19-15. We're getting married in September, so not completely two years but it has certainly felt like it. A long engagement has its pros and cons - the positives being more time to plan, more availability with venues, more time to save money, and more time to really fine tune what you want. I was very cool and blas about the whole thing at first. I kind of wanted a longer engagement anyway. But I got overconfident and thought "I'll have plenty of time!" and now I'm planning a majority of my wedding with four months to go. So, YMMV. 

The extra time can absolutely feel like ages. Mentally, it seems totally reasonable to wait another few months, what's another few months in the long run, blah blah. But oh man can it get on your nerves. I wanted to be married by this last winter. We picked through venues (we live in LA but wanted a very outdoorsy wedding up a mountain and wanted somewhere that we could have the venue for the whole weekend instead of just a single day) and I basically gave up for a while. I was convinced we were never going to get married. 

BUT! After many, uh, unique (insane) google search terms, I stumbled upon our venue. It's everything I wanted and it's so pretty and charming it makes me want to puke. The people who own it are literally the nicest people I've ever met. I didn't find them on wedding wire or the knot or any of the specialty sites. I just started changing up my search terms, I think I found these guys through some kind of combo of "wedding photography blog southern california mountain weekend trees". No lie. Went through the image searches. A photographer's blog about a pretty wedding they shot is what lead me to the venue. A beautiful photo of a field near the ceremony spot. I felt like crying. I had been engaged eight months at that point and was so disheartened. I was set on this place without even seeing it in person. Once I'd found the name, I went ham on searching for more wedding blogs with pictures. So. Pretty. It is three hours from home - not quite 3,000 miles, but still requires a hefty drive for most things - and it's not at all in the area I thought I would find something. But it is perfect. 

Point being, it WILL happen. I pinky promise. And it will be super annoying to feel like you're waiting forever sometimes, but you'll be grateful for the extra time, too. Enjoy being engaged. Get creative with your search. Think about how feasible it would be for you to organize vendor meetings - might require a trip for tastings but most information is easily passed on through email or skype. Think about doing an all-inclusive venue if there are any in the area - then you can see if you can do a single visit, if you love it, one more visit might do it. I'm guessing you'd be planning farther away because that's where family is - do you have any family there that could run errands for you? Trust someone's opinion on cake? That's another option. 

Sorry this turned into an essay. I had coffee for the first time in two months, lol, but also I just have Feelings about long engagements and finding the right place.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Plenty of people have covered how shitty the situation is and how unreasonable your parents are going, so as a person currently in the middle of planning a wedding with my psycho family, I'll help with logistics. Where is your wedding? Anywhere private? If it's a backyard wedding it's different, but I'm going to go with the idea that you're having a traditional sort of wedding/venue. Most of them have some sort of entrance. This will be important later. 

You sit down with your parents and your sister together. You tell them that her behavior is what's causing this - you shouldn't have to worry about your adult sister's tantrums, especially on your wedding day. You understand she went through something awful, and she is your sister, but her behavior is not okay. There will be a dress code. It will be enforced. There will be a standard of behavior that will be enforced. 

And you hire security. Doesn't need to be anything fancy, might cost a couple hundred bucks, but if you really want your family there and they insist she comes, you can have someone on hand to remove her if she does something ridiculous. Or just not let her in if she looks like a slob. They stand at the entrance or near a central point when people arrive. You can let them know specifically who it is you're worried about, that she's only there because your family refused to come without her. You get your family there, you get peace of mind. But you have to be very clear with them that this is only because you really want your parents and grandparents there. You're not condoning her behavior. But if it takes that to get them to go, and hiring security, it might be worth it. 

I've been seriously considering one for my wedding because both of my sets of parents are dramatic assholes who never grew up. It's a big chunk of change in an already tight budget, but if I don't have to worry, it's worth it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My 10M has done this since I started with them two years ago. It's a pain in the brain but just remember, they're just kids with dumb kid brains. I am not gonna lie and say I'm not still offended sometimes, but then I remember I can either A: ice him out and ignore him and his comments until he gets bored, or B: take away his screen time, which makes him more mad so he throws a tantrum, but it gets him out of my face for a while. 

Only in the last few months have I gotten a really good grasp on how to handle him. His parents work a lot but they're well aware of what he's like, he's been going to a behavioral therapist and has gotten a little better. Still has fits and screams about everyone ruining his life. Now I just ignore it, or if he tries to bug me to get something I just raise my eyebrows and look at him until he walks away. Calm. Cool. Collected. I'm not any of those things but I am damn good at pretending, lol. 

I play both good cop and bad cop. If you play fair and follow the rules and want to hang out and have fun, great! Go grab a little piece of homework after two healthy snacks. Want to have a dance party? I'll DJ! Want to kick and scream on the floor because I won't let you have screen time even though you were right there when your mom told me you couldn't have any today? You can go sit your butt at the far side of the dining room table, where I can see you from the couch, and you can read a book or draw. My kiddos know that if they can't follow directions, I am a no-nonsense kinda nanny. But that if they're respectful, rewards come. 

But again, it's been two years for me. And sometimes I feel like some of the things I say or do are a little petty. But the big booster for my respect also came from the parents - reports on continued bad behavior, requesting to sit down with the kid and remind the kid that I am totally in charge while they're away. Setting very firm rules helped a lot. that thing about the healthy snacks? They have to have two full healthy, like, fruit or veg, maybe cheese, snacks before they can ask for candy. Their treat is usually something small - two starburst, a mini chocolate. Whatever's in the cabinet. But if behavior is bad, no amount of healthy snacks is going to earn that reward back when it's taken away. And if they cry, if they try to be a jerk when you have to say No to something - not your fault. They know exactly what they're doing, and it's crappy but that's a prime age for kids learning to push boundaries with authority. Don't let the waterworks pressure you into it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Carnival Sensation out of Miami, September 11th. Ocho Rios and Grand Cayman. Aft extended balcony - haven't had a balcony since I was a kid with my family. Never been on an East Coast cruise at all before, so we're excited even if it wasn't the ideal itinerary. We typically sail out of LA on the same class ship with Carnival (we live 15 minutes from port!) so this will be a nice change without being too jarring. We'll already know our way around! We just got confirmation we'll be doing the Chef's Table dinner too, a first for us. 

Getting married Saturday the 9th, breakfast with family on the 10th then getting on a plane, boarding on Monday, debarking Saturday. Then renting a nice convertible in Miami, having a nice lunch, and driving up to Orlando for 8 days at Disney World. Total of 2 weeks! I may be just as excited for my honeymoon as I am for my wedding weekend!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wanted to do that one! We're leaving the day after doing Ocho Rios and Grand Cayman - not my ideal ports but we'll find stuff to do. We're getting married on the 9th up a mountain in Southern California though, and not leaving until the morning of the 10th. Might be difficult to get to the port in time, so we picked the one leaving on the 11th.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is basically what happened with my SO. I thought he was cute, asked one of his friends about him. They said "he doesn't talk to girls" and I pretty much said "hold my beer!" except it was liquor. Sat down next to him, asked him a dumb question about the poker game he was playing, apparently had my hand on his knee for half the night (I do not remember this part because I was high on extrovert adrenaline) and we ended up spending the whole night talking. Went on our first date the next night. 

We're getting married in September. Woo!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sounds like my MIL. She likes to insinuate that I am some kind of two dimensional alcoholic. She forgets my birthday every year (going on six years in a row!) but the "gift" she throws together at the last minute (literally right after FH mentions it) always has something to do with wine - a wine journal (?), a wine glass, etc. She makes little digs all the time that, even if you hear the words, don't always make sense to other people. But basically more of the same - shrouded insults. 

On a camping trip last summer, I felt awful and sick and wasn't sleeping well. Unusual for me. I had been drinking whatever I normally drink on a camping trip, not excessively, and half of the rest of the family also had several beers and wine with dinner. I woke up one morning after breakfast and she laid into me with some kind of fucking inquisition trying to figure out what I was doing "wrong" - first she suggested I wasn't drinking enough water. I have been backpacking for 14 years and survival camping 15. I have been camping since I was an infant. I know how elevation works. She then was like "well it's probably because of how much you've been drinking!" 

FH didn't see the problem at the time. He has since learned. We started wedding planning a little over a year ago and she went full throttle. He was all "she can't be that bad, that's not like her" and I was like "she literally scolded me for wearing comfortable shoes to our forest wedding, made only negative comments when I tried on dresses, and gives me this condescending tone and smile CONSTANTLY" and then he started to see it. And he started to remember other shit she'd said that had made me uncomfortable through the years. Hah. Took him long enough.  </TEXT>

I have a bunch of spinal problems and 19 times out of 20, everyone behaves and doesn't bump. That one time though, some idiot rams into the back of my car and it puts me in a lot of pain for a few hours. I'm not going to stop riding it because normally people aren't jerks... but seriously. 

Even though it's at a lower speed, the cars are less stable. The effect is like genuinely getting rear-ended by someone. It's not cool.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think we have basically the same skin. I'm slightly more fair at MAC 15-20, skin LOOKS yellow but is actually olive, after much experimentation. I had issues finding a perfect color for so long because, like you said, cool stuff pulls grey and basically everything else pulls brown. I basically had to start following the rule that, whatever color I saw in the tube or on the applicator, it would show up two shades darker and one step more muted on my lips. I don't have this problem nearly as much with tube lipsticks, but liquids are basically built on hope, for me. 

I know lots of people hate on Lime Crime but the ONLY color I've ever had that works as a true pinky nude on me, doesn't look too dark or muted, is Marshmallow. Putting that stuff on my lips the first time was a celebration. It comes out of the tube looking VERY pale but once it dries down and sets over the course of 20 minutes or so, it looks quite a bit rosier. I have darker natural lips and it covers completely in one thin coat and isn't as drying as many other liquid lipsticks I have owned. 

If you're concerned about information/security leaks because of their website, fret not - Amazon has almost every shade of their liquid lips for $20 with free prime shipping. That's where I get all of mine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A close friend of mine got pregnant at 19, before the whole insurance requirement was a thing. She worked part time but lived with her retired grandmother. She was otherwise perfectly healthy so they skipped insurance and paid out of pocket on the occasion she got sick or hurt, but once she found out she was pregnant, they tried to get her insurance and she was turned down because she was very petite and pregnant. Pre-existing condition and somewhat high risk because of her size. They applied for some financial help and got a little, but she had to pay something like $28k when all was said and done. 

Another friend had "good" insurance but still had to meet a deductible that was something like $6k remaining. And then still had to pay co-pays (and later, specialist copays, which were $80) towards the end of her pregnancy. 

And yes, in some cases with great insurance that you've had for a while, it can cost virtually zero out of pocket. But those are the plans that are not only very expensive but not offered by a majority of employers. When it comes to prenatal visits on insurance, it is sometimes less than a regular doctor visit. But you need far more prenatal visits over the course of nine months than a not pregnant person would need over an entire year, so it's kind of a moot point.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is honest, and I like it. I do feel like I give Dan a few too many excuses for weird behaviors because I know them to be normal for him. Doesn't mean they're good behaviors or that I should give him a pass for being a jerk about this. His ex-girlfriend was straight up crazy pants and I knew it but I got along with her when she was around because I know he loved her. The fact that I'm now realizing he hasn't done the same for me is... troubling. 

I have a feeling being more honest with Dan is going to go one of two ways - he'll feel bad and he'll really try to give this another chance, or he'll just continue to make excuses for his shunning Sam. That's on him though. 

Going by myself is not really an option. The rest of the group is all couples, I am not the kind of person to exclude my partner just because one or two people have crappy attitudes sometimes. He doesn't have a lot of friends either, we're not hyper social people to begin with, but I have kept these friends close because they feel like good friends most of the time. I'll have to "test" that a little and see if they're willing to try again. 

And I know the whole thing about getting married and having kids. I am actually kind of excited for that. Both Sam and myself work jobs where meeting friends isn't really possible (I'm a nanny, so the only people I see often are the kids and their parents, and he's the lone member of a specialized software team in a small-ish company dominated by people thirty years older than him. Once we pop out a kid or two, there will be opportunities to meet new people. We've thought about meetup groups or something like that beforehand but I don't think I ever felt it necessary until this point. But yeah, having kids and all that is going to be better for us emotionally than this point in our lives. We know it. Still trying to at least maintain some semblance of a social life while we're child free though. We'll see.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seconding the pole with a hook idea - kind of like the hooks in clothes shops for getting down unreachable hangers. I would suggest fishing line or some kind of decorative line (twine, ribbon) tied to each of the items you want to put up in a line, in whatever distance you like relative to the rafter spacing. You want a small weight to make sure the lanterns don't just pull the line off on the ends. You can even put a lantern or whatever on the end with something concealed/taped to the inside somehow, maybe a small wooden block from a craft store. With everything tied to stay in place and a weight at the end, start in the middle and work your way out on each side. You'll have to lift multiple lanterns over each rafter, but starting from the middle would mean less lanterns to lift on each side, and with a big enough hook you can probably lift a few lanterns at a time. Takedown would just be this in reverse. Might take a few minutes per line, but depending on your spacing and how many lines you choose to do, it could go pretty quickly. 

This is a modified version of how we hung stuff from rafters at an event my mom threw a while back. We had little hanging decoration things, lifted them from the middle and spaced them so that there were two or three between each rafter. Takedown was pretty quick and easy since the same person (me) put them up and took them down.  </TEXT>

I basically have gotten to the point where I'm going to have to just keep inviting people and seeing people until they get to know him better. Half of these people I haven't really been friends with for more than a year, and during that year Dan's been weird, so most people haven't gotten a real chance.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm gonna skip over the fairly rude tone of this and get to the points - no, Dan is not in love with me. Never has been. Neither of us is anywhere near each other's type, and I've been his wingman on several occasions. 

Dan can have a tendency to come across as shy, but I don't think dull is the right word. He's a workaholic and his work is very technical, so it's not like he has a bunch of funny office stories or weird things that happen with customers because that's not what he does. He watches the same shows as all of these people, has similar interests (perhaps even more that I have with them) the whole bit. They're just fast talkers. 

And again, I doubt it's me because we all talk online fairly often. We were invited to their wedding over dozens of other people, Dan is going to be in my wedding, we all saw a show together a little while ago, went to dinner another time, things I didn't set up but we were invited to. If they didn't want to be my friend, they wouldn't. But they do, they've shown that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah Dan is sort of the common denominator for most of the group. I do wonder if it's just the case of him leaving Sam out. But this behavior is really DRASTICALLY unlike Dan. Dan and I have known each other since we were five years old, we both have depression that we're working on and we're very close. Part of Dan's issue with Sam is that Dan is very likeable and has a ton of friends, and I think he was expecting Sam to be the same way because I'm with him and I'm that way, but Sam isn't that at all. Maybe it's disappointment with feeling like Sam doesn't want to be friends, but I have told Dan twice now that it isn't the case and that he just needs time. We just never get the chance. But Dan is a very nice person 99% of the time so I'm a little perplexed as to the reason why he's so strongly resisting talking to Sam. 

Sam is definitely not the resting bitch face type. He smiles a ton and laughs along, he is right there and paying attention to the conversation, it's just that he doesn't contribute as much because he doesn't want to intrude. 

Both Sam and Dan seem to be stuck in this "this is just how it is" mindset and it's so weird to me because neither of them are normally like that.  </TEXT>

My last one, I told her about a problem I was having with my mom, who is a real piece of work. I told her that I was occasionally taking communication breaks from my mom, a few days at a time where I just didnt open her texts or talk to her or get suckered into doing some ridiculous thing or hearing her yell for an hour. I expressed that it was helping a little, but that l needed to find a better long term solution because I can't just ignore my mom forever.

<TEXT> Thanks for the well thought out response! I appreciate it and it gave me a few new thoughts. 

Sam used to hang out with a pretty close knit group of people he has known since high school, but that group had a major social fallout/divide right around the time he and I got together, and they sort of split into two groups, each emphasizing a super annoying trait in the whole group - one group couldn't grow up and were slackers and couldn't take anything seriously, and the other group were gossipy and kind of jerks. We have pretty much stopped hanging out with all of them but one because we didn't want that kind of energy. It was good for us, and I thought this group of mine was different. They are! Sam and myself and the group all have very similar interests, and Sam does occasionally pipe in, so I'm kind of confused. 

I do agree that part of it is our fault though. I did ask Sam once in the beginning to try to be a little more social, but it is hard for him. But it's not like he's standoffish at all or that he actually comes off as rude - my family is loud and boisterous and social and they all LOVE Sam, because they know he's quiet and he saves his words for when he wants to actually make points or say something funny. They include him in conversation, ask him how he's been, the whole deal. It's totally different. 

I think the biggest point for me was the mental prep for conversations and the realization on your part that when someone is talking to your partner, it's still a group conversation. I think that's the part he misses, that he can jump in any time and he knows what we're talking about 90% of the time so he COULD if he didn't feel like he would be stepping on toes. 

And I do agree that part of it is my fault, but sometimes I feel like I try and he just doesn't respond. It's hard to like warn him ahead of time that I'm going to bring him into a conversation if I don't know where the conversation is going, and when I try to bring it to him he's just so self-effacing because he KNOWS he's not as social as us and he feels like his conversational skills aren't up to par. It's literally just this friend group that has a problem though - other friends we have love him, they know he's quiet but they talk to him and ask him questions and we have a great time. He's got some old friends who are even more social and talkative than my group. It's frustrating. He thinks of this group so much as MY group of friends that he wants to let me have time, but I don't want that. 

I think I'm going to have to have a good talk with Dan and see if this is what's happening and if this is the cause. I have a feeling it is but I could still be wrong. Either way I do need to have a real talk with Sam about maybe putting in a little extra effort with this group so they can have a better relationship with him, and I can offer to help him as much as he'd like. And you're right, I should just put together a thing whenever I can and let Sam have another shot. I'll have to figure out everyone's schedules and all that but I'll make it work. Thank you!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> See I was thinking about that, but Mark and I are fine in person. His girlfriend and I get along well, Mark talks to Sam and I (maybe more than anyone else in the group talks to Sam!) and it would be weird if it were over some crap that happened 5-6 years ago since we're all fine now. 

I typically make plans through Dan, because he is more social than I am and some of this other bigger group I don't really know or have only met once or do. I have attempted to make plans upwards of six times in the last eight months, each time things don't work out or people are genuinely busy or working. I get that, we all have different jobs and days off, and I'm busy planning a wedding too so I don't always push too hard to make plans after I get a lackluster response. 

Dan's girlfriend is also fairly new - maybe a few months - and she does talk when people ask her questions, I remember that, same as Sam. But I think the issue is that more people actually try to include her in conversation because they don't already have a bias against her and she's super nice.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been brushing this off for a while but tonight it really came to a head. 

I have been with my fianc Sam for almost six years. He's not necessarily super shy or awkward, he's just a perfect example of a "man of few words". He is a passive participant in conversation in groups. He often is quiet when I'm with any of the few friends I have because he wants to respect my time with these people and wants to let me talk and catch up. If he gets brought into a conversation he will gladly talk about things but he doesn't interject into a conversation he's not already in. In private, we talk TONS and I know him to be a very weird, funny, loving person who values the people in his life. 

I went through some health issues a few years ago, coupled with some crippling depression. It sucked. I'm over it. But it caused me to lose a great number of "friends" around the age of 22 - plus, I just quit the whole party scene and wanted to find friends who actually cared. All told, I have maybe ten people I can consider good friends. I went to a wedding a few months ago for an old acquaintance from high school and reconnected with a few people from high school there too. I should mention we're all fairly talkative on social media, mid-20s, nerdy kids with similar interests. We have done a few things together in various groups over the last few months alone. But more often than not, especially as a large group, they are doing things without me. It hurts! I'm not gonna lie, I know I'm a little weird but these people have always known that. One of them is my oldest friend on this planet, Dan, a guy I consider my brother - literally going to be a bridesmaid in my wedding! And it's around him that I sort of place the most blame. 

Backstory - another friend named Mark and I in the group almost dated a very long time ago. It was a rough break and it was right before I started dating my fianc. Mark never wanted to officially get together and would play it cool even though I knew he had stronger feelings for me than he would admit out loud - the guy basically lived at my house for a while, he was a great guy but it didn't work out. We stopped seeing each other, I got together with Sam and got fairly serious very fast. Mark and I got into a huge fight a few months later over him saying some awful things to me. Mark is kind of a jerk online. I don't put up with his stuff anymore and don't really consider him a friend anymore, but I am always friendly to him in person, we hug, we catch up a bit, he's fine. He's actually dating a girl I've known since elementary school who is pretty cool too. She and I have hung out, we talk online a bit, she is actually the person who most often tries to include Sam and I. She knows there's weird history but she knows we're also sorta friends so she doesn't care. It's all civil, so why dwell on the past? That kind of thing. 

So Dan is my concern here. I wanted Sam to meet Dan fairly early in our relationship because Dan is a big part of my life. This was before Mark started turning into a jerk, so the four of us went out. Mark, Dan and myself all have a very weird rhythm when we hang out. We talk very fast, we make very odd references and jokes, the whole shebang. Remember how I said Sam lets me talk to my friends and hangs back? He did this. He talked sometimes too but even if he wanted to, it's tough to just jump in on that kind of conversation. He laughs when he understands stuff, it's not like he's EVER just sitting there on his phone or not paying attention to things. He's just quiet. 

Dan's a fairly social, open guy though. So from very early on Dan apparently thought that Sam just didn't like him, and he didn't like Sam much because he thought that Sam wasn't making an effort to get to know my friends. I told him he couldn't be farther from the truth, that Sam liked him a great deal and could see why we were so close. Dan was skeptical. I totally understand that part. Nobody who knows me would ever expect me to be with someone so reserved. But Sam is honestly my best friend on this planet and I wish people could see the side of him that I do. 

But now it's been several years. Dan and I hang out solo more often than with Sam because Dan wants that. Fine. But Mark and his girlfriend are not the easiest people to get along with but I am still very friendly and warm in person. It's just how I am. The girlfriend and Dan and I have hung out together. It's not a big deal. The couple whose wedding we all went to? Them too. And Dan has a girlfriend now who I have met and totally liked off the bat. But she is also kind of quiet. Which irks me in a way that it shouldn't, because that's why Dan doesn't like Sam, but that's almost beside the point. 

These three couples, and a few others that I only sort of know, do stuff together all the time. Tonight they posted this group picture of all of them at an event that we all mentioned going to together. I was never told about this at all, obviously. 

I don't understand why. I still talk to a majority of these people often. I don't see any of them as often as I'd like, even before Sam and I got together, because we're all leading very different lives and we get busy. I'm having a small wedding but the friends, minus Mark and his girlfriend because I see them much less and they KNOW that's why, the rest of them are  coming. There has never been any sort of disagreement. I constantly encourage these plans. It's not like they don't want to be my friend, because I still actively talk to them about all kinds of stuff. Pretty much at least once a week I talk to most of these people. 

The only thing I can think of is that it's because of Sam. Because they think he doesn't like them, or because they think he's a jerk because he doesn't talk. I don't know if this might have been perpetuated by Dan, but he is a talkative person so he might have talked to one or two people about it, they share with their significant others, suddenly the whole group just thinks Sam's a jerk because he supposedly doesn't want to talk to them. They're all very social people. I am too. Sam just needs time to warm up to people, but if he's never given that opportunity, it won't happen. Like I have said many times, these people are all very cool with me. Just no invites. 

And it's not an issue of like "oh the whole group went to school together" or anything. Mark, Dan, myself, Mark's girlfriend, and one other guy did. The remaining 6-8 people did not. People who have expressed that they'd like to hang out with me, the ones I haven't seen often, but... still nope. I don't know if it's a conscious "don't invite Kate and Sam" or if it's just that they think we wouldn't want to do the things they do, which is bogus because we've both expressed interest in these things. Or maybe we're just left out because we are busy maybe 25% of the time we ARE asked because we have a wedding to plan and four sets of parents to deal with. Maybe they assume we're busy? But Dan knows we don't do much socially without these people, and he also knows what days I always have free. Dan's girlfriend also expressed interest in another double date at some point,  which I would love, she's super nice and I'd like to get to know her more since I've really only met her once when the two of them met us for dinner. Dan instigated this dinner so it's not like he never makes plans with me, we talk less than most people would say of their close friends but we have always been that way, we talk less day to day but we have always stayed super close and very open and emotional with each other. I know he wanted me to meet his girlfriend and things went well. 

I'm stumped. There have been real, actual arguments between Mark and his girlfriend and Dan, rude things said between them. But they get invited out? The girlfriend is pretty social, yeah, so she probably reaches out to make plans. I have tried several times. Some of the time the dates honestly don't line up, people are busy and some of them work weird days, but several times I've been sitting on my couch when they all post pictures. I'm hurt in a stupid, shallow way and I feel dumb even wondering why they aren't hanging out with meeeee. But that's the way it is. 

On one hand, I think I need to talk to Dan about this. I can be honest about how hurt i feel about them leaving us out, and how it upsets me that, even if it's not WHY we're left out, that he hasn't been willing to give Sam a second chance. It's totally unlike Dan to act this way. I know once he knows I'm hurt he'll talk to me. I don't know how to go about it though. 

On the other hand, I don't know that it will change anything. If people are already against Sam, they just are. I can't just keep pushing to make plans and keep being disappointed that we're not included in the group. It's hurting me. It feels dumb. But some of these people make up a majority of the friends that I'm inviting to our wedding. How can I still want that if they don't even want to hang out with us? I'm torn between continuing to try, then getting hurt, or just giving up entirely. But I don't want to lose these people as friends. We're friends! But I'm not going to commit to going solo to future events if Sam is the problem just because they won't give him a chance. 

Any advice on the matter? Does it seem like my assumption that it's about Sam could be true? Or am I missing something here that I'm just not seeing because I'm too close? 

tl;dr my fianc and I have been together six years, but my friend group all does stuff without us as couples. I think it's because fianc is quiet and my friend group is very talkative and social so they think he's aloof or doesn't like them. Couldn't be farther from the truth. We all talk online so I feel like it's not just an issue with ME since they aren't distancing themselves from me personally, they just almost never extend invites to my fianc and I. Not sure how to proceed.

I don't want to be thinking about the crappy things my sister said while I'm walking down the aisle.

<TEXT> I finally figured my diet out by some mad combination of part time veganism and antidepressants. Most meds make you gain weight (cravings!) but I specifically wanted one that would not because I was just inside the obese range and trying to get healthy. That it came before my wedding was a nice coincidence. 28 pounds down so far, 40ish to go before September. I've been losing 2 a week for the last six or seven weeks but before that it literally took me a year to lose ten pounds, so whatever. And idk if it's because I'm getting older or what but my skin decided to stop acting like I am 14 again and is not full of acne so that's cool. 

Meanwhile, my fianc eats half a pizza and loses weight. And my sister drinks giant sugary Starbucks drinks and pasta and whatever the hell else and goes out drinking a few nights a week and she's tiny. I subside on lentils and my hopes and dreams.  </TEXT>

OP, there are a whoooole lot of ways to deal with having a crappy MIL. MILs don't have to be irredeemably insane for you to need coping mechanisms. Mine is sort of similar to yours but in a weirdly overly polite way while also being one of the rudest people I've ever met. It's amazing to watch.

 Yeah my dress ended up being drastically different than what I wanted at first. I wanted a big poofy dress! Then I remembered I'm getting married literally in a forest and that it would be warm. And that sparkles are itchy. And I also want to pee by myself. So. Ended up with BHLDN's Genevieve. The farthest thing from a strapless poofy sparkly dress that I could humanly find. I tried quite a few non-white dresses, and ultimately I looked a little funny (VERY pale, dark hair, curvy... I looked like cotton candy with hair on top) but I loved a pale blue dress I tried.

So I made an appointment for as soon as I could, and instead of focusing on that MOMENT and having my sisters and girls and stuff around me, I just brought my fiance and tried a ton of different stuff on just to make SURE I knew I wanted that one. Tried on like twenty dresses, and yup, I did still want it. Put it on the card, signed the paperwork, and that was it. No major fanfare. I trusted his opinion and we both liked it, couldn't find anything wrong with it, matches our wedding/venue perfectly, and was half my budget.

<TEXT> Sounds more like depression than BPD. I'm not a doctor, but I am in a family with a broad history of mental illness, several of which have BPD in various stages of treatment. Some not being treated at all. Mania is not something you'd gloss over, the manic feelings aren't just changing your mood, it's being so wired and high energy and on edge that you can't sleep, can't focus, aren't thinking rationally. It can manifest in a few different ways - anger, excessive need to show happiness, sexual dysfunction, all kinds of stuff. 

A lot of what you have described sounds like what I have dealt with in the past. I am in treatment now for depression, as well as some poorly controlled anxiety issues and some raging PTSD from a shitty childhood. I didn't recognize PTSD for what it was until my therapist suggested it. Sounds like you've been through some shit too, and it can change how you see the world and how you interact with it. Detachment is something I deal with all the time, I do and think and say things that don't match up with what I know I should do or want to do. Many people see me as "happy" even though I have been fairly open about my mental health issues. I, too, felt the void. I was the void, the void was me. I saw no way out. Until I realized that I needed to find a way out before I ended things. 

I feel very cynical most days, but I have found that it's less about cynicism and more about an analytical approach to how i see the world. I am constantly remembering or in fear of something that has happened or could happen again. I can't feel "normal" because I don't behave normally. Most people are not this distrusting. I also feel the need to flaunt my successes, and that's more common than you'd think. Especially for people who have been through childhood trauma, the desire to be better than that and to get past that is SO strong. I have about four people that are currently keeping me from just packing up and leaving my current state. I don't hesitate to brag about the newest positive developments in my life. I have distanced myself from everyone associated with the more negative parts of my life. I want to be someone else, but I can't be, so I at least want to be as far removed from the OLD me as possible. 

From where you're standing, it's also very very normal to be hesitant about therapy or to feel the need to lie to your therapist to make things seem better or worse than they are. You can't manipulate a therapist. It's very very hard to make them think things about you that aren't true. I thought I was calm and cool and mine read me like a book at our second appointment. I'm glad she did, because I'm making progress, but even after that appointment it took me several sessions before I had an appointment without at least one major lie. 

Anti-depressants have totally helped me, though. I thought I could never be fixed, but I also knew I couldn't continue to be that miserable and empty feeling about my life, so I figured I'd give it a shot. Took the happy pills. It's actually been a good few months. It CAN get better. Your school probably has at least one good resource, and if not there are usually youth resources in any decent size city. Not always, but usually. Might take some digging. And once you're in college, there are tons of student resources to help you out. It is a pain in the ass to drag yourself out of the void, but it's better than being miserable forever.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It would depend on whether or not your therapist thought you were in danger of actually harming yourself. That's when intervention happens. For example, I've been fairly open with mine about suicidal ideations and the way I have been feeling when I'm at my lowest, but I know it's just that - ideation. I don't have plans to kill myself, I am actively working on my mental health, and that's enough for her. But depending on your situation - diagnosis, age, living arrangements, social history - a therapist can see it as more or less of a red flag based on what they know about you. Most of them have heard "I want to die" or some variation of that SO many times, thousands of times, that they know when they need to escalate and get you more help than they can provide.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Be direct. And it may take some time, some men are MUCH different than others. My fianc is emotionally stunted (or rather, was, he had a weird family dynamic growing up so he never really got a good feel for personal relationships) and the first time I told him I wanted more romance he was so confused. Didn't we just go on a date last weekend? Yeeeees but I planned and executed the whole thing, and the ten dates before that too. We worked on it for a long time, and I had to keep reminding him because honestly, some dudes will then put in a huge burst of effort and they'll see that it makes you feel good, and then they'll stop trying so hard because they think the problem is fixed. But FH now knows what to do. He doesn't always do it, he's a software engineer on top of being a weirdo, so sometimes he forgets that making me plan everything does not mean that I'm feeling appreciated. But he tries. Some men will, some won't. If he doesn't even try, or even want to really talk about it, move on. Pretty silly to stay in a lackluster relationship.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Same! I used to be a product hoarder and tried everything I could afford to get my hands on. Then I got lazy and stopped washing my face as often as I should (like 3 times a week now?) and my skin got better... so I dropped my other products too, and I've never had clearer skin. Now I just wash and use either a moisturizer in the morning or the admittedly bougie Drunk Elephant Framboos Serum at night. Never had better skin. What. So counterintuitive but it's like my skin is saying "thank you for dropping the Clean and Clear scrubs and harsh BP creams, now I'll calm down"  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I will never understand the parents that force their way into hospitals when their kid is having a baby. The kind of grandparents who feel they're entitled to everything. 

My dad is a prime example. My sister had her baby, open adoption so the mom was there with her. Baby's mom says our family is welcome to visit often (they go on vacations with my mom's side of the family and stuff like that!) but that home visits needed to be only one or two people at a time. Totally understood. Nope. My dad insists that his wife comes with him - the wife that sobbed and begged my sister not to put the baby up for adoption and made her feel extremely guilty for a very personal decision. My dad won't go unless his new wife can go. My sister explains that this is not her rule, it's the mom's, and they need to be respectful or they won't be able to have a relationship with him. 

Guess who hasn't met his grandson? Yep. And the kid is turning 4 soon. Four YEARS my dad has let his ego trump basic decency. Sigh.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I almost never do it. I think I've stayed home two total days in the last nine months. I always feel kind of bad but my MB is a doctor/currently a medical director for an organization, so she gets health stuff. I nanny for 3 though and the littlest just started preschool, so if I took days off every time I was sick, I would never work, lol. I've been sniffly since October. 

And actually, the two days I took off, SHE told me to take off. We're Facebook friends and I mentioned having an awful head cold and she called me like "you know you can stay home if you're that sick, right?" And basically made me stay home. And the other time I legit had the flu and had been toughing it out for a week already but I was miserable. She texted asking how I was doing and I was honest. I felt like I'd been hit by a truck. She was like "rest up, don't worry about it, see you Wednesday!"

I still feel guilty lol  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Give your sister a super ultra high five for me. My own dad was pretty okay growing up, had a LOT of issues that really came to the surface when he and my mom split when I was 18.  He's a loser. He's always been a loser. I was just too little to understand. 

He moved off and started a nice little life with his new wife and her two daughters - all very similar to my mom and my sister and I. Hmmmm. But to them he's Super Dad because their old "dad" was a total piece of shit. Newsflash, folks, he seems great now but wait until he starts abusing pain medication again and has explosive anger issues and starts hitting people. From what I can tell, he's juuuuust starting that process again now that he's on "disability" for his "shoulder problems". Ugh. He has also lied about my sister and I hating him to his extended family - which we never get to see, because he never invites us. I only know this because I ran into my great aunt in the grocery store before my dad's wedding and she made a comment about how she hoped we'd be at his wedding. We were literally in the wedding. All four daughters were "bridesmaids". But he hadn't told them that part, couldn't fix that part, because everyone else thought we were just some bitches that hated him. 

My stepmom is kind of an ass too, but she's not all that smart, and the girls are brainwashed by the both of them. I see my dad maybe twice a year, if that. I always initiate meetings. He doesn't ever try to contact me. He said some fucked up shit to my sister a few months ago but she said she's over it. 

He's soooo lucky he's invited to my wedding as a guest. That my sister allowed that to happen, because honestly it  was up to her. 

I think of him as an old friend that I don't really talk to anymore because we've drifted apart, but that I might barely regret not inviting. 

Females standing up to family that is supposed to support them... kicking ass despite the cards they were dealt... that's the real shit.  </TEXT>

But unless she's a serious body builder/competition level athlete, there's no way she's hanging onto that much muscle. And if she WERE an athlete, she wouldn't have big natural breasts to begin with (low body fat? Small boobs!) and also, she wouldn't have to be defending herself as "not reeeeally obese"

It comes in white and one or two other colors, it's high enough that I'm sitting at the right place at my vanity, but it's nice and square and relatively compact so it easily fits under a vanity and goes ALL the way under. My vanity currently has a small trash can underneath and a stack of shoebox storage, and this stool still fits easily.

My fianc didn't believe me at first when I told him about my mom and all that, then we had to live with her for a few months for financial reasons and he was like "oh wow it's even worse than you said before". She would never get violent with me when I was back in, but she would often just verbally assault me when she didn't know he was home. Always fun. She realized he had caught on to her shit from very early on. I have been sucked back into having a relationship with her faaaarrr too many times, and he's always the one to say "you know what, no, fuck that, just stop talking to her" or "what a bitch!" while I'm upset because she lured me back in to use as an emotional punching bag again.

<TEXT> Fellow C-PTSD person (I'm actually only recently diagnosed and it makes sooooo much sense), fellow Wellbutrin taker. Also depression and ADD and what we used to call a panic disorder but is def related to the PTSD problems caused by mother dearest. 

This is a gooood place to be, this sub. I've been on Wellbutrin for several months now and it has totally changed my life. It's insane. It doesn't work for everyone, but after an initial period of side effects, it has been like night and day. My relationship with my mother has been difficult since... probably my conception, honestly, and maybe before that too. She's a real character, my mom. 

I'm 26, it took me a long time to admit that what happened to me was abuse, even though I knew intrinsically that parents should not beat or psychologically punish their children. It actually took me until about last year, so you have a jump start on me! 

Letting it all out like this is cathartic in all the best ways. The internet is great for this. I love tattling on my mom because she always loved to air my dirty laundry in front of EVERYONE she came in contact with. 

Joke's on her, she's fucking crazy and everyone knows it and she has systematically ruined a majority of her relationships with people and everyone knows exactly why I stay as far away from her as I possibly can. 

Also my life is great now that I am not bogged down by depression and I'm learning to manage a few of my C-PTSD problems. I mean, I am still not skipping through fields but I can wake up and shower in the morning! I can hold a job! I don't want to die! I have three reliable, awesome, non-family relationships, including my fianc! Previously my behaviors were... not conducive to monogamous relationships. But intense focus and work has changed me for the better. 

If you ever want to vent/mindlessly bitch about mother problems together... I'll bring the popcorn.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I started taking 150mg of a generic I got from Kaiser. I barely had any side effects and I felt great, so we upped my dose a little and I felt even better! 

I have been taking the 300mg for probably two months now. I unfortunately am going to have a gap in my kaiser insurance, so I had to transfer my prescription out to a different pharmacy. Which meant a different generic. 

I feel TERRIBLE. I have depressed thoughts throughout the day, constant high anxiety and near daily panic attacks, I'm nauseous and vomiting, I'm constipated, my stomach feels like it's being torn from my body, I have a constant headache, my body aches so much, I am shaky and just totally out of it.  

I have read online that different generics can cause this problem. I just don't know how to fix this. Do I just call around and get a refill with whatever pharmacy has the old generic? I can't keep this up. I feel almost like I did at my very worst, mentally. I had it so good. I want that back. Or I at least don't want to feel like my body is being ripped to shreds.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My HG is Toni and Guy Wave Memoriser. Naturally, it was discontinued in the US, but there are various overseas shops that still sell it. I use about a penny sized circle for that one and scrunch into soaking wet hair. It's the texture that's great - thicker/smoother than gel, nothing that dries my curls. Gels always make me... frazzled. Not sure how to describe it. 

I have also used Miss Jessie's Pillow Soft Curls to some success. Kind of depended on the weather, for me, but my hair is super finicky. Anything that is a semi-thick, squeezable "styling cream" might work. Right now, because it's drier, I'm using MoroccanOil curl defining cream - maybe a dime to nickel sized amount. 

The same procedure applies - I find my hair responds best to products when my hair is still really wet. My shampoo and conditioner routine is all over the place (another discontinued product, UGH) but I always spray It's a 10, separate the bigger sections, scrunch in a bit of styling cream, and then I take a microfiber type towel and scrunch the water out, and it also removes excess product for me since my hair is thin and doesn't need too much! I put extra so I am sure it's even, but probably at least 1/3 of it comes off when I scrunch dry. 

Hope that helps!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, everyone else has already given you the justnomil suggestion, but I'm going to add this: I'm not sure how your finances are arranged, but if there's any separation in spending money, tell fianc that if he doesn't want to enforce the house rules and can't say no to mommy, he gets to pay for the carpets to get cleaned next time. Or even better, he can clean them himself. 

My FMIL is kind of loony and has a lot of "rules" like this too. "You can't ask people to do ____!" She talks about things being rude but is literally rude to almost everyone she encounters. FH used to be a momma's boy, and I put up with that for a few years, but then I stomped that shit out pretty fast. Drastically cut down how often we saw her. She didn't come over. It can take a while, but these guys need to realize that mommy isn't the most important woman in their lives anymore.

<TEXT> Obviously the experiment quote was a bad move on his part, but it's not uncommon for people to feel this way. Analytical people and people who have been burned before (or just some people in general) tend to search for very specific things in a partner. After some time, they may realize that these qualities are too restricting/not as desirable as they initially thought. They "experiment" by going outside of their "type" and they either decide "I like this" or they don't. 

My relationship was like this. In the beginning, I was kind of attracted to my guy, mostly I liked that he's really tall, but it was too easy for me to say that he wasn't the hottest guy I'd been with. But I continued to date him because he wasn't my "type" - he's quiet and reserved but a little goofy, where my type was very social and confident - and I wanted to know if the maturity vs "type" thing would work out. Ends up my type was not made up of people I wanted to be in long term relationships with. Over time he became more attractive to me because I started to appreciate him more and more. Does he know this? Yes. Did I tell him I wasn't attracted to him and he was an experiment? Hell no. That's a little insensitive. That's like saying "you should feel so appreciative that I kept you around! Everything worked out!" Which is crap. 

Are you still an experiment? Highly doubtful. If he's admitted to crappy thoughts but wants to marry you, he wants to marry you. But you have to let him know that this really upset you, that you are deeply hurt by it, and that he needs to make it up by not doing shit like that ever again, and by showing you that he loves you, and really does want to be with you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Awesome! It's so satisfying to defy the crappy financial setup that is expected of you. My parents have terrible credit, we're constantly in debt, couldn't get a loan at all, spent like crazy. I had adopted those practices as a teenager but when I moved in with my fianc (then boyfriend) he helped me get my stuff together. I only use credit cards to build credit, I have never had a late payment, I pay my balance completely every month. My mom thinks it's practically a miracle, like it's just not possible for your average person to do that! 

I had a 720 credit score by 22 and have slowly built that up to 760. Feels good. Congrats on paying off your debt, that's so awesome!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, he needs mental health services. He may think he's fine because it's "just his parents", but his reaction to his parents is something that terrifies YOU. He can't keep the two situations separate and claim everything is okay, because you being forced to watch him explode is putting a lot of stress on you. You shouldn't have to feel startled and afraid because he won't make an appointment to talk to someone. 

I have a lot of pent up anger regarding my parents. They were not the best parents growing up, they were abusive many times. I luckily don't have to deal with my father much anymore but I still have to see my mom all the time. She makes me feel powerless and weak, and LOTS of therapy has made me realize that. She tricks me, twists truths, does things I've specifically asked her not to. I am a small disabled woman so getting physically angry is not a real concern, but I throw my phone all the time and sometimes other small things within my reach. Lots of therapy has made me realize this sucks, but I still feel this incredible burst of anger. So instead of getting mad wherever, I go into another room, stomp my feet, throw balled up shirts at the wall, and then go talk to my fianc. Is it a good fix? No. But it's miles ahead of where I used to be, which was letting something my mother did affect several days of my life and make me an ass to deal with. But I take mine into the other room. My anger is my problem. I haven't yet learned how to deal with my mother. But I'm not making my fianc watch me get that angry. It's not his fault, he doesn't need to see that. 

I think when you talk to him again you really need to drive it home that he cannot possibly separate the two groups of people (his parents and you) because his problems with his parents are causing YOU distress and scaring you. If he tries to say "I would never get angry like that with you!" Again, tell him that you might believe that, but even if he never once got angry like that with you, you having to suffer the effects of his violent outbursts is just as bad. What if his physical anger resulted - even by accident - in physical harm to you? He can't guarantee he can control physics. He kicks something with you around and it hits you? That's not okay. 

He's hurting you, emotionally, and he won't admit it. Tell him you refuse to let him hurt you like that. That you love him and want him to feel his best, and you want to work together, and that means finding a way to end these outbursts so that you aren't feeling afraid of him.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like another commenter said, eyeliner seems slightly off. My only other note would be that your crease color could come up a little higher - with hooded eyes, you tend to lose the color unless they blend it farther up. The shading is so pretty but it needs to be more visible! 

Also I saw you mention a lipstick sealer thing - for me, they just NEVER worked. I just looked dry and wrinkly. Some work differently than others though, and there's always a lip mask/heavy moisturizer in the weeks leading up to the wedding. 

The colors are so nice on you though! My own trial is in just a few weeks and I'm freaking out lol  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yayyyy! I'm so glad things are working out. The dress can be difficult but it is a VERY pretty dress, and when it actually fits you correctly I'm sure it will look gorgeous! I love the top of your dress and the transition around the middle - it's super pretty and flowy and ahhhh 

I expected to be in a tizzy about dresses. Since I was young, I dreamed of the big frothy ball gown with the corset laced back and the bling. And when I started trying on dresses, that's where I started. But I'm getting married up in the mountains and having a much less formal wedding than I thought I wanted. And like you, I'm losing metric shit tons of weight (I'm only 25 down right now, hoping to lose another 35-40 before September), so dress shopping is doubly difficult because how am I supposed to pick a dress for a body I don't know? That's why I'm going with BHLDN. I live near a store, so I can try stuff on whenever. And their stuff isn't special order. If I ordered a wedding dress today, I'd have it within a week. I'm not actually going to wait until it's that soon, I'm watching it like a hawk to make sure it doesn't go into backorder, but I can wait until I have a better idea of what size I'll be. I want to show off my waist, damn it! Okay, okay, rambling. But this similar dilemma is frustrating and ahhhh 

For reference, the one I liked best when I started was BHLDN's Hayden. The one I'm looking at now is BHLDN Genevieve. The only thing the OLD dress has in common with the NEW dress is... it's a dress. That's about all. Lol.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seconding BHLDN. They're also not special order so you can order closer to your date if you want. They have a gorgeous tea length (at least it's tea length on me, lol) dress named Saylor that is To. Die. For. I'm obsessed. I'm probably wearing the Genevieve for my actual wedding but I want to buy the Saylor just for... rehearsal? Brunch? Idk it's gorgeous. They also have some white/ivory "bridesmaid" dresses that would work for a casual bride. 

I saw a post a while ago with this insanely pretty goldenrod yellow dress, I think it was Sarah Seven so, pricey, but it was a simple, solid colored gown. I think a simple evening-type gown and a few accessories can easily look bridal, with hair done up and all that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's like you're me only my sister is saccharine sweet to me in front of family and a shit communicator and a weirdo on our own. She and I are still... friends? We were closer when we were younger actually but she turned into a mini version of my mother. My mom had a rushed wedding to my Marine father when she was 20. They divorced a while back. Mom and sister have both had a lot of shitty situations arise in their lives, I got lucky in many aspects (like, I'm grateful I have chronic spinal pain instead of the emotionally turbulent lives they have been shoved into...) and FH and I have been together and lived together for almost 5.5 years, so it's been easy(ish) sailing for me for a while. 

FH and I have divorced and re partnered parents. Three sets are contributing. And my grandmother is also contributing. So, we've got a decent budget. We're planning cool stuff and a badass honeymoon. My mom and sister are pretty blunt about jealousy. My sister is only 23 but she's still green. My mom just sort of broke up with her long term partner so she's... well she's always dramatic but this actually sucks. 

I feel bad for being happy sometimes. And also worried. They both have made promises that they clearly do not intend to keep. I am basically quietly doing the work for them and just including them where necessary so I don't stir things up too much. But I'm not holding back my excitement and enjoyment for them. You and I are allowed to be happy!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Google Amaroq. The crown I'm having made is basically a cross between the Caia crown with the spikes, but with the addition of some copper elements, and the Caleniel comb elements - tons of greenery and flowers, crystals, the spikes, metal fun stuff. Her custom stuff is generally between $250-800, and I was expecting to pay something like $600-700 but I'm probably looking at more like $350. It's an absurd amount of money to spend on a crown, but at this point I'm not feeling overly inspired by any dresses, so I'm basically having this bitchin' headpiece made and finding a comfortable/affordable dress that goes with it.

<TEXT> Hahahahhahahahaaaaa 

You know when you reach that level of annoyed where you start to feel invincible and nobody else's opinions matter and people's concern is comical? 

Mentally I am sipping a martini, atop the iron throne, blowing raspberries at anyone who wants to have an opinion about anything. 

I reached zero fucks a few months ago. Everyone had their opinions, everyone had Things To Say. FH and I have had a very clear opinion of what we want for this wedding, pretty much since the beginning. No compromises. Four sets of parents? Too many differing opinions. We haven't expected anyone to contribute financially, we basically just said "thanks if you do, it'll help us have an awesome wedding" and away we went. 

Still. People have tried. Phrased as "questions" or "I wonder if you guys could..." or "you should...!" 

So I have literally stopped responding to people's questions. If someone asks, I just say "oh, you know wedding planning! We're working on it!" And change the subject. 

We had our second tasting today and I basically said "fuck it, I want the drink station and the coffee station and the short ribs and three extra hors d'oeuvres and the gold chargers! And the special lemonade! I want it all!" And FH raised his eyebrows but he knows better than to come between me and food. 

And then my mom started getting on me about a bridal shower and kept trying to pester me about a theme or some shit, and I just told her "mom just literally go check Pinterest, I have like zero friends and you know what the family members like" after she apparently picked and booked the date without me even knowing. I literally growled. GROWLED. Not on purpose. Just this... guttural noise of disapproval. And told her I needed to be included in big decisions. She can throw the shower if she wants, but it miiiight be nice if the bride can actually... be there. Maybe. 

Good news: I have been drooling over this designer who makes these gorgeous crowns and headpieces for... a while. They're these beautiful natural things with preserved flowers and greenery, crystals, fun metal ornaments, metal spike things that look super pretty. Like a crazy woodland fairy queen. I finally bit the bullet a few weeks ago and emailed her hoping to get a custom piece. We start working on it. And I brace myself for the quote... and it's half what I was expecting! So I'm going to go even a little fancier and I guess I'll pick whatever dress matches the crown best. And my sparkly keds. I do not care if I look like a weirdo. I AM a weirdo. Everyone who knows me knows this. 

I keep telling FH: if there's not at least ONE good candid of me stuffing my face while I'm all done up and pretty, I will be disappointed. Photog, get on it. 

Weeeeeeeeeeee  </TEXT>

At least, that's how it works here. I'm assuming there's something similar in other places.  </TEXT>

He read it in a few hours and called me, rambled on for like ten minutes (he's practically nonverbal otherwise so I knew something was up). He picked me up, explained how he realized how different we are and how we're just not speaking the right languages. Of course we're not going to feel great when we're not getting the type of love that we want most. Disagreements and problems have been handled a zillion times better since then.  </TEXT>

Degenerative is kind of an off term to use for it, but basically I have fluid filled cysts within my spinal cord and up near my brain stem that cause a bunch of nerve problems/weakness/dizziness/numbness, and it's slowly getting a bit worse as they grow a little/my spine moves (I'm losing weight, which we're not sure if it's helpful or harmful but either way I need to lose more weight.) Luckily mine isn't too bad! I can still walk and move fine most days, but as I get older I could get really weak and have problems with limbs. I shouldn't need a wheelchair probably ever, but things get tricky. I need MRIs at least twice a year, I have all kinds of maintenance pain management things.

<TEXT> I turned 26 in February, so technically I'm supposed to get kicked off of my mom's insurance. 

However, I've been treated for a degenerative spinal condition since 2012, and recently started medication to help with some awful depression. Just in the last few months. Things were looking up. I just had to get some paperwork signed by my neurologist. Except she kept fighting me on it. I've only seen her for a few months and I don't have my FULL history so she wasn't sure. I was really afraid she wouldn't sign it. She's kind of... tough, I guess. 

She signed it! I picked it up this morning, I have to fill out one more page and send it in and then I'll keep insurance! I don't have to go off my antidepressants! I can stay in care! I'm getting married in September so I know I'll have insurance then, but this will bridge that five month gap and keep me healthy!  </TEXT>

Case in point - about a year ago, my depression got really bad and I decided I needed help. Medication level help. I told fianc about it and he seemed really hesitant but couldn't explain why. He admitted he was scared that it would change me, and I was scared of that too... but two sessions talking about it, he FINALLY admits that there was a relative in his family who committed suicide after going off meds without supervision. Such a HUGE thing! But he had a hard time verbalizing it and that's why he was so scared. It opened up the dialogue and now I've been getting the help I need and he's been supportive the whole way through. Therapy can be straight up magical.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My FH was like this at first. Hesitant to get married, didn't want to go to counseling, the whole thing. I eventually told him he could go to counseling with me or he could call off the engagement. I hate putting out ultimatums but he was a TERRIBLE communicator and I tended to get dramatic. It's just how things were. 

Fast forward a few months - we hated our therapist (or at least, I did) but she helped us think about the important questions and gave us a neutral space to air our concerns. That was the biggest part for my FH - he was afraid to speak his mind because I'd throw a fit and cry. Jesus. Thinking about it now, I don't know why we did that. I have a myriad of mental health issues that I was not treating at the time but it was no excuse for how immature I was. Now I'm getting help and it's much easier to be reasonable. 

Anyway I'm rambling, but I think presenting counseling in a different light might help. My FH refused to go to counseling for two years. I kept giving in and saying okay but you get to a point where it is necessary for some couples. Present it as a neutral space. It doesn't have to be the condescending premarital counseling that everyone expects. It can feel crappy and dumb but it can help you become more in tune with each other's communication style. 

Tell him that if he refuses to have a real conversation with you about his reservations with getting married, you need to escalate it. It's mediation, not punishment. 

It saved my relationship. It totally did. I always thought of us as being basically married, but with those problems in the way, we weren't ready yet. Now I KNOW we're ready. We've gotten so much closer, and I didn't even think that was possible before we fixed stuff. 

He can either: 
A: help you pick a date 
B: commit to having real open dialogue with you about why he's hesitating, and work on a timeline with steps to get there 
C: go to counseling

<TEXT> Cycle breakers 

I am so proud of you. Fighting against the circumstances and way of life that you've been born into is so so difficult. 

I am in a similar situation. Women in my family have a history of not getting treated for mental health issues and being... interesting moms. I wish my life had been normal when I was younger, but at the time I didn't know there was any other way. One side of my family was poor hicks who didn't care about their health at all. The other were middle class white folks who turned a blind eye to bad parenting. Maybe it skips generations. My great-grandmother was not the best mom to my grandma. My grandma was an awesome mom to my mom. My mom was a nightmare and I'm glad I can recognize that now. I'm so terrified of having children because I don't want to be like my mother was. But I am getting active treatment for my depression, PTSD, anxiety... a whole laundry list of problems really, but I'm thriving now that I trust doctors and am on the right meds. 

I am the first woman in my immediate family/some others, that hasn't been pregnant by 21. I am the first (besides my grandparents, again, skipped generations?) to have a loving, supportive, non-crazy partner. 

I am seen as the weird one because I don't fit into their weirdo norms. But I'm okay with that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not who you commented to, but I issued an ultimatum to my fianc a year ago. I told him he could go to therapy with me and work on our communication issues and his harmful criticism or I would leave. We did the therapy thing but once we got to a certain point, we realized we were solving our problems better AFTER therapy rather than during. It helped us figure out each other's communication weaknesses. 

Telling him how he made me feel sometimes and that I would not continue to be with someone who made me feel like that opened his eyes. 

He's been committed to being a better partner every day. I forgave him, and that's how I can continue this relationship after we had to go through that whole thing. Ultimatums don't work for everyone, often the person on the receiving end is too stubborn. But it's worth a shot when you're at the end of your rope but willing to give it one last push.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I drove that point home this afternoon. I was like "I literally just got through the worst part of a binge eating disorder, I am not going to let your shitty comments over-correct me to the point that I don't eat." And he was like uhhhhhhhhhhh ok sorry I won't do it again. wanna do better. Blah blah. I told him next time I want a treat like that to look at it for what it is - is it a single donut? I can have that. Am I stockpiling ice cream and brownies and sushi and steak and cheese? Help me knock that shit out. Really easy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hahaha it's funny you say that, because that was his suggestion. "What about the salad bar? Or something premise?" Yeah, like a 1000 calorie sandwich? Or a 700 calorie salad? I'm not eating dry lettuce. And I explained that to him and he was like bu-but... nutrition! And I just rolled my eyes. I eat vegan 6 days a week, I meticulously plan our healthy meals. He knows it. 

He later admitted he was wrong (I have in the past asked him to help me - when I am engaging in DESTRUCTIVE behavior, aka not a single donut) but he's a little... emotionally naive, I want to say. He had a weird childhood and never had a relationship before me. And I'm a bit of a handful. But still. He went too far. 

Still gonna treat myself at some point today or tomorrow and just stare at him while I do it to make him uncomfortable. Mmmm.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In that case, it kind of sounds like grandma was either completely mislead and doesn't understand that this is not your normal deal, or that she knows how her kid is and wants to make it easier on you. 

How long are you stuck there? If it's only a few days... might be better to just grin and bear it for that amount of time. If it's longer than that, you need to talk to MB. This is pretty unfair. 

My old NF started slowly adding more and more chores onto my plate. I was basically just supposed to make sure kids (9, 11, 13) had breakfast and lunch and clean up after that. Then it was "can you throw in a load of laundry?" And it snowballed. I was too timid at the time to say anything. Soon I was coming in for extra hours during the day to catch up on laundry for the whole family. I should not have been putting away laundry for a high school freshman who was a little turd. But the mom was generally super nice while the dad was a total tool. It was hard to say no because I wanted her to like me still. 

Eventually I had to just go for it. I told MB that I was really uncomfortable with the amount of chores DB was asking me to do, and that he now expected to have done every day. I reminded her that I was hired as a nanny, not a maid, and that I would no longer be expected to do laundry for the whole house. That was it. She and DB were a little miffed, but it was easier to just accept that than fire me and find someone else. 

Don't feel like you HAVE to do anything. If you feel like you want to help/grandma is nice enough, I suggest finding a way to be in the kitchen during cooking so that you can clean up along the way. This is how I do things at home - I am known for making big messes when cooking. FH would rather clean up behind me for fifteen minutes than spend fifteen minutes afterwards cleaning up the bigger mess. Ask grandma if there's a way to sneak in and do stuff like this. You might want to frame it as "I'm not used to doing this amount of cleaning when we're at home, as I'm a nanny and I'm usually spending my time taking care of the kids. Is there a way we can work out a short list of things I can do to help out, so that once I'm done I can have some down time to rest?" She'll probably work with you. 

Next time MB yells at you though, just go total stone face and let her know that she has put you in a really uncomfortable position and that you'll have to discuss what happened when you're all home. She IS paying you, but she doesn't get to suddenly change your job responsibilities. She is paying you as a NANNY. Not a maid.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can you take a bus home? Buses are cheap. Not public transport, a real long distance bus. Or is there anyone near where you live that could pick you up? If you can manage it, do it. Just get out of there. That sounds awful. 

If not, I would do this - speak with the grandparents. Let them know that you're not sure what their daughter told them, but that your contract states you're only to clean up after the KIDS. You're a nanny, not a maid. Let them throw a fit if they want to. If they don't respect your job title, that's their problem, but don't keep cleaning up their huge messes all day because their daughter said you would. If they brought you on this vacation to clean instead of care for kids, they did it on purpose. There is clearly a "nanny will clean the house!" deal going on here. 

You can always remind MB of your title too. Nanny, not a maid. You clean up after kids, not adults. If she wanted you to clean her parents house, she should have asked about that beforehand, but holding your pay over your head and expecting you to just clean anyway is really shitty. 

Once you get home... find a new job. It sucks to leave a family but it's worse to be taken advantage of and treated like crap.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My cheeks and jaw get itchy all the time. I find myself washing my hands constantly to keep them clean... the other obvious being to clean anything out from under your nails - even if you have super short nails and don't think they're dirty, they accumulate so much junk in so little time. One scratch and you're not only messing with the skin by scratching it, you're basically injecting bacteria into those spots with your nails. Yuck. I also learned to itch small spots with a knuckle, and bigger spots by gently scratching in an outward motion, for less fingernail drag. Like... instead of the scratching motion being dragging your fingers inwards, you push the TOP flat part of your nails closer to the skin and drag just a little. 

I used to have awful acne on my cheeks... learning to not touch/touch safely saved my face.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's really not a big deal. They were probably super embarrassed when they realized who it was, and once one person pretends they don't know the other one, you just kinda go with it... it's hard to go back from that because it seems like they're hiding something, but it's not that bad. You know it was from a long time ago. It's highly likely that they had a fling, it didn't stick, they hadn't seen each other since the old days and were so shocked they just ignored it. 

I met my fianc through one of his really good friends, who I was hooking up with for several months. Everyone knew. I had even previously slept with a different one of their friends, but that was a one time mistake (ugh) and that was before I met all of the friends. Nothing ever really went anywhere with it, we stopped seeing each other but stayed friends. I noticed my fianc from early on but he's shy so we didn't talk at first. Hookup invited me to a party at his house, and I wanted to see the friends so I went. Ended up meeting fianc for real and we've been inseparable since. He's never cared, he knows I had partners before him. 

Think of it that way - you know your buddy had girlfriends. You know your wife had boyfriends before you. It doesn't have to reeeeally mean anything that they knew each other. You are totally justified in being upset that they lied. But unless it's going to end either your friendship or marriage, it's not worth getting mad about. 

I would say you should sit her down, explain you're not mad but a little confused. Tell her about the picture and explain that you just don't know why they hid it. She'll probably be mortified, she may snap at you (even if she didn't do anything wrong, being embarrassed can make people defensive) but just explain that it doesn't change your relationship, you love her, it's okay that they used to see each other, it's not a big deal. 

Same with your buddy. You don't need to tell him you love him though. Just tell him you secondhand saw the picture, you're not mad, you just don't know why they hid it but it's fine. Just that you know now.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My FH and I had some issues over the last few years. Anyone in our place would. He had some awful, manipulative, dangerous friends, he was naive, he had never kissed a girl until we got together when he was 23. I got sick about a year in with a chronic spinal condition. One of his friends changed how he behaved in our relationship. He's always been a bit... robotic. He's a software engineer and is all about efficient systems and organizations and perfect balance sheets and I can barely find matching socks in the morning and often waste my spending cash on bullshit. I have made strides to be more responsible, I was making an effort, but for a year or two there he was being kind of a dick. He was still super affectionate and loving but basically shut off emotions when it came time to have serious conversations and would say things that he later realized were awful to say. (Much of this behavior comes from his mom, who is very big-picky and didn't want us to ever share finances or whatever and makes rude comments literally everywhere she goes. He was a momma's boy when we got together. Not anymore, lol.) 

I almost left him. But I stuck with his weird ass and kept putting in work. I reached a point where I wasn't sure he was going to change. I very seriously thought about leaving, the logistics of it. We were in therapy but it was making things worse. 

And then something flipped. Like, night and day. We got in a fight one night and I went to my mom's. He didn't know what to do because I wouldn't come home until he was ready to talk, so he actually read one of those dumb self help relationship books (in one sitting. Seriously.) and it really opened his eyes to how different we are and how what he was doing (and not doing) was depriving me of the basic benefits of a relationship. 

It was a little rocky at first, we still have minor disagreements. But he's been MILLIONS of times more patient, understanding, supportive, the whole bit. I don't know what exactly did it for him. It took three years (of a five year relationship) for it to really happen, but it has. People do change. People do put in the effort. Some of the things he said and did were things this sub would tell me to leave him for. But I knew it wasn't really ever out of malice. He just didn't know how. Then he did. 

We're planning our wedding, it's in September in the mountains. We're splurging on food. He came to watch me try wedding dresses on because I trust his opinions more than anyone else's. He's absolutely the person I was meant to be with. He was not my "type" at all, and is quiet and analytical to my rambunctious and spontaneous. It took us a while to find the same rhythm. But we did it! Success story! And we're stronger for having been through all of this together. He shows emotions with me now. He is attentive and considerate. He is still at times infuriating and a bit of a weirdo but he is my weirdo, damn it. Nobody shoots my buddy but me! 

I am just so happy every day that things worked out. I got so close to leaving, several times. That was always my response in prior relationships. Flight. This time I chose differently because some crazy little part of me decided this was worth everything. And I am soooooo glad I did.

We're not going super formal so idk if parents are even walking down. Probably my mom, his mom. And his dad and stepmom. Anyway, I knew a long time ago that I was going to tell everyone that they could pretty much wear whatever they wanted. Our wedding party is all VERY different in size, shape, height, all of the above. Super. Just try to stay in this vague color palette, you're great. 

But I hadn't yet told FMIL this. But she'd already decided to buy a green suit. 

Green. Suit. Not sure what shade, but... ok. Good thing I don't actually care. She can wear what she wants. She's a little odd anyway.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oof. Sounds crappy to say it this way but honestly, it's the best outcome. You stayed strong and her lack of response and half-assed "apology" proved that you were very right in doing so. She didn't value the friendship enough to not be the center of attention during your wedding. That stinks. But you'll be better off without her. 

One of my "bridesmaids" is my best guy friend. I've known him since we were five, he's a little... out there. His fashion sense has always been a little funky to begin with. I have always loved it, the dude is not afraid to be himself EVER and really helped me with my own confidence. When I asked him to be my bridesmaid he kept saying he was going to wear a dress. Some of FH's family (and all of mine) would have been totally cool with it, but the rest of FH's family would have made a stink about it (fairly conservative gossipy old people who think their word is law and that everyone should know their opinions every fucking second. But it doesn't piss me off. Nope.) 

I explained to him that a dress wasn't really going to be in the cards but that we could find him something special to wear. He could wear a pink shirt and sparkly tie, some shit like that. He totally understood and then proceeded to tell me he wanted to get a ruffled baby pink tuxedo shirt. I know he likes a little extra sparkle and a plain suit or some shit is not him AT ALL. I told him to go right ahead, as long as his girlfriend matches and/or throws on a feather boa. Just enough to rustle up the old people. Just enough.  </TEXT>

And naturally, he's not going to expect that there would be any feelings between his wife and his best friend unless they mutually gave him a reason to be suspicious. I feel like the husband either knows his wife is a little kooky/too emotionally invested in his friend and trusts it to never come to fruition, or... he doesn't know at all, and this is all just some weird thing that's happening.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, blunt is sometimes the best way to handle things. I was ready to call it quits with my FH about a year or so in because my schedule had to work around what his mommy wanted. We were sometimes over at their house or having dinner out with them four times a week! It was so excessive and stressful. I kept trying to hint that it made me uncomfortable but he kept ignoring it and saying he felt bad and he wasn't going to ignore her. Uh. SO not what I was asking. Then on top of that, she kept trying to convince him to co-sign a loan (because she knew she wouldn't get approved, even though she's got money) so that she could build a second floor to her house. So that FH could live in it. With me and our future kids. Just when I was saying "hey can we spend LESS time with your family?" He tells me he signed the application. 

I finally got fed up with it and said "fine! Go ahead. You help her get that loan. Make sure she builds a nice second floor suite. And then have a nice life, because if you're moving in with her, you're doing it alone. We are adults in a relationship living on our own. I just escaped my parents, I don't need new ones. We need to have our own adult lives.  This is not normal." 

Somehow, plans for the loan and build fell through, and the schedule started changing, and we saw her less and less. Hmmm.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right, but there's no way to prove that the family wad aware of this before they hired OP. The AGENCY said she would be paid for holidays and vacation, not the family. The family may have never heard that line or agreed to it. Agencies and families don't have any kind of universal agreement to when nannies should or shouldn't be paid. Some work differently than others. Obviously the parents didn't agree with it (verbally or legally) since they refused to pay federal holidays. 

I think the only party that really took advantage of the lack of contract is the agency. Asking the family to pay up for the agency's crappy practices is what's not professional. Agencies sometimes have really shady practices - they tell nannies they'll get vacation time, sick days, holidays, this rate of pay, yadda yadda. But they can't really guarantee any of that without a contract. So they get girls to work through them with promises of all these benefits, then they don't have to deliver when a contract is never written or signed by either party. "Oh, it's just what you COULD get."  I had an agency do the same to me. Told me I'd make $20 an hour, 30 hours a week, paid sick days and holidays but unpaid vacation. That's what a family was offering. Sounded fine to me. Only when I went to go in and sign it, suddenly "the family" would only agree to $15 and no sick days or holidays. Yet, the family wasn't there when I went to sign the contract. Uh. No. I left those guys pretty quickly. Shady.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My dad did this to me. I was young, he didn't really let as much of his N flag fly as my mom did at the time. They divorced and I moved in with my boyfriend. I found out I was sick, couldn't work for a while. My dad offered to give us some cash to tide us over for a while. Cool. Part of their divorce agreement was also that my dad would give me $2k to help me get a car. He gave me $1500. Whatever. Still helped us out, though there was no way we were buying a car at that point. 

Literally three years later, he gets "laid off" (he got fired, I'm 99% sure of it, since he's happened to get "laid off" four times in four years, I shit you not) and asks when I can start paying him back that money I owe him. Um. Excuse me??? No. I tell him that he was very adamant that the initial amount he gave me was a gift, he repeated over and over that we didn't have to pay him back. And that the second part I DEFINITELY wasn't supposed to give back as he was legally supposed to give it to me. I was barely getting back to work at that point. I told him I could give him $50 a month, to help him out, but that there was no way I could return all of that to him, even if I wanted to. 

He said "don't bother" and didn't speak to me for six months. When someone shows you who they really are... that whole thing. 

He also promised to help pay for sooooo much shit when I was first talking about getting married. My dress, the rehearsal dinner, all kinds of crap. Then I actually got engaged and all of the sudden he's laid off again, he can't really help pay for anything but they can help plan! (And it sounds awful, but he and my stepmom's taste is all caps TACKY. no thanks.) at this point, he's lucky he's even INVITED to the wedding. Honestly at this point I expected him to do that, so I never really expected a contribution from him. 

Oh yeah, and during all these periods of time where he was destitute and needed to try and steal money back from me? They've managed to buy four new cars in five years, they don't pay rent living in her mom's house, they go on trips constantly, and he's always talking about some cool new gadget he bought. 

Good job OP, I wish I would have learned this lesson ages ago.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's what brunches are for, lol. You're right in saying that it would be rude for the couple not to attend. 

We're getting married up in the mountains. Most guests are staying Friday through Sunday. The big main house has a big kitchen/room off to the side, so we're going to make big batches of scrambled eggs, bacon, maybe pancakes or something. Put out juice, coffee, and muffins. Nothing fancy. We're even reusing some of our decor from the night before. We're just giving people a two and a half hour window where they can show up. Then it gives people time to shower, pack up, whatever, and swing by for some food before they depart. We'll be there for the middle hour and a half, spending time with people and making sure everything is packed up and ready to go at noon. 

Is there any other reason besides "alone time" that he doesn't want to attend? An hour and a half to spend time with people who just came to celebrate with you doesn't seem like anything terribly inconvenient. At a friend's recent wedding, they let everyone know that they could convene in the hotel restaurant for breakfast, show up between 8-10, and that they'd be there for the first hour before leaving. Easy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with hounding the agency because it is THEIR mistake, but there was never any written or verbal agreement with the family that they pay you on days you aren't there. You already knew this. Sitting down and begging them for money when they've already made it clear they will not be doing so does NOT look good. They have benefits for their jobs because they have written, signed contracts from their employers that outline those benefits. Begging them for "wiggle room" is unprofessional. They said they would pay you when you're there. Clearly. You can't force them to do otherwise. 

But a bigger part of this IS the agency, since they stated you would be getting paid for this week. Get in contact with whoever handled you and let them know that since they never presented you/the family with a contract to sign, your family is refusing to pay the week's vacation and that you're now expecting compensation from the agency to cover that vacation time. You can discuss with them the issue with federal holidays too. Do you have any written record of the agency promising this? That's going to be your best bet. If not and it was some verbal promise and they never came through with a contract, that's going to be really hard to prove/make happen. It may have even been on purpose. Some agencies like to lure in nannies with promises of bigger checks and better hours and benefits and then they just don't deliver. It's shitty, but it happens.

<TEXT> Yeah, don't let your parents opinions dictate how you plan YOUR wedding. Different people have very different opinions. FH and I both have divorced and remarried parents, so we have four sets to deal with. Three of the four of them have OPINIONS (My dad and step mom want some kind of backyard rager with too much alcohol and not enough food, like theirs was. My mom thinks I'm crazy for getting married in the mountains and is very picky about accommodations. FMIL wanted us to get married in a park next to a freeway, lol.) 

FH and I got financial contributions from his mom (who, when we were firm about having a nicer wedding, had a ton of CBF but stopped pushing), my mom (who is now trying to kiss up and saying she loved everything from the beginning lol) and HIS dad and stepmom (who are contributing the most out of all the parents but their only big opinions so far have been "it's your wedding, do what you want" and "sounds cool!") 

I'm rambling at this point but basically put it this way - the whole traditional "parents make big choices" thing is waaaay outdated even if your parents were helping to pay for your wedding. Since YOU TWO are the sole financial contributors, it's up to you. 

What does your fianc say about this whole thing? Does he agree with you or with parents? It can be hard to fight a partner on it (mine initially wanted something very small and simple) but if you're both in agreement, it's easier to be firm with parents. I basically told FH the same thing - we only get to have one wedding. I don't want to regret anything about it or make any decisions I don't like just because one set of parents didn't like it. I'm not willing to compromise on a once in a lifetime event that's about US.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, this. And it will only get worse when it's her graaaandbaby instead of a dog. She can claim ignorance or think she's bringing treats to a dog, dog gets sick, she keeps doing it. With a baby? Yeah, no. This kind of behavior will be amplified. She'll think she's got a right to give baby whatever she wants to/do things against parent's wishes! And why? Because nobody ever told her to stop with the puppy! 

Personally, I think you should handle this, but not in a "fine I'll do it" sort of way. Sit down with your husband and ask how he would feel if she fed something to your child that made kiddo sick. Would he just not say anything, even when it was bad enough that you have to take baby to the hospital? (If he says it's different somehow because it's a dog, that's a whole different ballgame of disregard for animals, but I digress!) Let him know that NOT putting your foot down now will just pave the way for future rule breaking, and that you would be uncomfortable with MIL around baby if she's just going to ignore your rules and do whatever she wants. 

Let him know that you will not let his mother trash your decisions with no repercussions at the expense of the suffering of a living thing. There are two ways this can go: he can talk to her and let her know that the dog is no longer allowed table food, and let her know about the vet visit, explain that he understands she feels like it's a treat but it's actually making him very sick. Or YOU can talk to her - in the form of handing her the vet bill for the treatment of your dog that is HER fault, and maybe not being as gentle with her as he's being. He can let this go either way. She'd feel less attacked hearing it gently from him than aggressively from you. It's his mom. If he'd rather spare her feelings than spare actual suffering of a living being, do not have children with this man.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good to know other people feel this way... I'm in the process of losing 80ish pounds and I am avoiding seeing people who haven't seen me since it started, until my wedding in September. I'm 25ish pounds down now but I had really gotten uncomfortably big for my frame and didn't see any friends during that time. I'm hoping to just avoid everyone else for the next 5ish months and then... bam! It will have to be noticeable. Haha. Irrational, but I feel the same way. I think you and I both might benefit from finding a little more confidence in the MIDDLE of our journeys, not just the end! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lmao, I feel you. My FMIL spent the entirety of a weeklong family camping trip making it seem like I was a total idiot. First of all... I've been in Girl Scouts/literally leading camp workshops for troops for 14 years. I have been camping several times a year since my birth. I am not new to camping. And her "camping" is hardly camping. She liked to point out that I didn't know where things were. (for reference, she brings like fifteen buckets of shit, sets up two different stations for... things? And also brings herself a five gallon bucket with a toilet seat so she can pee in her tent in the middle of the night. The last one isn't super relevant but it's gross, lol) 

Then, when I spent the first three days firmly reminding her that I am feeling just fine, I just don't do breakfast on vacation because I take forever to fall asleep so I like to sleep in... then she says "oh! Are you drinking enough water? You're drinking plenty of everything else..." assuming I'm some kind of dehydrated idiotic alcoholic who hasn't been chugging water (and yeah, okay, vodka crans too... but they were necessary.) 

Ugggghhhhhh. This is the woman who asked me to help her clean out her massive horrible crap filled spare bedroom and make sure she threw stuff away. When I tried, she made it seem like I was asking her to throw away her most prized possessions. Over shit like a pair of shoes she bought ten years ago and literally never wore. And then complained to everyone that I was making her throw stuff away, but also that I wasn't helping (??!) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, it's about emotional maturity. Some people you can deeply connect with almost immediately. Some people just don't feel that same level of comfort or connectedness. I have some friends that I've had for 10+ years that I consider good friends, but nothing else. I have very few close friends because I don't like wasting time with people who don't genuinely want to help and love others as I do. But the couple of close friends I have are gold. The others... well, it's nice to have a beer with them now and then but I don't think I'll still be talking to them fifteen years from now.  </TEXT>

We'd been dating about a month, spending a LOT of time together (like, I was staying at his place 6 nights a week, we went out all the time, blah blah) and hadn't put a name to it. Then randomly one night at a friend group Christmas party, one of his friends called me "FH's girlfriend" and then we got quiet and he was like "oh shit, have you guys not had that talk yet? Whoops!" Later that night he was like "soooo Paul called you my girlfriend..." and I said "well, yeah, I think that's kind of what we're heading for here" and now like five and a half years later we're getting married! At one point we told Paul that his comment is kind of what made us talk about it and he was like "well I mean you're both pretty awkward so I did you both a favor."  Bless.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Binge Eating was somehow harder for me to talk about than abuse and anxiety and depression and night terrors. It sucked to finally admit it because it's such a loss of control on it's own. I don't remember what post I was reading the other day, but the poster said the part of them that binged was just some small primal part of their mind that wanted to consume everything and protect itself. So they gave it a name. And whenever they wanted to binge, they said "oh, I don't really want to eat all of that, that's (insert name here) talking." And honestly it was a big step for me in realizing that my bingeing seemed to come from an entirely separate sector of myself, and that's why I had had such a hard time with it. Our instincts are sometimes wrong. It's actually been freeing to talk about it. I almost didn't want to post but it's good to get out there and it seems a lot of people relate. 

Have you tried writing it out? I came forward about some abuse by writing a single sentence on a post it and basically chucking at my therapist. Bit of a crude method, throwing things at a therapist, but gets the point across.  </TEXT>

I was frustrated at first too because I had hoped to feel a dramatic difference instantly, despite my dr telling me that was not likely to happen.

Now I know why people are on antidepressants. Holy crap. Night. And. Day. And if this med doesn't work for you, try another! It can take a while to find what works for YOU.

I started with like 15 minute guided meditations, and then I found a 30 minute one that completely blew my mind. Totally changed my meditation game. This is the one that helped me realize that my mental health was a major road block on the way to my goals. And then I kept digging and found different methods of meditation and the other day I just zoned out and did my thing and looked up and, whoops, there went an hour and fifteen minutes. I normally can't sit still for more than ten minutes so that was amazing. Revelatory. And Yoga and I might get along better when I've gotten a little lighter/stronger, as currently all that happens is I fall on my ass, so...  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Then partner, I know where you are, I've been there, and I'm telling you - it CAN get better. It is HARD and you have to accept some crappy truths about yourself, but it helps. I decided to skip straight into dual therapy and medication mostly because I know that in the past when dealing with my anxiety in high school, I was not always 100% truthful with my therapists. I can't get the help I need if I'm lying because I don't want them to think I'm weird or 100 other things. My family history with mental illness has shown both positive and negative interactions with therapy, medication, and hospitalization, and I decided the benefits far outweighed the risks and that it was worth a shot! And I'm so glad I did it! You can always go back OFF meds, but the decision to start meds ASAP rather than wait was a necessary one for me. And don't hate YOU. Feel free to be unhappy with your choices, but if you've already made the decision to work on yourself, you're worth it and you're awesome!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had warts on my hands and knees as a kid, and once when I was 12 I tripped and landed right on a medium sized one on my knee. It bled like crazy and then it spread out to over an inch wide in either direction. My doc was like "what did you do???" And then laughed at me. I used to get the liquid nitrogen treatments and they helped quite a bit, but they hurt so bad I cried. He'd always take the little bit of leftover liquid and throw it on the ground and say it was magic. Poof! Which made me roll my eyes because I was 12 but secretly I thought it was pretty cool and he knew it, haha. 

The tape thing, I had totally forgotten about until you posted it. Duct tape mostly. Sometimes medical tape. Hurt like a bitch if it pulled stuff. 

You know how they finally went away? I stopped trying. I figured "oh well, I guess I just have them forever." I would tape it now and then (like once a month) and pull stuff off and it hurt, and at one point they just healed up. Haven't had one since. Weird.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My parents are the same, but I'm mostly VLC with my dad and stepmom and stepsisters. My parents try to get along but if we're being real for a second, they hate each other and they're like petty teenagers so I had to basically sit them both down (separately) and say "you don't get second chances. There will be no drama surrounding this wedding or you will be asked to not attend. I am not afraid to kick you out in the middle of my reception. Do not test me." But then, I've spent the last five years forging myself a pair of giant steel lady balls in the fire of my annoyance and fury, so I know it's not easy for everyone. 

Next time your mom talks about traveling in, or the time around your wedding, mention how crazy things are and how grateful you'll be for the week of alone time during your staycation, and how you and FH will be so glad to have some peace and quiet. If she insinuates that she wants to visit for longer than you want, remind her of the staycation and alone time, and how it's basically your honeymoon at home and you'll be busy being together. 

As far as the days before go, same deal. Mention how busy you'll be, bring up appointments or errands you have to do and how you'll barely be at home or have time to rest. If she presses, tell her that because of all the family drama, you organized to do everything yourself so that there wouldn't be any claims that you picked sides and wanted one parent's help or presence more than the other. There's a middle ground here - save boring monotonous stuff for them to do the day before, if they want to come in a day earlier. Make it clear that this won't really be time to hang out and rest, that if they're here early they're going to have to bear some of the burden of preparation because you can't not do the prep. 

Good luck. Ours is September too and I've already realized I'm waaaay behind on planning.

It took me until I was 25 and had been out of the house for 6 years to actually call it abuse, because there was no way my parents were abusive, right?

<TEXT> Yeah, don't let squealing teenage girls in high school talk for the grown women you'll encounter now. In high school I probably would have also said it was "weird", but I'd never even seen one in person. Teen girls are also very hive-mind-y, if one of them says "that's gross!", they're all going to agree even if they have no clue about the reality of things. 

As a woman who has seen a decent selection of dicks in her years, I'm gonna spit a little truth. Two of the best lovers I ever had were the two guys who were uncut. Because of anatomy? No. Because they both had confidence. Both of them basically gave a small disclaimer before things got sexy and said "hey, I'm uncut, I don't want it to be a surprise but it's just how I am. Everything works exactly like it should." And oh man, did it. 

It's not an easy 180 to magically become comfortable with some part of yourself that you're nervous about, but you have two options - build confidence and learn to own it, or just avoid having sex for the rest of your life. Easy choice.

<TEXT> First off, I would read the shit out of any blog or book you happened to pen. As a young woman with depression, panic disorder, PTSD, and ADD, I love hearing about other's experiences - not because of any "ooh wow fun" factor but because I like hearing about other "crazy people" who live their lives despite the fact that their own brains are raging against them. People who haven't had to deal with mental illness up close tend to see "crazy" exactly how you've described, which is awful, but the more visibility we get, the better. 

My fianc and I have been together 5 years. I never thought I'd actually find someone to "put up with" my four kinds of "crazy", but, here we are. I am still teaching him things. Even those closest to us struggle to understand what we are going through. I only recently got the RELIEF of a PTSD diagnosis after years of knowing something "else" was wrong with me. I had a rough childhood and grew up in a shithole and I couldn't figure out why I constantly lashed out at people over stupid shit or why I needed absolute silence when I slept or why I have trouble forming and keeping relationships. When my therapist confirmed my diagnosis (and to be honest, I wasn't surprised) I cried. And I cried when I told my fianc. And I haven't told anyone else because there's so much stigma around it. His whole family has no idea that I have any mental health issues. They just know I spend a lot of alone time, even on family trips, and that I sleep a ton. 

It may never objectively get easier, but slowly, we become better at ignoring the bullshit and focusing on getting past our demons so we can shower and eat. 

Thank you for sharing your story. I'd love to hear more.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We had something similar happen recently. My usually stoic fianc suffered a tragic loss in the family. This is the man that has cried in front of me maybe twice before - both when my depression had gotten terrible and he was upset hearing how bad I felt about everything. He does not show much emotion - happy, sad, angry, whatever. This loss hit him really hard though and was so unexpected. He kept putting on the blank face and acting like everything was going to be fine, but we got home and he just lost it. He's in a good enough place that he's not suicidal over it but it scared me seeing how upset he was. 

I can't even imagine being in your shoes right now. If you need to vent, I'm free any time. Don't forget to take good care of yourself in the mean time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is awesome! I am proud of you! I suffer from binge eating disorder and it got to the point where my weight was affecting my health. I also suffer from depression, and most anti-depressants can make you hungry/make you gain weight, which I was terrified of. My doc worked with me to find the one that would make me NOT do that. In fact, we found one that helped REDUCE my urge to binge, and I'm proud to say that, even though medication was sort of the "easy" way out, I haven't binged in almost two months. Feels so good to be mindful and to recognize when the bad feelings are coming, and to let that urge pass and not act on it. You've had to work harder than I did, so, major props! Keep it up!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> I had to pull up my pants all day today. It's the first day I've felt like I've lost "real" weight. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-18 01:29:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have an odd shape no matter what weight I am - giant hips/butt, narrow waist, big thighs but small calves, tiny ankles and feet. I'm like a caricature, at least I definitely was at my heaviest weight. I was 206 some time this past summer at 5'7"ish. 

I bought these jeans several months ago. My old jeans were too tight, I was devastated. Couldn't even squeeze into them. Went in, managed to find two pairs - both high waisted, but one was VERY stretchy and one was not. I've been noticing lately that the stretched out pair is loose, but they shrink back up in the dryer and are fine for a wear or two. They're mostly like yoga pants. (They do have weird stretched out bumpy spots though, which I find amusing.) 

These pants, though. These were a little snug even when I bought them. They are only mid-rise, I think, which usually means a giant gap at the waist when I sit down. I rarely wore these jeans in the last few months, mostly because I still couldn't really see or feel my weight loss. I decided to throw them on today as I was running late, and oh, man. 

ALL. DAY. I had to pull these babies up. Not like, fall-off-my-hips loose, but definitely LOOSE. They started to sag a little in the butt. I had to make sure I wasn't flashing crack to innocent bystanders. The kid I nanny for kept laughing at me for my "big jeans". My biggest jeans were actually a 14, these are just a barely stretchy 12, but yeah, they look a little looser now. 

I weighed in this morning and I'm 17.3 pounds down. 188.7 lbs. I haven't been sub-190 in well over a year and a half, maybe two years. I suffer from depression and Binge Eating Disorder, which obviously has made weight loss extremely difficult. I finally sought help and have been slowly working towards getting my mind and body back in shape! It's not some massive success story yet, but I'm getting there, one crappy pair of loose jeans at a time!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> FH and I are going to be there Sep 16-23 for part of our honeymoon. We're coming up on the date to make our ADRs, but how do we plan which park/restaurant to go for if we don't know the dates of the party yet? Like, I want to book Be Our Guest but how do I nab a reservation if I don't know what nights will or won't be party nights? Do I just have to guess and check based on what it will allow me to book on certain days? We'd prefer to not be in MK on party days to avoid crowds, I'm guessing. 

Any tips or info? 


Edit: also, California grill - if I'm trying to book that on a day off from the parks, how do I know if I'm going to be seeing the regular fireworks or the Halloween ones? Also, is there a schedule of any kind for AM and PM magic hours? Certain parks on certain days? Trying to optimize.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Haha, so, the funny thing is, mine is that and also backwards but I've been wanting to vent so here goes. 

I was a very hyperactive child. Not the run around in circles and fight people kind, the cantstopfidgetingohmygod kind. My mom worked in education and decided to have me observed by the school. They tell her it's because I have ADHD. Okay. So she takes me to therapy but tries to weasel her way into every appt. The therapist realizes this and starts asking me "you're big enough to have this appointment alone, right?" And I would always nod and my mom would always do and say awful things to try to get me to fess up as to what I had told the doc. I think she was taking me for appearances, and to tell the therapist that I was just acting up for her, as she did and does often. She kind of realized that taking me might backfire because the therapist wasn't an idiot. Guess who magically got better and didn't have to go to therapy anymore? Yeah! Me! And then when I was still hyped out of my mind and couldn't write a single sentence without wanting to die, she would say I was just being lazy/whiny and being bad. She would say that I did it at home too, but only when I had to actually focus and do things but that she was sure I was faking it. The other teachers at my school, where she worked, believed her. Son of a bitch. 

Later, when I was 11 and already showing signs of depression, she would scream at me for crying or for not being cheerful about some bullshit that I hated or for not immediately praising her for things. When I really started to retreat into my room more, she would yell that I deserved to be there anyway and I could stay there until I grew up and got a better attitude. I was self harming by 13 and miserable and she didn't give a shit. 

I was in an awful place by the time I was 13, but I kept up appearances alll the way until Junior year. I was in clubs, on teams, I was doing just okay in classes. Then I crashed. I failed all of my classes and they made me go to a special school where I could make it up. I knocked two years of classes out in six months. Without a full class of people, I could focus! I could go outside and do my work and finish a weeks worth in an hour and a half! I went back to regular school with enough credits that I could have already graduated, but I wanted to go to prom and stuff so I went back. My mom had zero interaction with this school. None. But the weird thing is she would tell me how proud she was of me for working hard to make it up. She almost never put me down for being in that school. The ONE thing she should have gotten mad about. Nope. W

So here's where it gets funny - she used to kick me out allllll the time. For various infractions. I think I was 14 the first time this happened. And then she'd call and beg me to come home and say she was sorry, and I was a fucking idiot doormat so I'd walk home with my tail between my legs and she'd cry and hug me and then the next day she'd be yelling again. (Guess who's bipolar? Yes! My mother! But that's actually only a little relevant.) She would tell everyone at school that she didn't know what was going on with me, that I'd just disappear sometimes and not answer the phone and wouldn't tell her where I was going. School counselor called me in. By this time my mom didn't work for the district anymore and had switched careers. This counselor, who had already thought I was lazy and awful for having to go to the other school, mostly ignored me when I told her my mom was actually kicking me out and had hit me several times in the past and committed abuse by taking away "privileges", some as easy as TV and some like "laundry and shower". Didn't care. Thought I was acting up. 

Enter - me, 19. I am flunking my second semester of college after barely scraping by in the first. I hate college. I feel like an idiot and I'm not as put together as these other people. I flunk out and start working. I meet my FH just before I turned 21 and moved into his place 2 weeks later. His roommates all bail. In the interim, we have to find a place to stay. Guess who has the only open room in town? Yep. At least FH got to experience how she treated me. She only did it when she thought he wasn't there, but he's quiet. He saw and heard everything. 

We move out again. At that point, I'm 23 and completely unsure if I was actually ill or if she'd twisted it all up. It takes me two years to get help because A: I am scared and  B: it takes me that long to actually call the abuse what it was. 

Turns out I'm not only ADHD and have full on depression, but I also have a panic disorder and show many signs of PTSD! Yay! I don't obviously tell her any of these. 

In the last two years, she has started pretending we have a great relationship now and she's always talking about how I'm "sooo much better after getting help" and that I was a terrible and difficult child to raise because of my ADHD and mood issues. 

The fuck. You claimed that I both did and did not have these things. Made them worse. Kept me from getting treatment and turned my teachers against me. And now you're saying I was difficult because of the illnesses that you couldn't make up your mind about? 

Ugh.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh my god, is your mom my mom? Minus the guests thing because our #1 rule was "we write the guest list, we're not expecting contributions to our wedding so anything you give us is appreciated but doesn't buy you extra seats". So glad I put that one out. FH's family is MASSIVE and my mom has many interesting "friends" that I do not know that I'm sure she'd love to be able to show off to. 

My mom, who wasn't even married to her guy, said his daughter counted as more of a stepsister than my actual stepsisters on my dad's side. Uh. 

My mom is the kind of person who wouldn't make the grievous error of wearing white or doing anything tooo over the top, just grating awful selfish wicked little jabs all the time that wear me down that nobody else sees if they're not paying attention. 

She also does the fake stories thing and then claims I don't remember them correctly or that I was "so young". I was a dumb teenager and got arrested for petty theft when I was 18, it was super embarrassing and I'm not that kind of person and I had a really stupid (but in my head, very valid) reason I did it. Anyway, I have told FH about this, he knows I was a bit of a wild child but that's my only reeeeally real brush with the law. She was having dinner with me and FH and some family one night and like out of fucking nowhere brought up my "law breaking habit" and said I stole stuff and that I used to steal her things all the time. (Partially true, we were a big house of girls and all borrowed each other's shit. But she also stole my shit that I bought with my own money then said "you're under my roof, it's mine.") right after she brings this up, she gave herself whiplash doing so I swear to god, she looks right at FH expecting some horrified reaction. You could see the immediate cat butt face when he had zero reaction. At all. Bless this man.  

My mom also has been telling everyone she's "sooooo surprised" that I didn't turn into "a total bridezilla." First off, bitch. No. I may sound angry in these rants and I use a lot of vulgar words but I am literally the chillest motherfucker in this family. Everyone's all "what should the bridesmaids wear? What color are your tables? What kind of guest book are you getting? Do my kids have to dress up?" And my answers are 1. I literally do not care what anyone else wears, their body not mine. 2. Table colored 3. What? and 4. Your kid can wear a friggin batman costume for all I care, in fact, let them pick out the weirdest outfit they want and flaunt it." I always dreamed of having a big fancy wedding when I was younger but then I turned 22 and was like "lol, you fuckers will be lucky if I don't elope." 

My mom promised us $4k and I haven't seen a dime. She is contributing the LEAST of any other parties. She did buy a small percentage of our decor and she drove me to one of my dress appointments. Ok. Then she demanded the best room on site at the venue for herself because she "just really needs this right now." 

Not much advice for you other than what FH tells me - moms like this make promises, but set your expectations low because she's probably only going to deliver on what she wants to do. Don't leave her in charge of anything you can't live without. And when in doubt, buy more wine. (He's a wise man, my FH.)  </TEXT>

If you don't want to tell for your own reasons, tell to save some other kid from having to suffer through the same thing or worse. 

Also, as someone who had something sort of similar happen to me as a child, pleeeease go to therapy. I was 9, I am now 26, I am just now getting help and I wish I had gone sooner because it does have an impact on how you form and keep relationships.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So many recommendations, ah! Thanks for all the lounges and things - I wasn't even thinking about places to grab a drink. We're definitely going California Grill and will look into the luau. No way we're dropping that kind of money for Victoria and Albert's. It's not that we can't, but I'd rather spend the money on drinks and fun stuff than on one meal. 

Disneyland dole whip is 100x better than WDW dole whip. No clue why. I was actually really surprised at how different they were. And Morimoto's sounds good too, that's our kind of food (I could drink a gallon of Thai tea. I would probably be sick afterwards but I'd do it anyway.) 

And I think that's what we're going to do with the split. AK seems like it's got more things that we'll want to be there for later in the day. We'll probably go back for Fantasmic one night though, as it's totally different than the DL one and soooo much easier to see!  </TEXT>

I feel like our tastes are pretty varied and we'll eat pretty much anything. Last time we went, we did peel away from the main group enough to drink (and snack) around the world, but we took it easy and split each drink between three people in all but two areas. I do remember grabbing like five pastries in France and just being way too happy about them. 

I definitely want to do all of those, and ToT (DL just lost theirs, I never got to ride it again and it is TRAGIC) and other stuff. Still have some looking around to do I guess.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Good, low cal breakfast for someone who doesn't have time to cook in the mornings/good to reheat? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I will admit, I am very new to being a full time vegan so I am just getting the hang of things. I made a potato okra hash that was DELICIOUS straight out of the oven, but is very very sad now that I've reheated it. I am super lazy in the mornings and sometimes roll out of bed twenty minutes before I have to leave for work, which means I have about enough time to microwave leftovers and put them in a container and eat them in my car. 

I tend to eat bigger lunches and dinners, so I'm hoping to find something around 200 cal that isn't as awful as these friggin potatoes. Ugh. Not a big fan of oatmeal or any of its grainy cousins in the morning. I avoid fake processed "meats" (looking at you, tempeh bacon) and try to keep my wheat and fat consumption down as much as possible. 

Any input is greatly appreciated! Thaaaanks! 


Edit: thanks, everybody! I'm going to try a few of these out this week :)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Totall agree that he's being gun shy post-divorce, and he has every reason to be. He thought that was going to be it for him, he clearly put a lot of time and effort and love into that relationship, and he was crushed. My ex had an exgf that did something similar to what your guy's ex did. He moved her into a nice apartment, bought all their furniture, helped pay for everything while she wasn't working, did EVERYTHING he could for this woman, and they weren't even married. Three years in she decides she's bored, cheats on him, THEN leaves him. He was messed up about that for years, too messed up for us to ever work out. 

Your guy sounds like he does see a future with you, but is hesitant to make plans. You obviously understand why. And while I don't think it's a good idea to pester him about moving in and talking about the possibilities, it's probably also not a good idea to just wait for him to come to you. If you leave it up to him, he may NEVER come to you about this. It may take MORE effort later if you leave it alone. 

So go about it like this: instead of coming at him with "why won't you move in with me?", let him know that his hesitance to move in with you is a little worrisome, and that you'd like to at least have a frank discussion about what he sees happening in the next five years. Does he want to get married? Probably! He might not be ready for a while, but if you're willing to wait several years, let him know that. Or let him know that you'd maybe want to get married in 20xx and see if he might want to move that. Reassure him that you're in this for the long run, but that his complete avoidance of certain topics is scaring you. You just want to make sure you're both on the same page so that neither of you is left wondering. 

And it's a good conversation to have anyway, especially if he is dodging near-future topics. Do either of you want kids? Is buying a house together something you'd eventually do? Having that knowledge, even if he isn't ready to get married yet, you guys could start putting aside money for a house or a wedding for whenever that may be. It also is a little bit of a reminder for BOTH of you that the other person is still emotionally (and then also, financially) invested in this relationship in the long term.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, this sounds bonkers. Everyone else is wearing different designers and styles, but you can't change yours? It's obviously not like she's looking for identical dresses. 

I agree with another poster - let her know what your budget is for the dress, and tell her that if you were to pay for the dress + structural alterations, it could be well over your budget. Maybe come at her with styles that are similar to the ones she suggested. 

And let her know that if she can't tell you what she does or doesn't want, you're not going to be able to buy a dress in time at all. 

I may sound insensitive here, but is the bride being like this with the other bridesmaids? Is there some kind of difference in conventional attractiveness that could be making her say No for one reason or another? I ask because I had a friend get married who was being really weird with two of her bridesmaids because she thought the dresses were unflattering on their fuller figures. And I have seen plenty of stories of brides just being weird about bridesmaid dresses because they want to be the center of attention (as they should be, it's their wedding!) and are worried about anyone else wearing something that might outshine them.) 

This is why I'm letting my bridal party pick their own dresses. But my wedding is fairly casual and up a mountain, so my guidelines were "anything in this color range, I don't care what else, long or short, sleeves or straps or not, whatever, be comfortable."  </TEXT>

But I like it even more if I think she didn't know who her real mother was while all this went down. Like she thought she was being so clever, exacting some harsh revenge, thought she had the perfect plan, and then gets blindsided by the fact that Mary was her real mother.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Just booked the second leg of our Honeymoon - September 16-23 at Port Orleans, Riverside. But I have almost NO IDEA how WDW works. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-13 03:48:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi! We've been talking about this honeymoon for ages and finally booked it. We're from Los Angeles suburbs and have both had Disneyland APs for several years. I could navigate DL blindfolded. We both also worked at DL in some capacity at some point. Point being, we reeeeeally know DL but have no idea about WDW. FH went once as a kid, and a few years ago we went for a few days with family. But that was a nightmare - we got stuck with the toddler group for the entire week and most days the whole group left at 3PM. I also had more serious health issues then so I was in an ECV the whole time except for part of one day. 

Trip goes like this: we get married 9/9, we have a brunch the next morning to say goodbye to our guests. We drive the two hours home, pick up our luggage, relax a few hours, then head to LAX. From there we fly to Miami for a 5 day cruise to Grand Cayman and Ocho Rios. I would have gone all Disney, but FH wanted a liiiiittle bit of beach time. (Can't blame him). We get off the cruise, have an early lunch in Miami, and we'll rent a car and drive up to WDW. Should get us there right around check in time. 

We'll be at POR for those 7 nights. We are probably upgrading our DL APs to the Premier pass instead of buying tickets - both of our passes expire a month or two after our honeymoon, so the upgrade charge is less than the ticket cost. This is what we did last time and it was great because we also got AP discounts. 

Now. Here's where we're stuck. I've read quite a few "first timer" blogs and lists but still have many, many questions. It seems like so much information is old or conflicting and I can't figure this out. WDW is something like 43 square miles, DL is less than 1! I only have a Disneyland's worth of knowledge and need help from the pros. 

1. How do you decide which days to go to which parks? Preference? Or does it have something to do with ADRs? I have seen some impressive spreadsheets on here. Which brings me to... 

2. How do ADRs work? Can I do them through the app? I read somewhere that staying on property gives you 6 months plus ten days - does that mean ten days before six months, or the ability to book the (up to) ten days of your vacation after your first day? 

3. Which restaurants should we book first? Do reservations open at midnight or some time in the morning? I want to be there first thing to make sure we get what we want. We were super unprepared last time and didn't even know which counter service places to go to. 

4. Magic Bands - I see they're complimentary with resort hotels. How does it work for having a premier pass? Is there a way to add it online? 

5. I've seen all the romantic tips and stuff that people post - nice dinners, walk around POFQ or POR, fireworks from California Grill. But we're also people who like to just stop and people watch, or check out a really insanely tasty snack. What are some good places for relaxing a bit, in parks or out? What food item would you say we absolutely HAVE to have while we're there? What other little/less popular things are really cool that many people miss out on? 

6. I vaguely remember using Fastpass+ when we were there and getting lucky enough to snag some good ones. I've read you can get these 60 days ahead while staying onsite. Which rides do we most need these for? We'd like to have a good amount of structure, we're both the kind of person to say "I don't know, what do YOU want to do?" for half an hour. Which inevitably loses us valuable time. 

7. I've seen some people say that you can do both HS and AK in one day. Does that work well? I planned on a day each but if I remember correctly, last of fastpasses and long lines on these days was the only way we were even able to fill a significant portion of time at either of these. I remember thinking AK was kind of cool, but we can see most of that stuff at the big zoos around here. I would like to open up another day for DS or just relaxing or maybe doing another half day at Epcot, if possible. 

I will probably have more questions later, but I think that'll do for now. I'm so freakin' excited. 

Oh one more thing! I saw a picture of a girl with decals on her magic band, searched Etsy, and WOW there are a lot of them on there. How well do the decals stick? I would like to maybe get a cute monogram one with my new last initial, or something wedding related. Does anyone have someone they go through that makes really good ones?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I joined a group on Facebook that has their inventory up 24/7, but does different hosts and things every few days. I'll be honest, I almost never look at this group. It's just too big and there are too many people. 

Now, I'm not sure what the deal is with the last few days. The pictures have been uploaded by someone other than the consultant whose name is on the page. Not a big deal, I'm guessing. But they are also saying that if you buy a pair of their leggings, you MUST buy a second piece that can't also be leggings. There is no way to buy individual leggings on this group. Is this against the rules? I feel like it should be. Requiring a full other item just to get a cute pair of leggings seems like the consultant is asking too much.  </TEXT>

Confused, mama asked him what scar he meant. The kid was like "when he put it inside you. By your privates. They had to cut you open and put it in your tummy, right? Does daddy still have his penis? Does it hurt? Will mine fall off some day too? How do daddies make more babies after their penis is already gone?" I love children.  </TEXT>

He drove home the dependable car with his son and stuck me and his daughter in the car that kept having troubles with overheating and randomly shutting down! And guess what happened? The freaking car got super hot and shut down in the middle of a busy freeway. Luckily it coasted far enough that I was able to get us to the shoulder, and it was double lucky that we were in an area that has a shoulder at all, because there was a bunch of construction. And instead of coming back for us, DB went all the way back to his house, dropped off the son, and THEN called a tow truck and came to get us. 

They were normally pretty nice but they had a lot of weird issues like this where they did something totally strange. This was like three days into working for them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> FH's family suffered a loss last week. They're all still reeling so talking to them about this right now is out of the question. 

My own family CONSTANTLY has some sort of drama, usually petty, but this time around both my mother and grandmother had to get a hysterectomy because they each, separately, had uterine growths. My mom's weren't cancerous, thank god, but my grandmothers were. She already beat breast cancer! She's tough, but she doesn't need this shit! Luckily they caught it early enough that the hysterectomy should have removed it all. 

My dad, who previously offered to pay for my wedding dress and whose wife and stepdaughters were super gung-ho about wedding planning a year and a half ago, don't even bother answering a phone call or text from my sister or myself. They're off in their own little bubble, whatever. 

My sister was kinda excited/happy for us and I'll get to talk to her, but still! I wanted to be able to be happy about this. Instead I'm doing it because the booking window is closing and now I can't even talk to people about it. 

We're flying out the day after our wedding, landing in Miami, staying there for a night. Then we're heading on a weekish long cruise to Jamaica and Grand Cayman, and then heading back to Miami for part of a day. Then we're renting a nice car, driving up to Orlando, and going to Disney World for eight days! I have only been once when FH's family all went a few years ago, but we got stuck with the little kids most of the trip and didn't get to explore. We go to Disneyland a ton because we have passes but it's soooooo different. 

I'm just excited, damn it! And to top it off, today marked exactly six months until our wedding! Ah!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Unusual ideas for people in the bridal party? or: Lack of Bridesmaids (and two cancellations!) Makes a Bride Feel Lonely. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-10 02:17:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I originally planned on a big bridal party. Before we got engaged, I was much closer with my dad and stepsisters (we now see each other maybe twice a year, tops?), and wasn't aware that my other stepsister would be in college across the country or that our parents would split so it would make her uncomfortable just to be there. I luckily also asked my bio sister, my guy friend, and my girl friend. My FSIL is going to be on FH's side because they've always been super close and I love that! 

I don't have a ton of friends, period. FH and I are pretty solitary people, the quintessential picture of a couple that burrows so deeply into coupledom that they forget about the outside world for weeks at a time. It's super gross and normally I love that companionship, but in planning my wedding I realized how long it has been since I've made a new friend. The friend group I was with before I met FH, I had a falling out with because one of them was a dirtbag and the others were super immature about it and I didn't want to be friends with them anymore. Crappy situation, but whatever. Early in our relationship I was friends with FH's friend group, but that whole group sort of imploded for unrelated reasons and then later, a handful of them did something pretty hurtful out of nowhere to FH, who is literally the coolest most neutral and helpful person ever. 

It sucks. We used to have pretty big groups of friends but they kind of just all disappeared and we've been okay with that up to now because we're not super social anyway and I get anxious with people. In general. 

Anyway, my initial group was mostly sisters but amounted to the six mentioned above and then another really old friend that I've completely lost touch with in the last year. I'm down from 7 to 3. FH has had 5 from the very beginning, because while it was less than mine, it wasn't too much smaller and he didn't care either way. It didn't bother me for a while, but it's starting to. I literally went through all the contacts in my phone and all the friends I have on Facebook (not many, but enough that I should have been able to figure this out) and couldn't think of any girl friends to ask. I already have my best guy friend, a dude I've known since I was 5 who is basically my brother. 

I'm stumped. At this point, I'm not 100% sure I want to ask more people, but I do feel like I would be upset with having such a small group when the day comes and when all the other events happen. I would like to at least consider other options. 

What "unusual" bridesmaids do you guys have or have you heard of? Other family members? My family is pretty small but his family is huge, but I don't know if I'm close enough with any of them. Mostly Facebook friends. I literally thought about asking my grandma, who I've always been very close with. She'd probably not want to do it though, she's had some health issues lately and usually uses a walker and doesn't much like being the center of attention. 

I. Am. Stumped. And I am feeling lonely. Help.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would suggest using that last page as a cover sheet that uses the right formulas to compile info. We use something like this for budgeting right now - each tab has a different section of our budget with transactions and totals, our cover sheet has the latest totals in each account and shows projected and past totals based on date ranges. So, we know that the first week of the month, our monthly spending is dramatically different than the fourth because of rent, but the third is a close second because we pay off a few things that week. 

So for example, you could keep your tabs similar to how they are now, for detailed product reference, but compile the data on those sheets onto the last page as a cover. Add a similar table beneath it for skin concerns. How are your eyes felling? Irritated? Skin feeling oily? It'll all be right there. 

Goes like this: you have your database already here. Awesome. 

Each week, you take note of which products you're using and how your skin feels/looks, in two separate tables.  Easy. So each week you fill a different row across however many columns/categories you have in each tab, like you have. 

Next week, same thing. And again. Oh, you notice your skin has felt irritated all three of the last three weeks. Cover sheet/log says that in the last three weeks, you've used two overlapping products say, a moisturizer and a mask. Note on each product listing in the detailed reference that x and y product could be causing irritation. Next week, take one away and continue to use one. Skin still irritated? Drop the other one. You'll probably be able to figure it out pretty quickly when you have a sheet that's got all the information summarized for you. 

If you want to take it a step further, each week that you use products, take note of which ones have ingredients that others are sensitive to. Certain natural oils, scents, gritty exfoliants, gel type vs lotion type moisturizers, fragrances, etc. 

You will probably realize "hey, this and this primer both made my skin weird. They're both silicone based. Maybe drop the silicone and see if that helps!" but it can take a few months of diligent logging and comparisons. I used the silicone primers as an example because I tried every cult favorite primer on the planet before realizing that silicone primers made me feel super gross halfway through the day. And fragrances in skincare make my skin sad. 

I am admittedly terrible with remembering how to technically design spreadsheets (I can plan it out but as far as remembering formulas, I can barely remember how to do totals some days) but I have been actually working on one with my fianc for a couple of weeks, just never got around to finishing it. Now I need to go figure out how to best grab similar info from ingredient lists. Hmmmm.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hah, your mom sounds like my mom. She keeps insisting that she's surprised I'm "not turning into a total bridezilla", which, first of all I HATE that term, and second the only -zilla of anything around here is her, the momzilla. She cries at everything and guilts everyone around her into a bunch of bullshit and has literally blamed me for most of her problems since my birth. Textbook narcissist. Moving out helped our relationship some, but not much. 

Basically, we're tossing tradition too. Both my parents and my FH's parents are divorced and remarried, so we have four sets of parents to contend with. Everyone and their mother wanted to pay for my dress, but if I went with that I'd have $25k in dress and $5 in wedding, so no way. We said "contributions are welcome but not expected, we're not taking directed payments because there are too many people offering to take care of one or two things and nobody wants to pay for the important things like, you know, a venue. We'd be happy to include you in planning and celebrating regardless of if you contribute or not." We expected backlash but that mostly went well (until everyone wanted to go to catering tastings, which got me to the point of saying "FH and I will be the only ones going to tastings so that nobody thinks we're playing favorites!") 

My stepmom is also kind of an abrasive person though, and while my FMIL is organized, she and I do not see eye to eye on ideas for wedding and events. FSMIL is the kind of lady to write a check, tell us to have fun, and ask us to make sure she's got some champagne, so she's my favorite right now. We have gotten to the point where everyone has a specific list of things they can help with. In the nicest of terms, these things are suited to everyone's unique strengths. In the plainest terms, my mom's and MIL's responsibilities amount to "important" busy work like talking to out of town Family about travel, helping pick stuff for the dessert bar, and helping pick centerpieces. Shit I know will happen whether or not they put real effort into it, stuff that can't really possibly get messed up. 

That ended up more of a rant than I was planning on but whatever. 

Make your people a list. When it comes to pre-wedding event, it would be totally acceptable to have them "co-host", have a "planning dinner" with them both, and then tell them you'll email what you need them to do, or find reasons it would be easier for stepmom to do these things instead of mom. For me, a lot of our "reasons" are "I'm actually headed over there for an errand today!" Or "her friend can get us a discount!" If they have tasks, they feel useful. I have taken my mom shopping for decor stuff like ten times. I rattle on about details and pretty things to pacify her for a while, I pick out some lanterns or some shit I was going to get anyway, she cries about being excited and how she wants to be involved more, I tell her she's getting more time than anyone else (sort of true since FH and I are doing everything ourselves lol) and that I will let her know when we've made a decision about something. She's already shown me like fifty MotB dresses she loves and I'm just like "wow! So beautiful!!!!!!1!!!11!" And she is happy again. 

Little white lies won't kill anyone and they'll save you a huge headache. My mom is currently in charge of asking her friend if we can borrow dessert table stuff. She has taken over a month to do this. I am preparing to buy or rent stuff if she doesn't get it done soon, so whatever.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Couples therapy, man. But I'd suggest looking into a MFT that specifically helps with families and abuse as well as communications issues. Ours wasn't and it was difficult for us to find a plan that really worked. We mainly fixed our communication issues there and then worked on handling our parental issues (my mom is the kind of person who can occasionally be awesome but for most of my childhood was the type of person that should have had CPS called on her, FH used to be a hardcore momma's boy who would always take her advice/choices over anyone else's until he realized that he was being super weird), which was helpful in the long run but maybe not the best way to handle it. 

Sounds like he honestly wants to try, and sounds like he had my kinda younger years. My parents were at times awesome, fun people, and I remember those days fondly while also remembering that they were pretty shitty a lot of the time too. It makes it really hard to have that kind of childhood because you desperately want to defend family members that gave you good memories. Took me a really long time to come to terms with what my relationship with my parents really was - I didn't really admit it was abuse until last year, and I'm 26, even though I was openly able to talk about the worst days of my childhood with people. sounds like your guy is maybe not at that point yet. It's not an easy point to get to. If he wants to work on it, he does. I love my mom, but there's no way in hell im leaving my kids at her house overnight after the emotional abuse she threw at me for so long. 

I'd maybe sit down with him and say "I understand your relationship with your family is complicated, but as someone who wants to be a mother, I cannot in good faith have children with you and then leave them alone in the care of people who YOU have told me did x, y, and z when you were a kid. If you heard that a nanny or daycare worker yelled/threatened your kid, or smacked a kid, you'd say they were not capable of caring for your kid, right? You'd fire them and not leave your kid in their care. Same goes for family. I am not rejecting your good memories of your childhood! There were probably plenty of happy memories. but I am looking out for our future offspring so that they don't have to have the NEGATIVE experiences you did." 

My FH got to a point where he understood that I would not be leaving our kids in the care of any of our four sets of parents. But it took him a while to get there. I wouldn't have agreed to marry him without his agreement on that. It's why so many people say you need to have that real, in depth conversation about child rearing and child care. Sometimes people think "we're both good people! Our kids will be fine!" And then they have totally different ideas. 

I hope everything goes well for you. I don't doubt that you'll stand your ground, which is a badass Step One already!

<TEXT> FH and I have been together six years, we've always known we'd get married and I always knew I'd plan most of it myself. Not because I had to, but because our parents are both divorced and remarried, so we have four sets of parents and a zillion other family members to contend with. It's just easier if we dole out small tasks and handle the bulk of it ourselves. We knew we'd have plenty of help from people when the time came that we needed help, so we didn't want to hire a professional planner or anything. We just figured we'd hammer our the details ourselves first and then welcome help as soon as we needed it. 

But jeez, people, come on! 

My mom has been super gung-ho about wedding planning since before FH popped the question. She's a Pinterest junkie and has literally had a board for her kids weddings since before FH and I got together. She's got so many IDEAS but refuses to believe that anyone else's ideas are worth anything because they're not this pinterest perfect blush and sage wedding she's been obsessing over for years. Not that I really give a crap what she thinks about my wedding, because I'm a grown woman and she and I have had a rocky relationship since my birth, but it takes a toll when every. Single. Thing. Is "well wouldn't it be nicer if you did x, y, or z thing I showed you?" No. It would not. She also has a good friend at work that is an awesome event planner. She does these things for fun and puts together flowers, dessert tables, all kinds of stuff. Early on in planning my mom said the friend offered herself up for planning help, grabbing fresh flowers day of and helping set them up (my wedding is up a mountain, so vendor organization is a bane) which I was super happy to hear, but now my mom is being a pain in the ass and won't give me the girl's contact info. She insists on doing all of the communication herself. But she doesn't have time to hear details, so now I'm six months out from my wedding, all the local florists are booked up, and I am this close to telling my mother that if she doesn't give me this girls contact info, she's going to have to be the one who pays for my flowers since I can't find a friggin florist. 

My dad and stepmom were also super excited about planning and promised to help pay for a bunch of stuff. Then my dad very suddenly got "laid off" (for the third time in three years, which, let's face it, he's getting fired because he's addicted to painkillers and he's an idiot) so they can't help financially. Fine. We have more than enough money at this point. But they still seemed interested in helping until they just stopped answering my phone calls. They're lucky they're even getting invited to the wedding at this point, because I see them maybe once a year even though they live like an hour and a half away. He's moved on with his new family, I get it, but once again I fell for promises that nobody could keep. Also, we used to be closer with them so I had always planned on having my stepsisters as bridesmaids, but I'm pretty sure my dad has been telling them that I have been ignoring HIM, instead of the other way around, so they pretty much don't like me now no matter what I do, so I'm down two bridesmaids. 

My FH's family has been on and off helpful, but they've recently been rocked by a devastating loss in the family so I am not going to take up any more of their time than absolutely necessary. This is something that made us consider postponing our wedding entirely, we're just barely in the midst of it, but I'm not going to bother them with wedding stuff for a while. I know they'll want to help in their own time and their own ways, but I am giving them as much space as I can for now. (I haven't brought up postponing to any family members that are close to it, but some on the fringe have said that we shouldn't, the family will need something happy and six months is enough time to process things and be able to have something happy happen later on.) 

My sister is supposed to be my MOH but she's literally the least helpful person. She's combative and she's got an attitude on her. I've always known this, but she seemed like she really wanted to help at first, so I asked her to be MOH and now she's basically always busy or wants to talk about something else. She's supposed to be planning my bridal shower and bachelorette and not only can I not get her to help me plan, I can't even get time to see her to bring it up. She's super keen on planning what dress she's going to wear and where she's going to stay and what fun stuff is going on, but she can't be bothered to actually be responsible. I made sure to ask her, "are you sure you can handle this?" And she was all promises. She's got a good job but she doesn't work long hours, so she can certainly afford to help with these things and she has plenty of time, but she's holed up with her new boyfriend that she very suddenly moved in with and everyone else is just out on the line. 

My other stepsister, who was supposed to be one of my bridesmaids, found out that she's going to be going to her dream school next September. Across the country. And her dad's relationship with my mom is sort of on the rocks, so I'm definitely not going to make her fly back and miss her first weekend at college for a wedding that might make her uncomfortable. 

I don't have a lot of friends and even fewer of those friends have gotten married, so I'm kind of lost. 

FH has, luckily, been my rock. This just further reaffirms why I'm marrying this man. Even in the face of his own tragedy, he's been supportive and loving and as helpful as he can be. He's always been pretty involved in wedding planning but now he's pretty much the only one giving me motivation to keep going. We'd elope, but we already have so many deposits in and we are really actually excited to have this wedding and get everyone together. I suffer from intense bouts of depression, and this whole loss thing just has me at a really low point. 

We visited our venue last weekend though, and it was so beautiful and really tried to kickstart the rest of our planning. FH says we should just bunker down for a week or two and plan the entire rest of our wedding, and I'm not against the idea, as long as he brings vodka.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alright, I connected my ipad keyboard so I could type this shit out because it would take too long to peck out manually. Sounds like you're in roughly the same situation as me. I have one bio sister, three step sisters, one sister in law, two best friends, and not enough vodka. Mine sort of weeded themselves out by a combination of location (one step sis going off to college, I am not making her miss her first weekend there) and other crap (my other two stepsisters I see maybe twice a year, we're not close and they're kind of flaky, my FSIL will be FH's best 'man' because they've always been super close) so I'm down to three. FH has 5 because he thought I'd have 7, so now I'm super short on people but whatever, I'll have my most important people with me. 

Yours sounds harder to figure out, but just from what I can see from your comment, I'd suggest this: 

1. Little sister: MOH doesn't have to reeeeally be anything but a title. Like MY little sister, I don't expect her to actually plan the whole thing herself, even though she's technically my MOH. Can you maybe ask a parent or another bridesmaid to help her with planning and organizing? Especially since she'll be out of town for some of it and probably busy. That's what I'm doing with mine. I love her dearly but she's an airhead and she's 22 and can barely remember what day it is sometimes, so she's getting an "assistant" in the form of our mother. She might not be in town every day while you're planning, but she'll probably be eager to help when she IS there. 

2. Baby sister: would be an awesome JB. Take her dress shopping, find her a cute JB dress, have her get ready with you and the girls, maybe take her to lunch with a few of the other bridesmaids and let her help out if you're having a bridal shower. Age-appropriate jobs can make a JB feel helpful and included if they can't do standard stuff like Bachelorette parties or stuff like that. 

3. Big sister: This one's tough. I would say ask her if you want to, but make sure she knows upfront what will be expected of her, financially and otherwise. Get together with her or call her and say you'd love for her to be a bridesmaid if she wants to make that happen, but that you'd totally understand if she can't swing it. Let her know that you're planning on a dress within $x-$y range, that you're hoping to do x, y, or z for a bachelorette party (like, what do you have in mind? a one-night party, or is she going to have to shell out for a weekend away?) and that the wedding will be in x location (will she need a hotel, or is there family she could stay with? Any other wedding weekend events in the mix?). Then, with all of that information presented, let her know that you'd love for her to say yes, but that if she doesn't think she'll be able to swing it, you'd still love it if she could get ready with you and maybe make it to the bridal shower or bachelorette if she wants. You also have to consider this: if you ask her and she says she can commit to those things, but then later down the line she suddenly can't afford the dress, can you afford to help her out? If that's something you're willing to help out with or risk in order to have her with you, then ask her. (I have some money set aside to help my little sister with stuff since I know she committed to being my MOH, but she will inevitably need some assistance with it.)

4. Older sister: I wouldn't ask her. You just listed several reasons I wouldn't want to invite someone to be my own bridesmaid. Sounds like more trouble than it's worth. And it's not really your fault FH is asking your brother. She can still get ready with you without having to be in the bridal party. 

5. College bestie 1: Ask her to be a bridesmaid, with the additional note that while your little sister is your MOH, she's going to need plenty of help in that department and you'd love it if she could help plan and organize, since she's just as important to you! You COULD also ask them both to be co-MOH, which I've seen done successfully! My old friend just got married and had two MOHs, and they split responsibilities and helped each other out a ton. Like your little sister, she might not be in town all the time, but she'll probably be very excited to help out when she can.

6. College bestie 2: I would say have a conversation with her about it. If she really might not be able to be there at all, it might not be worth it. But if there's a chance she'd fly back, or a chance she would be in town at that time, she could do it. Be honest with her about it, that you'd love to ask her but that it would be painful to ask her and then have her not be able to be there at all. 

7. High school bestie: Ask her! With so many others in the bridal party missing for huge chunks of time, it'll be nice to have a good friend who will be in town and physically there for a lot of it. 

8. Study abroad friend: I'd skip. It would be a nightmare organizing dresses and events. NZ is pretty far (obviously) and not like someone who lives a few hours away and can make it down for a weekend. She'd probably only be there for the wedding itself and that's not really the point of a bridal party. She can always get ready with you, etc, but logistically, long-distance bridesmaids are a problem. 

9. Bye, college roommate. Invite her to the wedding, but don't push for someone you aren't as close with anymore. 

tl;dr: Bridal Party: Little sister (MOH), baby sister (JB), big sister (maybe), college bestie 1 (possible co-MOH, definitely helping little sister), college bestie 2 (maybe), high school bestie. With others invited to join in getting ready and pre-wedding events as you and they see fit. If both of your maybes say no, you have 4 but a dedicated 4. If both of them say yes, you've got 6, which is pretty close to even anyway. 

Okay that was a lot of words, but I hope it helps a little haha  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So beautiful! I love the whole thing, top to bottom. 

My center stone is my late grandmothers, it was in a necklace my late grandfather gave her for one of their big anniversaries. It's smaller than most people would electively choose, a little discolored, but I love it. And the coloring sometimes makes it look like a fancy yellow diamond, even though it's not suuuper yellow. I went with a very pretty verragio setting that almost wouldn't accommodate the smaller diamond, but my fianc told the jeweler the deal and they somehow made it work and made it very secure. 

She passed when I was 8 or 9, breast cancer. We were all on vacation when it happened. My grandpa passed about ten years later. They were by no means rich, but he found every way he could to spoil the hell out of her. They loved each other so much, and I'm glad I get to carry a bit of that with me every day. 

Having a reminder like that is a blessing.  </TEXT>

The ones we have so far are black and gold, we're hoping to add larger ones though. We're doing all fake flowers and LED candles, since we can't have open flame at our venue and we'll be up there the whole weekend, so we're doing very minimal real flowers.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Holy crap. Not much advice to be given because I'm approaching the same situation, almost to a T, and I have been wondering the same. FH and I are getting married in a few months and don't want to wait too long for kids. My mom is bipolar and has explosive, manipulative anger problems that meant some shitty mistreatment for most of my life. When FH and I got together I moved in with him super quickly and my relationship with my mother, which I had hoped would get better with us not living under the same roof, basically just got worse. 

I think the only thing I can suggest it this - you may not even have to broach this topic if you set boundaries very very firmly. Something like "mom, while I would eventually like for us to reach the point where we are more comfortable, I do not want you stopping by unannounced anymore. We have a routine at home and your visits often interrupt and make things difficult. If you'd like to schedule times to see kid with us, we can do that. But right now we can't trust you to respect boundaries." 

If she throws a fit, she's not being respectful and you shouldn't feel bad about telling her that she won't be allowed to spend time with your kid until she can fix it. And if it gets to the point where she honestly is trying to respect boundaries, be frank with her. "Remember all those stories you told me? I am not ready to trust you alone with kid because of these. It will take (time/effort/whatever) to make us think about it in the future but I am very protective of kid and for right now, you watching kid alone is off the table." 

If she STILL throws a fit about your MIL watching kid, fuck it. She can't see your kid because she mistreated you and doesn't give a crap about respecting your boundaries as parents. She is cut off until she can grow up.

Gives her a chance to change without risk of leaving her alone with kid. Idk. I am still struggling with how I'm going to tell my mom this stuff, so if you figure it out, let me know. Ugh.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I thought I had problems last week when wedding planning was being a pain in the ass. Hah. Just when I start to get annoyed with petty things in my life, bad things must happen. 

My grandmother beat breast cancer just a few years ago. She's a tough old broad but when she was diagnosed with uterine cancer a few weeks ago, the whole family was worried. Luckily they caught this new stuff fairly early so the hysterectomy should get it all out, but she's 75 and her body is just barely recovering from the breast cancer and the chemo. Lady just can't catch a break. 

My sister-in-law was due to have her baby shower this Saturday. I just bought gifts for her babies, including a beautiful wingback glider chair she wanted and a bunch of clothes. I wrapped the gift at home and within the hour we got a text that she'd gone into early labor, they were trying to stop it. Twenty minutes later we get the text that she's going in for an emergency c-section. She's 24 weeks along, which is JUST on the right side of viable, but neither of the babies seemed to be in any kind of distress, SILs body just didn't want to be pregnant anymore. They both came out crying, which is great news because it means their lungs are working a little on their own. They're both in the NICU and we're just hoping for the best. 

And I can't visit either of them because I'm still fighting off this stupid cold that I've had for like the last fucking MONTH. 

And I'm STILL supposed to just keep planning my wedding like the world isn't crashing down around me. I don't give a shit about tablecloths right now. I just want my family to be okay.

<TEXT> She didn't hear me, and she deserved it. This kid is spoiled, whiny, and a total BRAT. She apparently said some mean things to 8F today and tried to get her excluded from the friend group. 8F is a little sensitive so she came out almost in tears. 

She wouldn't tell me what it was at first, but when she finally told me I was like "Oh, Sophia? She's a turd, just ignore her. You know who your friends are." And 8F cracked up and told me well, she HAD gotten to hang out with some friends she didn't usually talk to, and yeah, Sophia is kind of a turd but she'll be fine. 

I also curse in front of my kiddos (the parents do it occasionally too, it just makes them giggle) and give them extra screen time when I don't want to deal with the drama. 

But the kids love me, the parents love me, and I love them. Oh well!

<TEXT> I mean he's also prone to being a total turd sometimes because he can be a bit robotic but he's a genuinely good dude who has committed to better communication and has shown effort. I am so proud of him. 

The icing on this magical cake is this. I, who have always had problems with my mother, am getting married to aforementioned robot man. We've been together over five years, it's time, we're super chill about the whole thing. I actually surprised myself with how I am not being totally neurotic with this process. (My general feeling is "Wear what you want, show up when you want, yes I am wearing keds, no we are not getting a giant cake, yes there will be bugs, we are getting married in the forest, we can't take everyone to every fitting and I'm not giving in to tantrums, hope you can make it, there's gonna be an open bar!" That said, I am fully aware that the hardest part of wedding planning is everyone ELSE that is involved. 

My mother, namely, is the Chief Crazy Person. My mother and I don't have the best relationship, she's bipolar and never sticks to meds long enough to make a difference. She was not the best mother during my younger years, and I continue to slip back into her persuasive clutches even though she continues to treat me like crap. I'm actively working on making myself more resistant to this kind of shit but I still fail sometimes. It completely stresses me out to the point of tears at least once a month. I have had to take communication breaks and go temp NC just for my mental health. It's gotten better but still hard. 

So where we're getting married, there are cabins onsite. Not a ton, but enough for maybe 30 people. When we went for our venue visit it was just me, FH, my mom, and his mom. His mom paid our deposit even though I asked her not to (she's a whole other problem, ugh) and my mom immediately tried to take over, saying she was going to visit and rent a cabin a few weeks later and that she really wanted this one cabin for the wedding weekend. I was like "ok we'll talk about it later" but since we booked in July she will Not. Give. Up. She constantly says "oh just put me wherever!" But then when I suggest something else (we're trying to save certain spots for family with young kids) she gets all whiny and says how she'd reeeeally like this one instead. She also promised to help my sister (my MOH, the GC, also another problem) plan my bachelorette party and bridal shower. So far she: 

A: hasn't given us the money she promised us 

B: has bitched about the cabin thing 

C: is upset I didn't take her to our catering tasting 

D: threw a fit about dress shopping (I told her to invite my sister, she forgot, she blamed me for my sister being upset even though my sister had already gone with me once and this certainly wasn't the last time) 

E: she keeps making comments about how she's soooo surprised that I'm not being a bridezilla (I hate that term, and also I am not the kinda person to be weird about my wedding. I am normally a pretty chill person, it's just HER that annoys me all the time) and that she expected me to be a control freak and make everyone do things just right. That's all her. 

F: She thinks she's entitled to so much. My dad's kind of a jerk so he's not walking me down the aisle. My next thought was my sister but now I don't want that either. When I discussed this with my mom, her response was that she thought she would get to do it. Even though she has verbally, emotionally, and sometimes physically abused me since I was very young. Uh. No. 

G: She has in the past had jobs that have included putting on events. Some of these events have been big and pretty cool, not gonna lie. But she has very different ideas than we do about this wedding. She basically insisted that she would be our coordinator, and when I told her we were thinking about hiring someone, she got all offended and went "well, I DO plan events for a living," (not really anymore but whatever) "so I don't know why you'd waste your money." Uh, because you're crazy and you scream in my face when you are the least bit stressed and I don't want that on my wedding day? Jeez. 

... and I'm just sure there's more to come. I was stressed out for a while about all this. Basically, FH and I both have parents that divorced and remarried, so we have four sets of parents and my grandmother (who is contributing significantly and is my mother figure and a total badass awesome lady) to contend with. Everyone wants a piece of this wedding and I'm in the middle. I basically told FH the minute we started talking budget that we needed to be clear - contributions do not equal decision-making power. Noooo way. Because warring opinions will not get this thing off to a good start. If someone gives us an idea that sucks or tries to control something, I just clam up and ignore it. Sometimes people (like our mothers!) keep bringing stuff up. I told him I was done. This was OUR wedding. I am not going to compromise and lose something we love because so and so doesn't like it. 

So my man, my big goofy robot man, he smirks and he says "let me contact her then. Seriously. I will tell her I'm in charge of x, y, and z things she's bugging you about, and I'll email her and tell her to bring up any comments she has to me, not you. She what she says about THAT." 

At first I thought he was being facetious, but then he wasn't smiling and he started talking about which things he could take charge of. He said he could take care of lodging because it's mostly his family, and he could take care of putting together a music set up and requests, and he would be totally up for "taking blame" for anything I wanted that my mom was against. Like hiring another coordinator. Heh. 

So last weekend he and I went to visit the venue. It's just as perfect as we remembered. We're so excited! And while we were up there, we booked the wife of the venue owner as our coordinator, since she does that sort of thing. Last minute, FH realized I needed an "out" for my mom taking charge and said "hell yeah, let's do this."  

When we came back and my mom flooded my phone with texts, I told her we hired the lady. She knows the place better than anyone and will also help with the rehearsal dinner the night before. She's cheaper than any coordinator we looked up and she's super on top of it. 

My mom's reply was icy, but... civil. She'll be upset about it in time, I'm sure. She was expecting me to offer her the spot after (under pressure) I told her I would think about it. 

But for now, we've removed her from a spot of power, I'll placate her with other jobs, and my FH has agreed to be the point of contact for everything she wants to bitch about. 

Super glad I'm marrying this man.

<TEXT> 1. A veil and belt would look pretty, but keep them both minimal - how are you thinking of doing your hair? If down, a simple comb veil that could be worn for the ceremony will give you a traditional feel without being too traditionally bridal. As for a belt, with that I would shy away from anything too sparkly. Something beaded in the same color scheme of the dress might look nice. 

I am also considering a fairly non-traditional dress. People are not every good at hiding their... confusion? disappointment? Whatever. It hurt at first and it still kinda stings but at the end of the day, if it makes YOU feel beautiful, and it's going on YOUR body, wear whatever you want! Which leads to my next point: 

2. Next time your MOH says something that negative about your dress/choices that you are obviously excited about, tell her she's being a turd. From me, if you want to pass blame. My sister was purposefully left out of one dress appt because she and my mother team up with their opinions, which are usually the opposite of whatever I say. Turds. The whole lot. Love them, but jeez.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah fuck that. What does your husband have to say about it? Has he talked to his brother? This kind of behavior is batshit. 

If the brothers haven't talked to each other about this, they need to. If your husband isn't backing you up, he needs to. And if he does back you up, he can politely tell his brother that not only will you not be staying elsewhere, but that you're uncomfortable and a bit offended by the fact that the bride wants to completely separate you from everyone else. 

This is not how healthy family relationships start. Wedding or not she's being super disrespectful and she needs to be told NO.  </TEXT>

I don't even understand how people can be this crazy about weddings. We're shelling out a big ass chunk of change but we're not making demands of people. Wtf. The marriage is more important than the wedding.

But I just wanted to check with you - would it be okay with you if I hold your hand or kiss you in front of the group?

<TEXT> Hah, your list sounds like mine. And your categories are basically exactly what we went with. We're having a semi-destination wedding (same county that most of the people we're inviting live in, but up a mountain or two and a bit of a drive for a day visit). 

We split up our list into three initial groups - 

A: those we know for a fact are coming (parents, siblings, wedding party, other very close family)
B: those who we think are probably going to come, at least for the wedding day but probably for the weekend (fringe family, old friends) 
C: those who probably won't be there but at least needed an invitation (far away family we haven't seen in a while, busy family friends, people we haven't seen in a while but used to really care about) 

Each of those is in a column. Would the whole family come? All four in A. Are maybe the parents of this family going to come, but their kids won't be there? Two in B, two in C. That kind of thing. That way we could more accurately guess at a guest count when we had early meetings with vendors. 

From there, we had additional columns. 

- adults versus children under 12, which is a standard sort of age cut offs for vendors like catering who might have a separate charge or menu for kids. 

- What days we expected them to be there. Our parents and close family will come up with us on Thursday. We're having a welcome BBQ combined with our rehearsal on Friday. Saturday is the actual wedding. Sunday we're having a farewell breakfast before everyone heads out. Who do we expect to come for the long weekend and help us set up? Who will make a weekend out of it and come for Friday and Sunday? Who is local and might just come for the day? We did our best to set this up just for our own estimates re: rehearsal BBQ and farewell breakfast, but they won't be accurate until we start getting RSVPs, and they don't need to be anyway since we'll just be making a costco run the day we drive up. 

I can send you a picture of how we did our spreadsheets, if you're interested. FH is a data organization dork who counts Excel and Google Sheets as two of his favorite things on earth, so a well-organized wedding was a no-brainer. 

Edit: Forgot to mention - since your wedding will be far for these people, it would be really difficult to expect them to not come with their kids. If you say "No Kids", expect that a significant portion of your guests with kids won't be able to attend at all because of it. However there's also the option of hiring a babysitter/care of some kind for the duration of the wedding. If there's space at your venue, hire a babysitter. I had a friend have her wedding at a nice hotel. She hired two babysitters to watch the kids under 10 in one of the hotel rooms so that the parents didn't have to stress about finding babysitters in an unfamiliar town. The parents loved it because they weren't far from their kids, the babysitters were good about contacting the parents with updates, etc, but the parents got to relax and there were no toddlers underfoot at the fancy wedding. The kids watched movies, had snacks, and got to stay up a little late and have their own little party with their cousins and stuff, so it was fine by them.

<TEXT> It's like you're me! I could barely be bothered to wear moisturizer most days before I started thinking about the wedding. I've always had a bit of acne and rough skin so I figured that now, at 25/26, I should do something about it. Changed up my routine first. Awesome. Skin cleared up mostly. Then went to get a facial one day, just to try it out. Now I'm getting them monthly. My skin looks amaaaaazzing, best it has since I was a child basically. I am growing out my natural hair for the first time ever (I used to bleach it, dye it, cut it in weird ways, the whole deal) and now it's like 100% my natural color and long and I found out it's curly! Taking care of myself is weird! 

I'd say if you're interested in the back facial, try one out now and see if you like it. I have been experimenting with different facials and stuff and finding out what works. 

My biggest tip would be to stick with the same person. If you love the person who did your facial last time, stick with them. They'll help you figure out what works best with your skin. I know too many people who bounce around between aestheticians because they think THAT's what's going to help things, but most technicians have the same tools. Sticking with one person allows them to keep notes on your skin, what works and what doesn't, and lets YOU become more comfortable with telling them what didn't work so well. Example: I have been seeing a lovely lady named Holly for my facials for about six months. I LOVED my first two, but my third was a little underwhelming. The extractions weren't as thorough, I didn't like the moisturizer she used afterwards, and my skin didn't have that GLOW. She totally took note of my concerns and my facials since then have been amazing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you! And I can! 

Basically the key to using flowers next to lights is LEDs - you MUST use an LED bulb or the lights just get too hot and can be a fire hazard. These are the GE Reveal LED bulbs - a great color temperature for applying makeup, dimmable, the whole deal. I'd suggest using four instead of six. If you do use six like I did, you have to have a dimmer or it's waaaay too bright. Found that out the hard way. My eyes. Ouch. 

The electrical stuff is not my area of expertise, my guy did that and it looks a little patched together and I'm not sure that's the right way to do things... but basically we built a larger frame around an IKEA mirror with some cheap boards from Home Depot, and we drilled holes through the frame to put the flowers through so they'd be straight instead of having to bend or glue them, which would make them crooked since so many fake flowers have big plastic bases. I just bent the leftover stems flat back against the frame. That also means they're replaceable! So I can change it up if I want to. 

As for the vanity, it's basically just an IKEA laptop table with the original small shelf taken out and a big piece of shelving from Home Depot in its place, with brackets to secure. I put the dimmer switch for the mirror on the side of the vanity so I can easily reach it.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Amazing TJ Maxx find - Valentino cardigan for $60! </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [THIS](https://imgur.com/a/8ClQP) is the cardigan in question - excuse my weird dressing room picture. 

I was looking for a black cardigan anyway, have been for ages, and in sifting through the racks I saw the Valentino tag. I mean I've never seen one before in my life until today but I recognized the name immediately. I thought I was seeing things, but the price tag doesn't lie either. It's not something I would ever ever consider buying at full price, but a good quality cardigan in a nice cut is totally worth $60 for me, since I have a short torso and short arms and most of them make me look weird. 

I can't find this exact style online anymore but I saw similar cardigans listed at $600-$1000, TJ Maxx tag says $800! (Those things are sometimes off but this price seems to be right on based on what's currently and recently available!) If it were actually $800, I got it for just 7.5% of it's original retail value! 

Probably the best TJ Maxx deal I'll ever find, ever. I will probably be the only one that knows it's Valentino but oh well, I'll feel fancy. Werk.  </TEXT>

My fianc and I built me a custom glass topped/see through vanity a few years ago. The mirror was always a crappy little warped plastic frame from Walmart (not pictured) so I wanted to upgrade. Grabbed a big square mirror at IKEA with the goal of building custom lighting and possibly putting flowers around it. 

Great success! 

[Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/Et5ay) is a better/softer picture so you can see bulb placement and the flowers better. 

I haven't officially sat down to use it yet, as I don't wear makeup to work, but I'll use it Saturday and Sunday! I am officially considering my vanity setup complete. (Yeah, right.)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Having been in her position before because of a mess of depression and body image issues, she reeeeeally needs to get help for this. Specific, separate help with a therapist that has experience with sexual issues. I didn't get help and for several months the thought of having sex with my fianc was bizarre. I'd begrudgingly do it and do whatever I could to make it end soon, even when it felt good, because I was so anxious. He constantly tried to reassure me, is as attracted to me as you are to your girl, but it is hard hearing it from your partner because OF COURSE they love you and want you. 

Individual and/or couple's therapy can be so so helpful. I also started eating healthier and working out a bit (partially to lose weight and partially just to feel better about my body) and my endorphins are through the roof. 

See if you can't be intimate with her in other ways in the mean time. Massage, making out, lots of cuddling. It helps when she can be very comfortable and when you're patient. That's all I got for ya.  </TEXT>

He got on a plane this morning for a weeklong business trip after less than 24 hours notice. My massive anxiety is driving me insane because he hasn't landed yet. I went and blew the normal amount of our entire weekly grocery bill on five meals for some of the time that he's gone. And got a box of wine. (But like, the *classy* box.) I haven't been single for Valentine's Day since... high school? So this is weird for me. I am a dork about these holiday things, too, so I'm a sad panda. 

So I just made a massive ribeye for myself, am steadily working through the wine, and just opened a bag of those chocolate Dove hearts with the messages. Comfort food.

<TEXT> My engagement was similar. I knew it was coming, down to what night. partially because we had a dating anniversary trip scheduled anyway, to the place I wanted to get engaged. That part was a coincidence actually, but the planning? Nah. We went together to pick out the ring, we had talked about marriage a TON, we knew we were ready. We'd been talking about marriage for years. Since very early on in our relationship. We knew when it would happen and people thought it was lacking romance. My fianc proposed in front of the castle at Disneyland, after fireworks and an amazing meal, on our four year dating anniversary, with a sweet hotel room, and a ring I loved, which included my heirloom diamond from my grandmother. How is that lacking romance? 

Good communication is romantic in its own way. Being mutually ready for engagement and marriage is better than any surprise proposal. Planning for the future is romantic as fuck. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  </TEXT>

I mean I'm not 110% SAVED and I'm not not-depressed but there's an inkling of an idea that life might be worth living.

<TEXT> It's not really about sides. Honestly, if I were in your position, the husband would be in the friggin doghouse ten times over. He turned his entire family against you, knowing they'd feel that way, because HE went against your very genuine concern without even asking. UGH. This makes me mad just thinking about it. 

It's this simple - is he okay with the possibility that she has a psychotic episode around your child and possibly harms him, intentionally or not? I would think that's not okay with him. And hurting his sisters feelings - when she clearly knows at this point that she's different - is a hell of a lot less important than the potential DEATH of your kid. 

Overall, this is your kid and you have the right to make decisions about who you trust to care for it. Don't trust her? That word is final. He has no room for debate. He's endangering your child. 

If you'd like to be conscious of his feelings, just remind him of how he'd feel if she had an episode and harmed him. If you want to really make him realize how bad this is, let him know that it was completely unreasonable for him to involve his family in decisions about YOUR child, and that if he continues to be dishonest and endanger your child this way, your kid isn't going to be able to see them at all. 

This is so scary. I had a friend in high school whose father developed a sort of mental illness after a traumatic brain injury. Someone she'd felt completely safe with for 16 years attacked her when he had an episode and broke sixteen of her bones, left her with internal bleeding. She needed stitches in four places. She's lucky she lived. You NEVER know when someone is going to have an episode. It's not worth it to say "it won't happen to ME!"  </TEXT>

I have yo-yo'd around for ten years. I'm 26 now. I was 135ish in 9th grade, which is when I stopped growing (vertically, anyway!) and I'm hoping to get back there (I'm 5'7ish and was a size 6 or 8) 

I slip up all the dang time. Have you tasted buffalo chicken dip?! Do you know about butter?! But I haven't seriously binged in a long time. I have started learning to just take small bites of "bad" stuff and to at least vaguely judge calorie content. 

But I'm not stressing myself out like I have before. I have been trusting my intuition a little more so that I can gradually work into a stricter regimen instead of going crazy on day one and killing my diet every few weeks. 

Today I was super proud because I did well even after a big party yesterday. Today's groceries were all super healthy and tasty. I made a smoothie that my fianc didn't want a second taste of but that I LOVED (banana, spinach, hemp milk, cacao, cashews, chia, mint, coconut oil). 

And I bought new running shoes! Instead of buying cheap shoes over and over that weren't comfortable, I snagged a pair of super comfy Nikes in a pretty color. I would go break them in if it weren't freezing outside and if I didn't have so much meal prep to do! 

I'm getting married in September, and even if I can't lose the whole amount, I want to get at least halfway through!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Realized I sort of low-balled myself when I hired in 17 months ago. Haven't gotten a raise, never discussed it. </TITLE>

<TEXT> My NF is pretty relaxed. I like them, they like me, the whole deal. I only work MWF, 7:30-5:30. There are three kids - 11F, 8F, and 2M - but for most of the day, the older two are in school and I just have the youngest. Still, I'm only making $15 - which is what I made at my last job, which was for much older kids (10M 12F and 14M) who I basically just did pickup and drop off, and helped the youngest with his homework. $15 made sense then and I was only working like 20 hours a week. 

This job is usually 30 hours. The parents are great about being home on time, and the mom will sometimes ask if I can come in on a Tuesday or Thursday if she needs to do work stuff. I think I signed a contract when I hired in but honestly we've all gotten so relaxed with each other that I don't remember. We've never had to use it, that's for sure. 

I have never had to ask for a raise in a nanny situation before. My last job was set in stone, a single year. The one before that was basically just babysitting. The family does pretty well for themselves, so I don't think it would be something they couldn't afford. But I am so nervous about making things weird! And I honestly don't know what to ask for. From what I read on here, $20 seems like what I should have initially asked for, but I think $15-20 is too high of a jump. 

How do I go about negotiating a raise? What should I ask for? I'm in California, for the record, and working in an affluent neighborhood. 

Also, how do you guys normally handle summer? In summer I'll have all three kids all day, like I did last year - much more work. She always covered activities but it was still a ton more work than it was during the school year. Should I get paid more for this? Should I just make sure we have plenty to do and that it's covered by NF?

<TEXT> Semi-related, I went on a trip for NYE. Camped two days then hotel and an event. Realized on the first hotel day that I forgot my makeup bag at home. I legit cried. My brush bag was in my suitcase but my makeup itself was not. 

Luckily there was a Sephora nearby. I figured I'd just spend what I needed to spend, try some new stuff, and return what I didn't need or want when I got home. (God bless that return policy!) Gave me a chance to try some new stuff. 

That said, my list was just over 350 and included: 

Too Faced Hangover Primer 32
Tarte Creaseless Maracuja Concealer 25
Este Lauder Double Wear 40
Laura Mercier Translucent powder travel size 28
ABH Dipbrow 18
Maybelline clear brow gel 4
Too Faced palette (don't remember, one of the chocolate ones. Wasn't a huge fan at all.) 49
Urban Decay Moondust in Midnight Cowboy 21
Buxom Mascara 20
Duo glue 4
Individual lashes (ardell I think.) 4
Tarteist Pro Glow Palette 45
Nars blush in Impassioned (normally I'd buy Goulue but didn't have time for shipping!) 30
Mac Fix+ travel size 10 
UD All Nighter travel size  15
elf tinted balm 2 

And that's a full face with a few options. Honestly it was so weird having to buy a full kit when I have an extensive collection as it is. About 75% of it went back.

<TEXT> I just have to get this all out, it's so good, it's SO GOOD. 

Friendos, the last few years have been a wild time for me. I started this relationship at 20, the quintessential Party Girl who didn't want to settle down ever, drinking way too much even for a college kid and spending every cent that I could get my hands on. I was depressed but unable to confront it. I had terrible spending habits to the point of not being able to afford fifty cents bus fare, let alone lunch at work. I was irresponsible and on a course headed straight for disaster. My semi-abusive parents had recently divorced so my home life was a wreck. I basically didn't see myself making it to 25 at all. 

And then, you know, I don't want to say he SAVED me, especially since we met because I talked his ear off and wouldn't leave him the hell alone at a party, but man oh man did this guy help me. He never pressured me, but did everything he could to help me be a better person. I took it for granted for so long while I was still depressed, but I begrudgingly started taking steps to kick my spending habit about a year ago, four years into our relationship. This man has the patience of a saint. I'm lucky I'm too lazy to pay bills and that it's his job, because we would literally never have electricity on or running water if it wasn't for him taking care of my shit while I've been so depressed that I can't be bothered to keep up any friendships or paint or go outside. 

We've known we wanted to marry each other since very early on, but it took him four years to propose. We've been engaged a year now, taking our time so that we can do this the right way. I still struggled with my spending a little but not nearly as much as before, and I knew how to fix it now. I finally got the help my brain needed and now I'm all, like, emotional? And able to feel joy easily? And able to enjoy things? Bizarre, I know, I know. 

When we started this wedding planning thing, in Southern California where we reside, we knew it was going to be a chunk of change. But oh, man, we still underestimated it. We thought there was no way catering could cost several thousand dollars, or that a venue that allowed us more than a single day would be so far to find. Well, details aside, it's been crazy, and we've been purposefully avoiding talking too much about budget because it sends my stress through the roof and because we had some family things going on that affected how much we were going to receive. 

We finally bit the bullet today, after I have had a rollercoaster emotional day. Who knew that having feelings again would make me cry all the time, right? Like after sex, or in the shower, or in the kitchen when we're cooking dinner and I'm blasting Rihanna because music is good again? I was terrified that we were going to have to drastically cut something from the wedding or the honeymoon, or not honeymoon at all. I was afraid I'd screwed it up even though I'd been trying so hard. I was that little girl dreaming about my wedding day at age three. And I've let so many things in my life go by while I was depressed and have regretted missing out on so many things. I didn't want my wedding to be one of them. I wanted things to be perfect. I was feeling so hopeless about it all without even knowing exact details. The last few months have been wild. I started an anti-depressant that I wasn't sure worked at first, but WOW does it work! And the last week or two I've been antsy thinking about things and testing out how I feel on this medication, but I didn't even want to talk about budget because I felt like something was going to go horribly wrong. 

Anyway, we sat down, deep breath, and recalculated our budget versus expenditures amounts. Down to the single stems of silk flowers we're going to DIY. Down to how many yards of taffeta we're draping over the two big trees at the venue that make up the altar. Down to the exact number of LED tea lights. We had this crazy idea that we were going to do a two week honeymoon, and I'd been looking up ideas and plans all month.

And we're okay! We're more than okay. I cut my personal spending drastically enough that I still have a little spending cash, but we're putting a shit ton into wedding savings ($300 a week, which is a big chunk on our combined salary since I'm part time). We're going to be able to do it all! Our campy four day wedding weekend in the mountains in So Cal, my dream dress, a week on a Caribbean cruise, a week at Disney World, the whole shebang! And we've still got a bit of money for wiggle room/incidentals and a good chunk of spending cash, too. Also, since we've lived together for all of our five years of dating, we have everything we need for a house, so we're only registering for a few physical items and we're doing a honeymoon fund registry, so we'll have a little more cash down the line, too. 

I expressed my happiness to FH, and he patted me on the head and said he was proud of me. And I almost started crying again but then I had to stop dinner from burning, so there's that. 

Anyone else have any recent successes in wedding planning? Feel like celebrating? Ahh!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Running away won't fix anything. Running away won't make things magically work. 

I have been rewatching Gilmore Girls, I'm at the end of season 4. Jess comes to Rory's dorm room and says he needs to talk to her. She tells Dean to go home to his wife, and she lets Jess go off. He says he wants to be with her. That she can depend on him. He wants them to move to New York or anywhere she wants to go, to leave Yale and Stars Hollow and just GO. 

She basically just yells no at him over and over until he gets it. 

My guy didn't get it. I've been thinking about him a bit recently so I was surprised to see this scenario pop up this episode. 

Ryan was the older brother of a girl I had been friends with in elementary school. Ryan was cool, almost too cool, but not in your Football Team cookie cutter kind of way. Ryan had a huge ginger fro and was into Electronic music before it was cool. Ryan hung out with all the older cool kids, and I really mean all of them. Everybody liked Ryan. He was a counselor at the same camp as me and when we went to an amusement park, he smoked pot and got himself kicked out. He always seemed laid back. Fun. 

I don't know how things got to be that way. Different. 

I don't even remember when we started talking again. I don't know. Mild flirtation online. I remember we hung out at a party one night. We hooked up once when i was recently on a very angry break from my old boyfriend. It was all weird. So weird. It wasn't even a long time. That night and maybe one more. And a lot of texting and Facebook. But that was it. This whole thing happened over the course of a month or so. 

He got weirder and weirder. He wouldn't talk to me for a week then he'd call a bunch in one day. 

I got back together with the exboyfriend (stupid move). Ryan was furious, parroting back every complaint i had even briefly mentioned. Telling me this guy was trash. (He was, but I wasn't ready to hear it.) I told him to leave me alone. He told me he wanted to run away together. He wanted me to come with him to Santa Barbara, to leave my friends and family and my job and school. He wanted me to hop on a train and not look back. 

I told him to leave me alone. And I'm glad I did. I'm glad I didn't do the stupid thing. It doesn't work out. Never. Not even on TV. Any guy who has screwed up bad enough to have to propose running away together... he's not worth it. 

He told me he loved me. God, he was nuts. He showed up at my house one time. I pretended I wasn't home. He also called, over and over. I shut my phone off and when I turned it back on my mailbox was full, and he kept calling.  His voicemails and social media messages went something to the tune of "I'm going to tell your boyfriend you cheated on him" and "you basically forced me to sleep with you that night" (lies) and "I'm going to tell everyone you raped me."  A 22 year old guy with seven inches and sixty pounds on me, a 5'5 150lbs soaking wet college freshman with a bad back. Right. 

He kept threatening me, and calling. And leaving messages. 

I blocked him on every social media outlet, blocked his number. I hope he's doing better. He was a pretty nice guy before all of this. I asked a few of his friends that I grew up with how he was doing. Several years ago. He was fine. I'm glad. I hope he got his head in the right place. 

Rory obviously didn't have to deal with this guy. Jess left, after he asked her if she really meant NO. She said it again, fear making her shoulders rise, unable to even look at him, and he left. 

It's scary. Being confronted like that. The guy could be a saint otherwise, but I haven't seen it happen like that. A guy who is obviously feeling something very strong. A guy desperate enough to just show up and ask you to stop caring about everything else in your life so you can solely care about him. 

I have never told anyone the full story here. I was afraid of him. That day he showed up at my house? He stopped because there were no other cars in the driveway. I saw him looking. I barely got a glimpse of his car through the kitchen window. He didn't see me. I kept the doors locked and a thick tire iron in my room. I thought I had known him, but clearly I didn't. You hear so many horror stories. I genuinely feared for my life. 

And he made me feel that way. All because he thought he loved me.

Basically, they stick these thick ass needles into a bunch of your muscles in a hundred different spots and make you flex those muscles - with the needle still in! - to see how the muscles respond. It is somehow even more painful than it sounds. But the doctor was like, this-guy-level cute and SO funny. He kept trying to make me laugh because I was obviously in pain. Once he realized I didn't have a stick up my butt and could take a joke, dude was relentless. 

A few gems were: 
"you know, some people like when their partner inflicts a little pain!" 

"That's why I took this job, actually, I get off on causing people pain over and over again. And I get paid for it! Really well." 

And, once we were done and he was finishing reading stuff, he just let out a big sigh and said "I hope it was as good for you as it was for me" 

I left that office still laughing so hard I had tears, and then afterwards I ran into him in the hall and he winked at me and I couldn't even be subtle, I just started cackling.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not OP but I am also raving about ELDW. I went through probably fifty different foundations trying to find something that would stay on my uber-pale, finicky, dehydrated-but-oily face. I tend to get oily on my nose but my skin is fairly dehydrated and can get uneven texture that lesser foundations settle into. ELDW comes in a zillion shades and STAYS ON. Plus, for me at least, when I press powder on to set and use a setting spray, I have the most gorgeous satin/natural finish. Ive never had a foundation like this. Magic.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Awesome! Sounds like they really meshed and had a good time. I'd say dinner or something casual is a fine next meeting. If you want to wait a week or so, feel free! But time between meetings won't change a ton except YOUR comfort level. If you need to wait, wait. If your sister and girlfriend want to see each other again, set it up. But don't take too long before meetings. I know you feel a lot of pressure to protect your sister, I totally get that. But if you sit down with her and explain what's going on, it'll make you feel better that she has a better understanding. 

I'd say a next step before another meeting is sitting down with your sister and making sure she knows what's going on - that you've been with your girlfriend a long time and wanted to reeeally make sure things were serious before the girlfriend got to meet her. Explain that you have been thinking about your future - and by that I mean yours and your sisters, mainly - and that you are an adult who might want to get married some day. It might be this girlfriend; it might not. But you've talked about it. Reassure her that she'll always come first. 7 is old enough for a girl to know how boyfriends and girlfriends work and what marriage is. If you better prepare her for either option - a breakup or a marriage - it'll be easier for her in the long run. Holding off and keeping them apart for periods of time could make a marriage difficult eventually. They need to get comfortable with each other! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm moderately disabled, I have a spinal cord condition that gives me a lot of nerve pain and weakness. Add anxiety at large events on top of that (the world is a scary place!) and an antidepressant that I just started and makes me feel a little overwhelmed... I don't know. I didn't know if I could handle it. I thought about going for days. I didn't want to ask anyone I knew if they were going. 

Finally last night I posted asking if anyone was interested in going. Within minutes I had two dear friends willing to carpool. I threw together this sign last night at like 2AM and almost didn't bring it because I've never done anything like this before and I was worried people would think my sign was silly. (Brains!) LA was a madhouse but it was beautiful. One friend had to leave early for work and my body was shutting down, so we left around 2 but still got some good time in since we'd gotten there At 9AM. 

People loved my sign (soooo many people took pictures of me/it) and since we were leaving early, I waited until we were near parking. A middle-aged couple was walking towards the biggest crowds past us and the woman said she loved my sign, so I gave it to her. Passed the torch. 

I struggled with identifying as a feminist for so long, but coming to terms with who I am as a person and as a woman made it impossible for me to hold off any longer. I'm a feminist. A bisexual, disabled, chronically ill, mentally ill feminist who had an amazing day surrounded by supportive, amazing people. 

Thank you, everyone who marched in person and in spirit. I love you. Thank you.  </TEXT>

We're Disneyland APs so didn't know how crazy WDW dining was and thus didn't make reservations. (Plus, we were with a group of 12/lots of small kids). Went one day just myself, boyfriend, and his sister. We walked up to see if anything was available for 3, but nope. They had a table for two, but we didn't want to ditch my fiance's sister and ended up turning it down. I still regret it. We got lucky but definitely have a backup plan!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was 20 when my parents split and my sister was 17 - she got to pick where to go. I luckily moved out right around the time of the divorce so I didn't have to worry about it. 

It's very common for the "left behind" parent to accuse the other one of turning kids against them. My sister chose to live with my mom because she was closer to her. My dad got upset about that. 

On the other hand, when they were first fighting and my mom moved out for a bit, I sided with my dad and stayed there. She accused him of turning me against her. It happened both ways and NEITHER of them were right. 

It was kind of shitty for your dad to let out why the divorce was going on, especially so soon when you're still dealing with everything. But what's done is done. You're staying with your dad and besides that, he seems to be trying to be as neutral as possible. That's good. 

Your mom is behaving badly. Regardless of WHY they divorced, she's not handling this the right way. Let her know that you love her and you don't want things to be like this, but her attitude about the situation and her accusations are making you uncomfortable. Let her know you're preferring to spend less time with her because it's putting a lot of unwanted stress on you and you don't like that she makes you feel that way. 

It's going to be tough for a while but it WILL get better. My parents are on fine terms a few years later.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alright there's no mistranslating calling me selfish, so let me remind you of two important things: 

1. I mentioned both here and to him that I was tired from errands. We had been out all day, on our feet, doing stuff. Walking aimlessly and tiring myself further was not something that sounded appealing. And HE first said "let's walk SOMEWHERE". But he had no ideas of his own, which is typical for him, so I listed stuff off. It's not about making it about myself. I wanted to take what he wanted to do and make it enjoyable for both of us. It wouldn't have been enjoyable to either of us if I was impatient and tired and my feet hurt while we just wandered around. Refused to go unless it was on my terms? I wanted to find a compromise. 

2. Is this not a support-ish sub? Call me crazy, but this set of subs is set up to vent about and get support for annoying and/or crazy shit our families and partners do. My partner did a slightly annoying thing that he has been known to do when I don't immediately agree to his ideas. I just needed to vent it out there, not be chastised on how I handle my relationship.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's actually [much simpler than I thought. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/d2gGL) and a little rudimentary but functional. I didn't realize how simple it was. I could probably have done this lol. 

The side with the existing shelf underneath, there are two pieces of metal already there. He bent two little brackets out flat to hold the wood on that side, and just used two more in the regular way on the other side. Didn't screw any of it down, just let it rest on the brackets. The shelving was not the exact depth of the desk so that's why those other brackets are laid flat - to hold it in. 

They do! Phillips Hue makes White Ambiance smart bulbs that have something like zillions of different shades of "white". I am still trying to decide if I want to splurge on the Ambiance bulbs or just stick with their neutral white dimmable bulbs. 

And yessss I know, it's weird how much I like them too. I think I have one in every finish now? Maybe? I don't know. I love the mattes and comfort mattes, but the sheers are so gorgeous. I have Sheer Ladyflower! I was OBSESSED with Cruel for the holidays (magic red with glitter that STAYED PUT!) But I'm looking forward to spring so I can break out Weirdo, which ends up like a bright-ish peachy neutral on me. 

And I just have an Echo Dot but I love it. Got it for Christmas because I have dreams of turning this 430 square foot apartment into a smart tech haven. One fixture at a time...  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you! 

The IKEA table pictured (Vittsjo) is a glass top, but the wood underneath was only in that square area towards the bottom/right - there was no shelving underneath the rest of it when we bought it. My fianc rigged it with a few brackets and a piece of dark colored shelving from Home Depot so that the wood went all the way across underneath, so that it could store things. (He did the work because I am prone to seriously injuring myself whenever hammers/saws are involved. ADD is cool.) 

We then bought stackable bamboo storage organizers from The Container Store - enough to cover the bottom shelf without spilling over the edge. I configure them so that the metal bar from the desk frame doesn't keep me from pulling them out. All my makeup down there is sorted and organized from left to right in the order that I use it. 

On top are acrylic drawers from Amazon (so cheap that way!) that came in a variety of shapes. The drawers have more eye palettes, my blushes/bronzes/highlighters, false lashes, tools (extra powder puffs, makeup removers, blotting sheets, etc) and anything else that didn't fit. 

I used to do my makeup on my bed all the time and surrounded myself with a pile of stuff, so I feel super fancy sitting down at my vanity now, even though I only sit down to do my makeup like once a week since I don't wear makeup to work!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fianc helped me customize an IKEA laptop table into a vanity a few years ago. My old mirror was a crappy four dollar Walmart mirror with some strip lights wired to it, my new one is a nicer IKEA glass mirror. I'm planning on adding a little more frame and flowers to make it look kind of like [this ](http://pin.it/BnCC0vh) but different. Maybe all white flowers? And smart bulbs, so I can yell at Alexa to turn my vanity lights on/make them dimmable. 

We used to live in a big four bedroom townhouse with roommates, and there was plenty of room. Now we live in a tiny apartment (but thankfully alone!), which has a weird 5 foot by 5 foot closet-ish space with a window. We've dubbed it "my room" and it houses my vanity and that shelf, which is also new. For the first six months or so that we lived here, it was just a pile of my stuff with the vanity barely usable. Now I can actually use the room! 

I recently added the acrylic drawers on top (amazon!), reorganized the wooden bins under the glass, and updated the aforementioned mirror. It's so clean and I can see everything! 

Edit: added something.

<TEXT> I had this dude on Reddit one time try and run a conversation in circles in a way that he was accusing me of being a rapist sympathizer. I'm a rape survivor and his argument was totally convoluted (HE brought up rape in an almost entirely disconnected conversation then tried to say I did?) then went on to harass me. 

The post was in TwoX taking about women appreciating when their men are extra careful in asking for consent/very respectful about it. I shared a story. Just a story. Nothing big. I don't even remember how this fucking guy worked this around to me encouraging rape culture but, ya know, fucktards on the internet. 

He didn't make it very hard to find him online. His reddit history was atrocious - misogyny, harassment, threats, all kinds of fun shit. I sat my ass down at a Starbucks over a pumpkin spice latte and went ham on this dude. 

I never could find his mom, but I DID find his little sister who apparently really looked up to him/was close with him. His little sister who, if memory serves me right, is a queer feminist. She got a message and links. And oh, his favorite small time band that he basically ran the fan club for? They got a link and screenshots too, with a note that "if I were you, I certainly wouldn't want my personal brand related to someone who talks to people like that". 

Welp. Iiiiiif you're going to be a tool on the internet and not hide who you are, don't be surprised when someone calls you out on it.  </TEXT>

You already sound like you know you want to dump her. This relationship is not making you happy. End things, enjoy your trip with a buddy, hit the gym, something something something.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, you did the right thing in writing things down and deciding to come clean. It can take a lot of guts to admit to a professional that you haven't been completely honest, and even more to completely open up and let them know what's really going on. 

My anxiety used to make me make things up all the time - I don't even know why I was lying half of the time. It was a crappy reaction and I realized that it wasn't helping anyone but I did it anyway. I didn't see a therapist for five years because I was convinced that I couldn't make it work for me because I would freak out and make things seem more or less important than they actually were. 

I went back last week and was 98% honest with my new person. One or two times I said something dumb, but trivial things. I don't know if it's maturity or what but I knew I really needed help this time. 

I'm proud of you for taking steps to get real, honest help 3  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very pale (NW15 is sometimes too dark) lady looking for some sculpting/contouring/bronzing powders. I specifically am looking for the Kevyn Aucoin powder in light, if anyone has a well-loved one that they're not using that I could try out before committing to the full thing. If someone also has a new one they're willing to part with for less than retail, I would probably be into that too. 

Sephora Tranquil is a bit TOO gray and dark, even with a very light hand. 

Hoola looks very bronze on me and can look very orange depending on what foundation I'm using at the time/where I place Hoola. 

Thank you!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Fake flowers - what's worth it? Who did you use? I just got screwed over by a SECOND diva florist. I'm done. Floral crisis. Send booze. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-06 02:06:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Screwed over is maybe harsh, but I'm a little fed up with florists. 

First off, we're getting married in San Diego county. Shit is expensive, even though we're getting married up in the mountains and having a laid-back, mostly-family wedding weekend for four days. Florists don't seem to get this. I put in six inquiries at first, and four of them quoted me for some exorbitantly large arrangements and way more flowers than I asked for. The other two were booked. Okay. 

I waited a few more weeks and asked a few more - enter Florist One. Florist One worked with me for a full month and a half. When the quote finally looked perfect, I asked her how to pay - she asked us to pay the deposit before she'd even draw up an official contract. Before I could reply and say that made us uncomfortable, she sent a clipped email saying that someone else had booked her. What? She claims that someone just instantly paid the deposit through a paypal link on her page, without even talking to her. Whatever. She was majorly unprofessional in handling the fallout, so I left a negative review online. She then tried to get it taken down, claiming I was lying about her asking for the deposit before she wrote a contract. They asked me, I provided a screenshot that said she actually had done that. They left the review up but she had zero remorse for how she handled the situation until the review was already done and up. 

Florist Two comes in later - I found them on The Knot, a little desperate. Everyone else I had contacted was booked already. They could only meet certain weekdays, so I went down there with FH and we met for an hour or so. They were pretty helpful but their English wasn't great, so I think a few things were missed. There was a lot of attitude, too, almost very smug? Like we asked a few questions and they'd just look at each other and then give a very condescending "lesson" on what we actually meant. Most of the time, no, I meant what I said. They were just suggesting totally different things I didn't like. I felt a little uneasy but let them know I'd be sending a few pictures of centerpieces I liked to get a better feel for sizing. Two or so weeks later I email them and guess what? They're booked for my date now. 

So, now I'm several months into trying to book a florist. We've still got months to go but I'm overwhelmed and can barely be made to do any planning lately. Most florists in the area are VERY expensive. My mom has a friend who does events just for fun (including the greenery garlands I desperately want but are too expensive through a traditional florist) but I'm skeptical. Also, my mom is an asshole so she won't just give me the girl's number to talk to her myself, my mom wants all the credit for organizing this so she wants me to go through her. Not something I want. My mom is uncooperative at times and I feel bad asking this friend, even though she supposedly loves doing it. I don't even know how i would compensate her as she usually does this stuff for free or very cheap and I don't know that she's done a full wedding before, but my mom has shown me pictures of her dessert tables and florals and they're super pretty. 

Brides who have used alternative florals - HOW? Did you DIY? Los Angeles has a great floral market, we're just South of LA, I could always get them on the Thursday before we drive down to SD, even though the wedding is Saturday afternoon. Or I could have my mom's friend pick them up, since she goes often and does this, as my mom said she was willing to come up Fri/Sat/Sun to help. 

Clay? Paper? Wood? I have seen a ton of different ideas but I'm overwhelmed. I want something full of greenery and really lush and wild looking for my bouquet, but everything else is smaller and mossy, hopefully. I can DIY my own moss stuff, but how expensive are fake flowers? Too much to do a whole wedding? Centerpieces?? 

I am having a crisis over flowers. FLOWERS. Before wedding planning started, I was excited to plan our wedding. Now I'm a half step away from showing up in jeans and just getting plastered drunk on champagne while everyone eats hot dogs.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah you need to not go back, ever. If the stuff she pawned is her parent's stuff (which seems highly likely) and YOU removed it from the house, she could try to pin it on you. Take note of everything weird that has happened lately, what you saw. But don't go back and don't keep being an accessory to all of this. You might want to just send her a text letting her know she'll need to find someone else starting immediately, that you're majorly uncomfortable with the situation and that you won't be returning.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wouldn't reply to him - he's just going to keep insulting you and pushing your buttons. You owe him nothing. You're incompatible. That's more than enough. 

If your friend asks how it goes, let her know that you're just not compatible people. And that when you told him it wasn't going to continue, he insulted you and made some very rude comments. 

Odds are she sees only the best in her brother. She's never dated him obviously so she probably doesn't know this side of him at all. It doesn't need to be "tattling" on him but maybe let her know her brother is not someone she should set her friends up with.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed with this math, and also chiming in with my own pay - I work 30 per week, 10 hours each for 3 days. I make 15 an hour but most of the day, the two older kids are in school and I hang out with the toddler. 

I make 450/wk. I feel that's about right since I'm mainly only with one kid, but still on the lower end. I think you could reasonably ask for $450 (plus an additional hourly rate for anything over 35 hours or so) with the understanding that you can reassess in six months or so.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sounds like your skin did what my skin did. I tried several different routines and products, hated how it looked, considered going on Accutane, and then... it cleared up. Now I barely wash my face, maybe once or twice a week, just moisturize most days. I used to have tons of those closed comedones and the cysts in the same places - jaw and chin. 

My skin sort of miraculously cleared up. I am also 25 (getting older) and my diet has changed a little so maybe that's helping. No clue. I did try Curology for a few months but now haven't used it in two months and it's still gone. Every time I see myself in the mirror I expect to see acne and redness and peeling and scars but my skin is nice. I still have no idea what happened. Maybe magic. I'm okay with that. Your skin looks so good! I'm so happy for you.  </TEXT>

If someone wants to dot on some fake freckles because they like the look, what's the big deal? This whole "I like your makeup but I HATE FAKE FRECKLES AHGGAKXNE" thing feels a little like telling someone "I HATE push up bras/fake boobs, they're awful and they need to die because I DONT LIKE THEM but your dress looks nice I guess." What. 

Makeup is supposed to be FUN, including fake freckles and fake lashes and foundation and contour and shimmering highlights you can see from spaaaaace and purple mother fuckin' lipstick. FUN. FUUUUN. LEAVE BRITNEY ALONE!!! /rant  </TEXT>

I've been accused of faking my freckles a few times when I wear sheer foundations or nothing on my face. 

Everyone gets poked fun of for their features. Some people get teased about freckles, or hair, or boobs! But people fake freckles and people dye their hair and people get fake boobs or reductions or whatever all the damn time. Why get mad?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to do this all the time. I didn't realize how bad it was until later, but I still stand by the idea that it wasn't a "bad" thing to do. Mostly, when I said things like that, it's just because I was trying to relate. I always always had older friends, 2-10 years older, so when someone would tell me about something cool they had done/gotten, I would return with something similar that happened because I wanted them to realize I was "on their level" or that I was mature enough/experienced enough to deserve to be there. It's a compensation thing. Self-worth. They're looking for praise. 

Confrontation doesn't help this situation much, and neither would sarcastic comments like another poster said - it'll really just hurt her feelings and further that need to belong. If it's overt, like someone got a big promotion and she has something to say, just deflect it a bit - say "cool", ask a question, and go back to talking about the other person. Or if you really want to talk to her about it, be supportive. Let her know that you all value her friendship so much but that when she does that, you feel like she's not being supportive of or happy for your other friends, and that it makes that person feel less than in their big moment or makes them feel like she doesn't care about them. Relating it to how she is probably feeling is going to be a more successful strategy than sarcasm.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a lab/Shepherd/Rhodesian Ridgeback mix dog growing up. She was the dumbest, most playful dog I have ever met. She thought she was a lap dog. But ooh, man, did she protect our house. That mailman was not a fan. He couldn't even bribe her with treats, she'd crouch and wait until he got alllll the way up to the door, started putting the mail in, and THEN she'd jump up and scare him off. 

Also, seconding the self defense idea. I am also disabled and have taken an adaptive class just to help me in case I ever need to get myself out of a situation. I'm no pro boxer but if someone tried to grab me or attack me, they're going to land on their ass. Most self defense isn't about being stronger than your opponent, just knowing the right moves to disable them or get yourself free and get out of there. I have a spinal condition and degenerative muscle issues but I could take down a large grown man even if he attacked my weak side. None of what I learned was super specific to a certain discipline, either, so I'm sure any place near you that teaches SD can help.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mean, technically nobody really "deserves" a bonus, the reward you get for putting in hard work is the paycheck you receive... that's the point of a job. 

But it is much appreciated when one IS received. Usually depends on the financial situation of the parents and whether or not they've given bonuses to prior nannies, if they have had any. Last year I was very surprised to get a bonus of several hundred dollars from my current NF, who I had only been with for a few months at the time. But they've had plenty of professional nannies in the past and they're financially pretty comfortable so this is just the norm for them. I had no expectations of receiving one. I admit I'm curious if I'll receive the same this year but I'm not counting on it in any way.  </TEXT>

I have an ex who couldn't commit to ME, years later, my last before my now fianc. That ex couldn't stop showing up late, not calling when he said he would, the whole deal. Made me realize what I'd done to the first guy. 

And now I'm getting married and I see both of those guys happy and it STILL hurts, 7 and 5 years later. What if I'd changed for Kevin? What if Matt had changed for me? What was different about these other partners? 

Ah, well, I fixed most of my issues a while ago, and now I am getting married to someone after I got smart and got older. Kevin's girlfriend is a lucky girl if she's still got him. Matt's girlfriend... actually, Matt turned into an asshole, so I don't know how she puts up with him, but he committed, so who knows what was different about her.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah fuck anyone who says anything about the dress you pick. Your body. Your wedding. I went and tried on dresses last Sunday with my mom, future MIL, future SIL, and my grandmother. Everyone wanted me to get this poofy A-line deal that had weird butt wings - I don't know how else to describe it - there was weird layering of lace in the back and the lace flipped up near my butt. I had butt wings. Newer Hayley Paige so I can't find a picture. Butt. Wings. The top was super flattering and pretty but the bottom looked like someone awkwardly stapled lace drapes on a dress but only around the butt wings. 

I'm a true hourglass but a size 12 top and bottom, measurements for a 6/8 in the middle. A-lines look good on me, typically! But I wanted something easier and more comfortable than that, not a lot of poof, so when I found a relatively straight cut dress (Catherine Deane - Genevieve, found at BHLDN, zero poof!) I fell in love. Everyone kept saying the Hayley Paige dress (which was more than twice as much, and again - BUTT WINGS) was the best and was totally my dress. Everyone kept muttering that the other dress was more flattering. But fuck that. I'm not really here so other people can decide my waist and shoulders look better in this or that. 

My dress is going to look bomb, your dress looks bomb, everyone else can just get. out.  </TEXT>

25F, wearing this dress in Plum for Engagement photos tomorrow at Disneyland. I wanted to feel a little festive and cute without going either red or white. I have a pair of taupe strappy/cut out flat ankle boots I'm thinking of wearing with it because I don't have many pairs of cute shoes. I am a size 12 and fairly self-conscious about my shape so I don't typically dress up much except for special occasions. 

What would be best to accessorize? I've never had pictures taken like this. I am admittedly bad at anything fashion related. And does anyone have ideas for hair or makeup? I'm going to get my hair and makeup professionally done because while I'm good at doing my own makeup, I wouldn't want to risk it (or even attempt to tame my hair) with something so important. Definitely false lashes. I am not afraid to go dramatic with makeup but don't know if it would be too much to do a dark lip, which is sort of my standard. 

Thanks in advance! 

Edit: I bought sheer tights as one option but not sure about those either, especially with cutout boots. Would this look weird?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Arizona Winter Camping. Site ideas? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Going camping for just a couple of days before a music festival in Chandler for NYE. I've done plenty of winter camping in Southern California but haven't camped at all in AZ. Anyone have any favorite spots? I have looked into a few sites but it's so hard to tell unless you've been there and many are closed for the winter. I'm partially disabled but can do short hikes (4 or 5 miles RT) and would maybe want to do one while we're there. Something with a great view would be awesome, and hopefully not too busy but we're willing to brave a few crowds for the right spot. Tent camping, we've got all our own gear but not enough to go full wilderness camping, etc. We're hoping to not go too far East, anything on the West side of the state is ideal. Thanks!

<TEXT> If I had just read the post and not any of your follow-up comments, I'd say give it a shot. "Once a cheater always a cheater" is bullshit. I heavily cheated on two of my exes because I was 18/19 and they didn't make me happy but I didn't have the confidence to leave them. But I have never cheated on and will never cheat on my SO, who I am marrying in a year. Some people do change and mature. 

But your guy's lack of explanation and evasive statements would make me turn and run. He can't even be honest and remorseful, he's just trying to make his ex look crazy so you don't believe it. Don't waste your time.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Planning a wedding three hours from home. A last minute dream bridal salon opening while already on the way to a vendor meeting. Just feeling a bit of unplanned wedding planning serendipity going on. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-01 23:24:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There's a bridal salon (The Dress Theory, San Diego CA) that I've been fangirling over for as long as I can remember. I never thought I'd actually be able to make an appointment there - lots of family to cart around and plenty of shops near where I live in LA. So I said it was okay, maybe some time, but sort of gave up. I had ideations of going by myself because my family is fairly opinionated. I actually have two appointments on Sunday with six people each. I could not have said no to any of them. 

Today my fianc is taking a half day off work (my off day) to come to a florist meeting. Yeah, we have to drive like three hours every time we want to meet with a vendor, but it's fine. We have family in SD we like to see anyway. 

But I wake up this morning after he leaves and The Dress Theory pops into mind. I think, what the hell, they're busy people, but maaayybe they have an opening today. I just felt like it was supposed to happen. Today was the day. And I was previously someone who didn't want my fianc to see me in anything remotely bridal before the wedding day, but he's my best friend and I really trust his opinion when it comes to what looks good. So, you know, it could be fun if they had an opening. 

Well, they didn't. But that was okay. I was going to make an appointment for another day. It was fine, only mildly disappointing, but I often get excited over weird shit so it was no biggie. I got in the car, we started driving down, and then I get another email - they just had a cancellation! For this afternoon! After my florist meeting! I immediately start squealing in the car and I'm so stinkin' happy. We also just found the perfect caterer this past weekend, so it's all falling into place all at once! Ah! And we get to see one of my favorite members of my fiance's family today! 

I'll update ya after my swim in tulle, magic is real, bye!!!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Strong lip/eye looks without foundation. Thoughts? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-24 22:27:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi! So this is a thing I haven't played around with much before. I used to have acne that ranged from mild to moderate and TONS of hormonal redness and flaking. I hated my skin and would only buy super full coverage foundations. Because of this (and my love for smoky eyes) I think it just became a weird rule in my head - I couldn't wear eyeshadow unless I had full foundation on. Obviously most people scale coverage in foundation and intensity in eye looks fairly equally, but I could not figure out what was so weird about it for me for soooo long. 

Over the last four months or so I've been doing new stuff with my skin. My acne has COMPLETELY cleared up and I have almost no redness. I still have some healing spots (dark pinkish but small) and some permanent small scarring. (You can see a picture of this and my progress in my post history, I posted my bare face to SCA! Something I thought I would never do!) But I feel okay going out with makeup now, where I used to hate being bare-faced. 

Today I did a full smoky purple/cranberry eye. A little blush and bronzer. Highlight. Full brows. But no foundation. A touch of concealer under my eyes. That's it. I grabbed the foundation bottle and I am doing my makeup in the car so I didn't want to deal with the work of putting on foundation in the car. 

I love it! I get to let my skin breathe and it looks natural. I don't have to spend my whole holiday blotting and reapplying and touching up. But if you saw someone on the street with a full eye look and no foundation, would you think it looks weird? I don't see if often and wonder if there's some unspoken rule about following that scale - dark eye needs foundation.

I remember seeing a post here ages ago actually with a girl who did this with a dark lip (maybe it was blue? Maybe!) and I loved it. She's actually been sort of my inspiration for this whole love-my-skin, let-it-breathe movement. Ah! 

I'll still wear it for any time I want to look really nice and even out my scarring, but I may stick to this from now on. 

Thoughts?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My dad and stepmom tried to get me to get my dress MADE by their "seamstress friend" in downtown LA. They used two examples (my step moms wedding dress and my stepsisters quinceanera dress) both of which were laser pure white "reproductions" of designer dresses. Not only did these dresses look almost nothing like the originals, part of my step moms dress tore in the middle of their ceremony. But they were like "she's a pro! She'll give you a really good deal! She can exactly remake any dress you want for $500!" 

No thanks, Dad. Ends up that was the only way he was willing to contribute to my wedding. If I let him buy my wedding dress and if it was through this seamstress. Forget the fact that my family has a tradition - women have their dresses bought by their maternal grandmothers. It's gone on for a few generations now. It's what we do. Post-divorce my dad decided the only way he'd help with my wedding was if I broke this tradition. Nope. 

Between that and other problems, my dad is lucky he's being INVITED to my wedding. Why do parents insist on doing crazy shit like this?! Ugh.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Rant/advice needed: A florist screwed us over and double booked after asking for a deposit BEFORE sending a contract. I left a bad review, she's disputing it, but she's lying. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-22 19:19:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay, this is annoying and I have had no bad wedding planning things happen up to this point (besides my dream caterer being 2x my budget and me having to turn them down) so this is really rubbing me the wrong way. I figure you guys might have some advice or wisdom on the situation. 

I am getting married next September in San Diego county, about two and a half hours south of where I live. Vendors are expensive in CA in general but San Diego in particular seems to be a financial drain. We have had a sort of tricky time finding people to meet our budget and our vision, but nothing too bad. We started looking into florists a little over a month ago. 

I immediately found one I liked. She had a rough pricing outline on her site that fit well within our conservative budget and allowed for some play room. Her work was beautiful. I sent her and three other florists messages for quotes, and she was the ONLY one still available. Apparently affordable florists book up fast 'round these parts. 

We started going over a customized quote. We talked to her over several weeks, once or twice on the phone. She totally got our vision and was initially a dream to work with. On a Tuesday, I asked her how a contract and deposit worked for her, and she replied Wednesday night letting me know that a deposit of $250 had to be made via a paypal link on her site BEFORE she'd send over a contract. Red flag. It was already late into Wednesday evening by the time I got the email, so I figured I'd email her Thursday morning. 

Thursday morning I receive a very curt email from her stating only "Just wanted to inform you that another couple has booked with me on your same date and I'm no longer available. Good luck!" 

This, less than 36 hours after I told her I wanted to book with her. I didn't even get a chance to express my concern over putting in a deposit before the contract was sent over. 

I replied expressing my frustration since we'd been working together for weeks and now she'd apparently booked someone else in less than 18 hours after she'd told me how to pay. 36 hours since I'd asked to book with her. I was now much farther behind on booking a florist in a high-demand region. I let her know that I thought her handling of the situation was unprofessional and that I'd be writing a negative review on a few sites to reflect that. 

THAT'S WHAT THESE THINGS ARE FOR. To express delight or concern with a vendor. 

That's when her attitude changed - she was sooooo sorry it happened, she didn't mean to upset me and it was never her intention to upset anyone. This other bride apparently just booked her via the paypal link on her site without ever talking to her. She claimed she'd never spoken to this bride before and that the lady had just sent her $250 so she had to book with them first over me. 

First of all, the paypal link thing? Doesn't seem right. If it's someone you've already been talking to and that's your preferred payment method, fine. But booking a florist without even talking to them? Plus it's not like paypal lists her available dates. This person would have sent over $250 without even knowing if she was free for their date. It doesn't seem right to me. But that's almost beside the point. 

I left a short review about how I felt the handling of the situation was unprofessional and how she really only tried to remedy the situation after I mentioned writing a negative review. She said negative reviews affected her livelihood and asked me to remove it or edit it. I told her I might remove it, because I'd been angry, but that I wasn't happy with how she handled it and that she should make changes to how she does her booking so she doesn't screw anyone else over like this. 

She swore she'd change the way she did it - she hasn't. Her website is unchanged, link still up. 

Still, I emailed The Knot about editing or removing my review because I had been upset when I left it. They seemed to bounce me around for a few days between departments but this morning it finally came out - she's disputing the review and claiming that I lied about her asking for the deposit before the contract. They highlighted the section in my review where I mentioned that that was a red flag for me, and stated that she'd told them it was just a miscommunication and that she'd provided some sort of evidence that she hadn't said that. 

Well, I took a screen shot of the email where she'd asked me to do exactly that. The wording isn't vague. She says "The contract will be sent to you after placing your reservation fee of $250." AFTER. She stated explicitly that she'd send the contract AFTER we paid the fee. She even attached a sample contract stating that it would look "similar" to ours, and that she'd write the contract after receiving payment.  

So I emailed The Knot back with that screen shot attached to let them know that I'd like the review to remain up now, it all it's glory. She only half-assed tried to remedy the situation after I told her about reviews, and then she tried to have it removed anyway even though it was all 100% true. 

Am I right to want to leave it up? This has all been a huge headache. If deleting the review would make this go away it would almost be worth it, but I don't want someone else to get disappointed the way I did and her handling of the situation, boiling down to accusing me of lying, is absurd. 

I feel like The Knot is handling this the best they can. But they did ask me to edit or remove that section. I replied with the screen shot so I'm hoping they see I'm not lying. I'm not taking that part down. That's the part that was the big red flag to begin with. And to be honest, she's lucky I only left the review on The Knot and didn't go to every freaking website I know to leave one. This is just tacky. She handled it unprofessionally and now she's saying I'm lying. 

She also won't stop emailing me! I told her to leave me alone, that I'd find a new florist on my own and didn't want her help. She has emailed me every day, sometimes multiple times a day, for the last week. I haven't responded to her at all after telling her I would do things on my own. I feel like I can't get away from this woman. After SHE messed up. 

I let The Knot know she was lying, but if they come to me with any more doubts I'm showing them every pestering email she's sent me since this happened. 

AHHHHHHHHH.  </TEXT>

Regular usage since June of this year. Probably not every day, maybe 5/7 days a week for the first half then every day for the last half. 

This is my holy grail moisturizer. My skin can be pretty sensitive/VERY prone to breakouts and gets oily midday around my t-zone and my cheeks. This has improved the texture of my skin so much, even before I changed anything else about my routine. And it feels so refreshing! Not heavy or slick at all. 

I tried to buy the lotion instead. Sephora was out of the gel in the size I liked, so I tried the lotion. Nope. Nooooope. Back to the mall immediately. Exchanged for the gel two days later.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> MAC has their new Spellbinder shadows - the shade Retrograde is a gorgeous sapphire blue that applies well with a brush and would be a great mid-lid color on like a gray/sapphire/black smoky eye. 

Another pretty blue is the MUFE artist shadow in Sapphire - same deal. A nice lid color that could be augmented with gray and black. 

Alternately, you could do a basic gray/cool smoky eye with a metallic blue inner corner highlight. I like to take my inner corner shadows a little farther on the lids when I do this to really make it stand out. Then it's not a heavy heavy blue but it's a very noticeable pop.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay, this is my first time really planning anything of this magnitude and I'm not super sure about any of this. But it was my impression that you always signed a contract before sending a deposit. Is this true? Are there cases where you'd deposit before signing a contract? I know my photographer did it at the same time, as did my venue. But my florist is requesting $250 be sent over before she writes up the contract. This strikes me as off. I don't know if she's new (she seems to be a small scale florist, I've seen examples of her work but she's very affordable and she is on the major wedding sites) or if this is just a thing with smaller vendors? 

Has anyone done this before? My brain is just uncomfortable with sending this woman money over PayPal without any kind of contract written up, but it's a good deal and she's willing to come to our venue up a mountain. Agh.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "These four years have been mostly good." I'm gonna stop you there and tell you a story. 

When I was like 17 I had this boyfriend who really liked going down on me. He was pretty freaking good at it so I never minded. I was on weird birth control that made me really irregular. I think you n is where this is going. 

One day he went down south and came up with a confused look and a mouth full of blood. I was so embarrassed, apologized profusely, reiterated that my BC made me start randomly (I used to, no joke, start on Tuesdays first thing when I woke up. Exactly every four weeks, when I woke up.) and that I was so so sorry and he didn't have to do that until I was off my BC in case it happened again. 

He just shrugged, cleaned his face off, got me stuff to clean up, and said it wasn't my fault. 

If a fucking 17 year old guy can get over period blood face, your grown ass adult boyfriend should be able to handle a little surprise blood. And for that matter, any man who pressures a woman about her body is just gross. 

Don't waste your time with a dude that's freaking out about your tummy and your period. Don't waste your time on a relationship that you only described as "mostly good." If he's not actually amazing and this isn't just a weird out of character reaction, he's super immature. What is this guy going to react like if you ever have children? Or if you ever have to just be around children? Or if, god forbid, you have another surprise period? Agh.

<TEXT> The best thing that has helped my marks has actually just been a heavy, heavy amount of hydration. I've found that using an exfoliant or any kind of thing that's supposed to fade marks just irritates my skin. I stopped trying for a while. The thing that finally started helping fade my marks was kind of odd. My skin was dehydrated and took forever to heal. On my times where I take a few days break from Curology (I only use it probably twice or three times a week right now) I like using Sephora brand sleep masks. There's an "Ultra Moisturizing and Brightening" one that I'm obsessed with. Forgot to mention it in my routine. It's like $4 for a tiny little thing, but I can get three uses out of it if I can seal the rest of it in something airtight. I used to use the corner of a ziplock and squeeze the air out, but eventually bought a few tiny screw top plastic containers. Worth it.

I know it sounds like a weird thing to heal scarring and redness but I will swear by it. I slather that crap on my face like it's going out of style, sleep on it, and presto. Whatever "brightening" magic is in there has helped with marks. It's a very very gentle sort of way to work on marks without drying out or irritating skin. Just what worked for me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think that calling it anything different has any effect on what I'm doing. I've been consistently making healthier choices for a while now. I don't think that using a four letter word is going to make me go all self-destructive. A diet is a diet - the basic meaning of the word diet is simpler than what most people use it as. Dietitians create diet plans. You adopt a healthier or less healthy diet depending on environmental and emotional factors. Calling something a diet does not necessarily mean that it is an unhealthy crash diet or that it is a temporary change. A change in diet is a fundamental change in the nutrition that you are putting into your body. Some people adopt a vegan diet. Some people go Keto or Atkins or any number of diets. Yes, some people go on crash diets and follow weird rules and then gain it all back. That's exactly what I said I had done before, and wasn't doing this time. 

It's sort of rude to imply on someone's celebratory post that they're going to fail because they used the D word that you don't like. I do realize that this sub has a bit of a stigma surrounding the word diet, but is it impossible to be happy for someone without criticizing? Nowhere in my post did I say I was going to go back to my old diet after losing my weight. Why imply that? 

I don't mean to sound like a jerk, I'm just curious and yes, a little offended. It's not a "lifestyle change" for everyone. Personally, I love seeing when people make total overhauls and improve their lives, but calling what I'm doing a lifestyle change is laughable. Nothing else about my lifestyle changed. I'm still lazy and I don't drink quite enough water and I don't see anything or do anything THAT much differently. I just cut portions and got smart about numbers. I can use whichever term works for ME. Why imply that someone is going to fail because their terminology isn't what you would choose to use? 

Again, I don't mean to sound like a jerk. Just curious. Might be a good topic for discussion at one point - the de-stigmatization of the D word. I feel like the worlds of health foods and diet culture and fitness and popular diets have changed dramatically since even the mid-to-late-2000's, when everyone and their mother was on a fad "diet" and wondering why it wasn't working for them. I've always been fascinated with the cultural ideas behind diet and nutrition and how the internet (and with it, the influx of fitness and health bloggers) has changed that, with more easily available access to the simple truth - eat less, weight less.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yup. I had my first derm suggest BC. When I told him it made me crazy and physically ill because of a hormone problem, he said "have you tried all types?" I explained that both the shot and the pill gave me problems, even the little baby weak pill. He kept insisting I should keep trying pills, "at least one or two new ones a month" until I found one that worked. 

Uh? I thought I was in a derm's office, not my gyno. And even my gyno never tried to pull that crap on me. Also, trying more than one pill a month? Did this guy not understand BC? To be fair he was some ancient old white dude who was pretty sure the pill couldn't actually make people sick so who knows, lol  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey! I just updated my routine in my comment I just made, but my current formula for Curology looks like this: 8% Azelaic Acid, 1% Clindamycin, .25% Zinc Pyrithione. My last formulation had something else I can't remember as the third ingredient and only 4% Azelaic Acid, and I feel like that's the standard formulation that most new users get. It worked really well for me but my second one works even better. Waiting to hear back on my third formulation now. The process is really easy with adjusting it, even if you're not out of your stock yet, so don't be afraid to shoot them a message often and let them know any concerns or victories!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, SCA! 

So, I wanted to thank those of you who have posted about Curology on here before - somehow, I trust this sub more than a google search (go figure!) and since I didn't have insurance at the time, I worked out that Curology was more cost-efficient at the time than paying out of pocket to see a derm. 

I'm 25, had normal/slightly sensitive skin all through my high school years. I really didn't develop much acne until I turned 21 or so, and then it just snowballed. A few pimples now and then turned into red, angry clusters of bumps on my cheeks and chin, pimples that would pop easily and scar for months. I started developing cystic acne, just one or two at a time but bad enough that it hurt to talk if they were near my lower half of my face or hurt to use facial expressions if they were up top. I used to wear makeup almost every day, so I cut that out, but even after that, I continued to get worse. 

When I started Curology four months ago, my face looked like the picture on the left. I fully admit the before and after isn't the best because the first picture is flipped (technology is hard) and the pictures are in different lighting - the first taken at night with overhead lighting, the second in daylight. But either way - I mean, zoom in. There's a very clear difference. 

I am someone who is hypercritical of my appearance and my skin. It is a terrible habit and one I'm trying to break as I'm trying to actually care for my skin instead of just "fix" it. If it's healthy, it will do the right things. 

Curology is just one part of my updated routine. I dropped harsh face washes and pore strips. I never used to use toner or moisturize. I hardly washed my face every day and would layer on Benzoyl Peroxide or Salicylic Acid in hopes that one of them would make my face stop breaking out. It just made it worse, honestly, and I know that now. 

Here's what my old routine looks like compared to my new routine, thanks to SCA and a little side research:

1. Face wash. Went from scrubby Clean and Clear type stuff to CeraVe Foaming Cleanser. Honestly, I don't think I was sold for the first week or so. But at the end of that first week, my skin started calming down a bit so I kept it up. 

2. Toner. Went from No Toner to Thayer's Toner with Rose Petal. I think using something that smells nice (I love rose scents!) and was gentle on my skin kept me going because I felt like it was time to pamper my poor face. 

3. Treatment. Went from layers of BP or SA to Curology. I had noticed some change in my skin already when I switched cleansers, but WOW. Curology made a dramatic difference in my skin so so fast. The person who I was assigned to deal with is a little curt and sometimes seems robotic but both new formulations have been spot on. I have been to real in-office dorms before and been given a tube of Adapalene. When that didn't work, I had two derms scratch their heads and tell me to go on birth control despite telling them I have hormonal issues that keep me from using it. My Curology person tried one basic formulation, then when I addressed concerns a few weeks later, she reformulated it with a few tweaks and again, a dramatic difference. I'm betting my next one will be even better. I have total faith in this company so far and have heard amazing things about their customer service. 

4. Moisturizer. Went from... whatever was cheap and on hand, to Clinique. I have had good luck with Clinique being nice to my face in the past (the Superbalanced foundation or whatever it is used to be my HG for not killing my skin) so I was using the gel during summer, but just ran out and switched to the lotion for the drier months. Not 100% sold on it yet as it's a very different texture but my skin probably needs it. 

Also: I drink TONS of water now. And my skin feels so much different. I also just feel better in general. Go figure. This should have been an easy one but I'm either really stupid or really lazy, because it took getting to 25 to start drinking enough water. I also started changing my pillowcases more often and using dedicated face towels for drying and for rinsing off. 

I don't use Curology every day - maybe a few times a week. I don't even wash my face every day either, which I know sounds counterintuitive but has been working well for me. I don't think I realized before how sensitive my skin was. I sometimes just wipe it down with a warm wet washcloth in the morning and slap on moisturizer.

I have gone from someone who hated walking in public without makeup to someone who is comfortable going totally bare-faced or just putting on mascara. I still have a ways to go but the difference in my face is awesome. Honestly I'd almost forgotten how bumpy my cheeks were until I decided to check out Curology's B A feature. 

Thanks for the Curology referrals, product recs, and awesome community. You guys are the best.

<TEXT> Alright, so my fianc recently started playing Assassin's Creed: Black Flag over for like the ninth time since we recently moved and he rediscovered console gaming. He's predominately a PC gamer and spends a lot of time at his computer. Problem is, his current chair is a $20 target POS and needs a replacement. 

Two questions: 

1) can any of you get me a picture of the front of this chair? I snagged one of the back while he wasn't looking, but can't figure out the front. Can't find it online. I think you see the front just when you first walk up to it in the beginning, but I'm not 100% sure. 

2. What's a mid-range desk chair that might already have red accents that I can fix up a little? Not looking for anything over $150-200, since I'll have to put other work into customization. I know pretty much nothing about chairs but I figure you guys probably have an idea. 

The most important thing is the picture of the front. Chair stuff I can probably figure out but I don't know how else to get a picture of the front. I want to surprise him. I've been joking about getting him a new chair since his old one died out like two years ago. 

Help!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I painted 10YO B's fingernails a few weeks ago. We usually play "nail salon" with his sisters - 3 and 7 - and he usually just watches or aims a hairdryer at their nails. This time he wanted to take part, with glitter. And why not? 

Then two weeks later, DB had the kids alone for a weekend while MB was out. DB is an engineer and a funny guy and let his girls put his hair in hair ties and take pictures. He drew the line at lip gloss. 

I love seeing parents that are more open. My dad was always very liberal in that aspect - he was a pink fairy for Halloween one year, I'll spare you the gory details - and is a lover of Hello Kitty and pink. 

I hope my future kids don't get sucked in by that blue/pink divide.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> My uncle died. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-03 19:16:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My drug-addicted, homeless, thieving uncle died on October 29th. 

And here's the thing nobody wants to talk about: it's disgusting. 

I am old enough to remember who he was before the hard drugs. I am old enough to remember my Uncle Mike, a funny if a little troubled guy that was six years older than my mom, four years older than my other uncle. I remember being very young, he came to my grandparent's house for holidays and barbecues in those days, I'm pretty sure he actually had somewhere to live then. 

Then he stopped showing up. Mom told me a few months in that he was in jail. I don't remember what the first time was for, but it was the first of many. Theft, possession, loitering, resisting arrest. He wasn't a good man anymore. And the terrible thing is that it's not like the decks were stacked against him - he had a family that loved him very much and desperately wanted him to come home, to get better. He seemed like he wanted to, too, at least for a little while. 

My grandpa had this old fishing boat that my uncle stayed on for a while. He had this cat that he brought with him, simply named "Kitty", who was essentially feral but adored my uncle Mike. He stayed on that boat for months, and he was only allowed inside when my grandparents were home. For good reason. I think I only said hi to him once or twice. He was all but a stranger to me at that point, he'd been gone for years and my memories of him were mottled by stories of his latest arrests. 

And then he stole from them. He broke into my grandparent's house - my grandparents, who are a little secluded by choice and who just want the best for everyone around them, who let me live with them briefly when my mom was off her bipolar meds and kicking me out every other week, who would sneak a crisp twenty dollar bill into your hand because they just knew you needed it. He broke into their house and stole my grandma's jewelry - stuff that probably didn't net him much, it was all sentimental stuff, her wedding set from the 50's, some family jewelry. That kind of stuff. No diamonds or flashy jewels. Just enough gold for him to pawn off to get some drug money. And he was gone again. 

I saw him once or twice after that - one crossing the road in front of my mom and I's car, just weeks after he'd robbed my grandparents, in their neighborhood. We didn't know if he was casing the place or what. My grandma said they hadn't talked to him. She didn't want to press charges. My grandpa did - my previously gentle grandpa, who spent a lot of time in his room watching old westerns, who himself dealt with depression and the fight to get back to normal, to enjoying life, he wanted to go after Mike with the full extent of the law. Grandma stopped him. I wish she hadn't. Maybe if they'd locked him up again things would have changed. Probably not, though. 

The last time, several years ago. I was in my mom's car, again, passenger seat, texting someone before I went into my grandparent's house. We were parked right in front and he walked right out from behind the house and waved. I just looked back down at my phone. It was too soon after he'd stolen from them, I was old enough to understand that he wasn't going to change. 

Then I get a call last night, while I'm dealing with my own feelings about a police-involved shooting in my old neighborhood, while I'm trying to run a handful of events for a program I volunteer for, while I'm stressed about my job and trying to diet and planning my wedding. 

He overdosed, right on the beach. He always loved the beach. Couldn't stand to be away from it. No wonder he'd basically lived there for the last decade and a half. Lived and died there, right on the sand. 

And my grandparents, who tried to give their eldest son everything they could, one of whom tried to help him even when he'd stolen from them and betrayed their trust in the deepest of ways... my grandparents get to collect his body and his measly possessions. A final thud. It's not a surprise. 

I cried for three minutes. And then I told my fiance I wanted ice cream. So we went to the store, and we got ice cream, and we watched a movie. And we went to bed, and he left for work this morning. I have today off anyway. I feel like I should be miserable, like I should be crying or upset in any way. I'm not. I don't want to talk about it with family. I can't. I'm afraid it'll all come spilling out. I'm still mad at a dead guy. At least I don't have to be ashamed of him anymore.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> A woman was shot by police in my old neighborhood. So many people are outraged, but I am siding with police. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-02 22:12:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Yesterday a woman was shot by multiple officers at once in my old neighborhood. Hearing "police shooting" immediately riles people up lately, and for good reason - police brutality is a real problem in this country. She was struggling with Bipolar Disorder, something a handful of people in my own family have suffered through. But I don't blame police for what happened at all in this case and I can't talk to anyone about it. 

But this was different. The woman was driving erratically, they were attempting to pull her over and bring her into custody. She had already been in an accident earlier in this incident - there was significant damage to her car, airbags were deployed, she was weaving in and out of traffic on the wrong side of the road. 

Police maneuvered themselves in a way that they partially boxed in her car. They told her to get out.
Instead, she floored it and rammed into a cruiser with people near it. Officers were injured. Understandably, they opened fire. She died from her injuries at the hospital. 

She may have been having a major psychiatric episode, but so many people are saying this could have been handled "better". How? They attempted to pull her over peacefully even after she'd done a hit and run somewhere else. She instead tried to harm more people with her car. She had no regard for her own life or for those surrounding her. What were they supposed to do, keep saying "pretty please" until she stopped having an episode? And at what cost? They had to shoot her to keep her from injuring even more people. Bipolar or not, a threat to other human lives is a threat. Does she get a pass from endangering others because of her diagnosis? No. 

I'm not someone who stands on the "police know best" side of the line but this incident, in my home town, is rubbing me the wrong way. They hear "police shooting" and it's an explosion. What would you have done differently? What else could they have done? I can't even say anything. People are spitting vitriolic anti-cop crap on every post. But really. What was their other option? Let her continue hurting and possibly killing other people?  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-11-02 08:37:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> And it's still a disappointment. But hey, that's because I know my programming. I typically stay at a midnight kickoff until well after 5AM, then write for a few more hours the next day. I like to end Day One with 12k+, or whenever the little countdown on the word count calendar says "At this rate you will finish on November 5th". 

I know I do a ton the first day, then spend several days not wanting to write and also catching up with emails, errands, and NaNo messages (I'm an ML, though this year I've gotten a surprisingly low number of messages, which I'm okay with). 

I do this on and off until I put things off so badly that I have to write something like 15k in the last few days. I'm going to try not to do that this year, but I have no self control and I just got a new electric kettle, so I keep getting up to make tea or have a snack or check on one thing or another. 

Ideally I'd like to finish by the 15th - there's a name for it but I can't remember what it is. But that's what I want to try to do. I have a different work schedule this year where I work three ten-hour shifts a week, so with uninterrupted weekday time I might be able to get things done!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh awesome! We basically only checked out two venues before we checked out Bailey's, and both were just kind of... lacking the really natural feel, you know? We really like all the cabins on the property and we know we've got some extended family that will probably be staying in one of the two big VRBO rentals on the mountain, so if you've got any tips about those, let me know. How was the weather for your weekend? I'm totally paranoid that it's going to be too warm (anything over like 75 degrees I start whining about how I'm actually legitimately going to melt, I do not like hot weather) but the resort owners insist it's not bad in September. 

Would you mind PMing me your budget breakdown? We have different group sizes but I'm interested to see how it all breaks down for group meals so I can start doing the math.  

Congrats! Your pictures look beautiful!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It will be extremely difficult. You already know this. But think of how much harder it would be if you stayed miserable in this marriage. It's toxic. This is better for them. It allows you and your soon-to-be-ex to shape whatever life for your children that you want. You and your wife could get along fine in a few years. You could both be very happy without each other. It's much better for children to have HAPPY parents than parents that stick together out of some duty to "staying together for the kids." 

Side note: don't say a single negative thing about their mom until they're much older. Seriously. It seems like easy common sense stuff but it is actually really really hard. My parents split and then couldn't stop talking shit about each other for years. They still do. They're both much happier and healthier without each other. It's just petty and it doesn't endear your children to you when they start to understand the gravity of the situation. 

This is a healthy choice. It still sucks and feels awful but you'll look back and know you made the right move here. Just protect yourself and your kids and make sure they're supported and loved. But don't forget to take care of yourself, too. Eat. Sleep. Make sure you take some time to recharge and just breathe and keep yourself healthy. I wish you the best of luck.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Obviously you've already realized that you need to not leave the house for a while and that you need to lawyer up. I'd supplement with this: 

1. Make note of when the guy was at your house, that whole situation. You specifically asked her not to bring other men into your home and she tried to sneak behind your back and do it anyway. She brought someone you don't know into your home when you weren't home, endangering herself and possibly you/your family/your home in the process. 

2. Prepare for her to fight you on every little thing, because it sounds like she will. But as far as communications go, let her know that you'll continue to communicate day-to-day needs with her, but that anything surrounding the legal proceedings of your divorce will have to go through your lawyer. 

3. Keep your kids #1 in this - take a little extra time every day to remind them how much you love them and are there for them. A messy divorce is devastating to younger kids and they need to know they're your priority.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Wedding Weekend Brides (or just helpful people): What are your biggest tips/tricks/what do you wish you'd done differently? I'm planning my four day wedding weekend and panicking! </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hi! Title says most of it, but basically I am 10.5 months away from my wedding weekend and having a hard time finding balance. My FH and I always knew we wanted something that was more than just a single day rental, but now that it's actually booked, we're having a hard time figuring out how this whole thing will work. 

We have a decent budget ($30k). Our venue cost $6k for all four days plus lodging for 20 for all of that, plus help with day of coordination stuff from the owner's wife. Our photographer is $4.5k, which I know sounds steep BUT that includes the engagement session, and he's coming up for the whole weekend to get 4+ hours of rehearsal dinner coverage, 10+ hours day of the wedding, a few hours for a farewell brunch the next morning, and a really nice leather-bound album that he does an amazing job on. Altogether it's something like 20 hours total just of photography and COUNTLESS  hours of editing. And he shot my uncle's wedding so I know he does amazing work. Those were two of our most important things. The other is food. 

How the heck does this work? Our list is 90% family - parents and sibs, aunts/uncles/cousins. That's it. And maybe a dozen friends, most of which all know each other. We're getting married at a mountaintop "resort" - think rustic cabins, dirt roads, the property has been around since the late 19th century. It's a beautiful natural area with tons of cabins on property and a big main house with two kitchens. Each of the cabins have their own kitchen, at the very least a stove, oven, microwave, fridge, and some counter space. 

FH and I are thinking of doing it this way: 

Thursday: everyone drives up early afternoon. Lunch on the way up. We pick up a few half kegs from our favorite brewery on the way up. 
Dinner: potluck. Everyone brings an app/side/dessert to share and my stepdad barbecues. This is mostly just immediate family. 

Friday: remaining weekend guests arrive. Rehearsal dinner. 
Breakfast: we provide coffee, juice, and pastries. Anything extra people have to bring up for themselves. 
Lunch: everyone brings their own. Lots of people will arrive around lunch or later so it isn't really possible to plan this when I can't know when everyone will be arriving.
Dinner: we provide a catered dinner, BBQ or something easy. 

Saturday: wedding! 
Breakfast: we provide coffee, juice, and pastries. 
Lunch: everyone has their own. We're planning on making it a picnic-type thing on the big front lawn of the main house. 
Dinner: we cater reception dinner and desserts 

Sunday: goodbye! Checkout is noon. 
Brunch: we provide coffee, juice, pastries. Family provides eggs/bacon/pancake type stuff for the group. 

That's it! So really, immediate family is covering their lunches and potluck on Thursday. Family coming up Friday is just covering Saturday lunch. Does this seem reasonable? I feel like it is and people are telling me it is, but I feel bad inviting people for a full weekend and making them drag food up a mountain - though I guess this wedding IS very family reunion-esque, and people pay for their own food on vacations. I just want to at least offer to do a little easy breakfast kind of thing to get people out and together in the mornings. 

And what about things to do? I know the property is big and really pretty. I'm hoping we can rent a projector and a big screen and watch a movie on the lawn the night of the rehearsal dinner. I don't know. What's too much? I don't want everyone feeling bored but I don't want anything feeling rushed, either. 

What have I gotten myself into??  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi! As a fellow fair-skinned person with "separation anxiety, what finally worked for me was the method I set my makeup. I used to use a big fluffy brush to swipe powder on, then used a setting spray, and ended up with foundation separating within an hour. Ugh. I switched to this: Ester Lauder double wear foundation, let it sit a few minutes. Use RCMA no color powder and use a puff to press the powder into the skin. Add my blush/bronzer on top of that to keep things smooth, more patting motions instead of brushing. I use a brush but I do short lil patting presses instead of big long swipes, which disturbed my makeup. Then once it's all finished, MAC Fix +, then either UD all nighter or Skindinavia Bridal finish spray. 

My foundation never ever separates now. Also, I stopped exfoliating as much and went with a gentler skincare routine, which changed how oily I got. Better base makes for better makeup. I just use cera ve foaming cleanser, not even every day! And just water splashing other days. Thayer's rose petal toner then Clinique moisturizing gel. I had okay skin, acne prone and kind of bumpy, so I was SURE a simple routine wouldn't work for me. Instead, my skin has totally cleared up and my oil production is way way down.  </TEXT>

I was late coming out by like 20 minutes because I went to go get him beignets to surprise him. He told me he got really worried that something had happened to me because I was so late getting out, and then I showed up with food and coffee. He was like "that's when I... well, I guess what I'm trying to say is I love you too."  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have the best luck with Mac prep and prime under the EL foundation. I've also been setting my face differently (pressing with RCMA no color powder now, used to brush on Laura mercier) which made a HUGE difference in the appearance and longevity of my makeup. Recently I've been mixing in a little of either Maybelline Master Prime illuminating primer or the Cover FX enhancing drops - I use celestial - and I feel all glowy and not cakey at all. 

Also, I sort of switched up my technique with my blush/bronzer, I do more of a dabbing motion with my brush with short blending strokes instead of long sweeping strokes. I noticed my bronzer went on patchy when I used longer strokes because it stuck to all my bumps and textured areas.

<TITLE> Decadence AZ - Weather/stage/shuttle question </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-14 09:18:53 </DATE>

<TEXT> Hi, all! 

I've never been to Decadence before, or really any winter night time event. (I'm used to 100 degree EDC or indoor smaller venues for artist shows, there is no in between for me lol) 

What's the weather like in AZ around then? I've heard the stage is indoors, is this true? Is it super hot inside? I have no idea what to expect for this and what to wear. Also, has anyone done the package with them with the certain hotel where you get to ride a free shuttle? What's that like? Again, I'm used to EDC and the shitshow that is that shuttle system, so I'm betting it's better than LV but is it good enough to warrant booking that specific hotel? 

Fianc and I are going for our five year dating anniversary because this lineup is full of a bunch of our all-time favorites. Also we're old and we don't do anything for NYE most years anyway, so this was a good excuse, haha. Can't wait! :)  </TEXT>

They always picked one kid to "die" - usually someone well liked, not super popular, someone sweet and friendly. And they would go for a week or two like this. The kid couldn't tell their friends. The story was they were either driving while on their phone or with someone who was. One year I think they had a kid "die" because he got high with his friends and thought he was okay to drive. Brutal. But I'll be damned if it didn't at least make ME think twice.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I don't really want to have a discussion about numbers vs numbers, it's already making me uncomfortable just posting this, but due to a crazy family situation (both parents divorced and remarried, my grandmother basically raised me, FH and I are putting a big chunk of money into this) our budget is around $32k. It seems like an ungodly amount of money and it absolutely is. But as someone who previously claimed "I'll never spend more than $10k on a wedding", I was pleased to find that our family all really wanted to contribute (with the exception of my father, which... Ugh) and that we'd have a little more financial freedom. 

But either I let it get to my head or I severely underestimated the cost of a wedding. Probably a bit of both. We're getting married near Temecula, CA - just north of San Diego. It's an expensive area and vendors are mostly all pricey. We knew we wanted high quality food and photos, and our venue costs $6k because it's a full weekend rental (four days, with accommodations for 19 and tons of cabins on property for additional cost). After food, venue, and photographer, we're already at $17k. For less than a hundred people! Our food cost works out to $100 per person (again, we really wanted really nice food) 

I feel like my panic is amplified because I've never seen this much money in my life. Neither FH or I come from wealthy families - we're hard workers contributing $10k ourselves, and our four other contributors are pretty evenly split with the rest of the budget. My family was dirt poor growing up, and my mom has gone on to get a nice job and my grandma has had a few thousand saved up for this since I was little. FH's family is good about managing their money but not obscenely wealthy or anything. 

I mean, I could buy a nice car for this much money. It could be a decent down payment on a house. But our families are supportive of us having our dream wedding - only, every little tiny decision and tweak and adjustment can mean a couple thousand dollars shifting priorities. And as a bride who isn't used to money, there's a ton of pressure on me - admittedly, mostly my own worries about financial contributors not being happy with choices we make when they're giving us so much. The only person I have really heard any negative feedback from has been my FMIL (that's a whole other story) but I'm stressed out anyway. FH and I have a fairly specific vision for our wedding, fairly non-traditional and a little eclectic. I know not everyone has to love every aspect. Doesn't change the pressure on every decision. 

And EVERYONE feels like they want to be involved. With everything. FH thinks his mom isn't involved enough, but she was with us when we picked out venue and she paid the deposit (even after I asked her not to). We haven't done much else. I explained it to him like this: we're allowed to bring three people with us to our catering tasting. Three. Guess how many people have said they want to go?  Nine. Obviously, everyone can't be part of everything. 

I'm about ready to tell everyone to keep their money and let us elope. As much as I'm grateful for the help, when it comes with this kind of pressure attached, it's also a burden. 

I know this sounds like a spoiled, entitled rant. But I don't want it to. I'm not used to this much money. I could never handle being rich. Ugh.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to agree with the general consensus here - give her a brow product. But I'm going to suggest powder instead of a pencil - pencil can take several tries to get used to and the creamier formulas settle into the fine lines on some older ladies I know. A soft, neutral powder is easy to brush on and doesn't require too much blending. 

Also, because she wears glasses, I suggest a fun liner (I like the blue! Maybe green?) or a fun, sheer lip color. Anything too opaque, again, settles really easily and is more obvious. Something more sheer is easier to apply but can build up a little if desired. someone here suggested the UD Vice lipsticks - they have tons of sheer finish shades (my favorite right now is Sheer Ladyflower!) so that she can have a bright pop of color with minimal effort. 

Agreed with cream blush too.  </TEXT>

Now we are on the 9th (9/9!) but I had to tell you what my cute ass fianc did. We were standing in the kitchen the day before our One Year to Go and he's like "we should go out tomorrow" and I'm like "why??" Because I am dumb and also the worst. So he says "because tomorrow is 9/9. One year to go. It's like an anniversary but backwards. It's like..." 

And then like a moment from a really dumb movie or something, we look at each other and we're like "it's like a reverse anniversary. A Reversary." Which is some super gross shit we do all the time. Ew. 

So go, friends! Celebrate your Reversary with a date or beer or pizza or whatever works. Enjoy!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very rarely do I drag myself down to the point of calling a minor an asshole, but wow. What an absolute dick move. I'm not going to shame you guys like some other commenters, that's pointless, but I'm going to weigh in all the same.

As someone who used to trade "that's not mine!" Or "it's not my fault!" Punishments with my sister in a similar matter, and whose parents didn't do shit about it, I'm urging you to make a quick and significant gesture to your younger son. 

Older kid, in my opinion, gets this: twice the amount of time grounded. Minimum. Phone taken away. If you absolutely need to get a hold of him, buy him one of those dorky little kids phones where he can only call the numbers you program in. Maybe a sparkly pink or purple one. Any major electronics and events for the next several months are no longer his. 

The thing that got me most was that he was acting disappointed in his brother, then laughed the whole thing off. 14 is too young for that to happen to a kid and not really, really hurt. 

Younger son? He is gonna need a really, really nice new present. And you know what? It's not really all your fault that the grounding happened, though it's certainly some of it. Personally, I'd help younger kid get something cool. Laptop? Camera? Xbox? I don't know what the kids are into these days. But don't just pay for it yourself and ground the older kid. Find a family friend or a local business that's willing to hire older kid part time. He can start his first day of "work" the day you take younger kid to get his gift. Take the kid to lunch wherever he wants, get ice cream, whatever. Tell older kid that he is going to give 100% of his pay checks towards paying for little brother's present until it is paid in full, and then towards paying for his own outpatient rehab and/or therapy. Your kid has some issues if he's willing to go MONTHS of watching his younger sibling suffer, plus adding to that suffering by pretending to be so disappointed in the younger brother. He hid that box under brother's bed for a reason - he WANTED him to get in trouble. He knew this might eventually happen and decided he'd rather watch his younger sibling suffer than accept punishment for his own shortcomings. 

Lastly, I am so sorry this is happening to you. I cannot imagine being in this position as a parent. I was a hellion myself as a teenager, though I wasn't mixed up with drugs or alcohol at that age. I was just an asshole. Being older grants me the gift of retrospect, which makes me a little embarrassed for myself. Hopefully older kid will be too, eventually. You were right to jump to a strict punishment for weed like that, especially so since you believed it was a 14 year old's, but failing to take into consideration that it could have been someone else's (and not having proof that it was younger kids) was a slip up that you know you'll have to work through.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My dad and I were really close growing up. My mom was/is mentally unstable and not easy to be around. She's better now, but I was much closer with my dad when I was younger. He has his fair share of problems, I'll get to that in a sec. When he and my mom finally divorced five years ago, he almost immediately moved two hours away, married a new woman with two daughters just like my sister and I, and stopped trying to have a relationship with me or my sister. We'd do the obligatory Christmas visit and stuff, and for a while we went out there fairly often, but he just stopped trying. After several years, I stopped too - it's exhausting being in college and working and trying to keep up any semblance of a social life, let alone chasing after a relationship with a father who doesn't give a shit. 

My dad is a pathological liar. He's a horrible communicator and he's said awful things about me, my mom, and my sister for several years now - like my mom is brainwashing us to hate him, that we never call him (phone goes both ways!) and that we don't ever come see him. Uh. We chase after him to make plans. He always says he'll call or text and doesn't. He threw a fit on Christmas Eve because for the last three years or so I had gone to his house, but this last year he never invited us over or even asked if we'd be there, so we had to split the night with my fiance's dad's family. We still drove two fucking hours out there on Christmas Eve because we wanted to see him. But he was all pouty and that doesn't count because we should have just KNOWN we were invited and just shown up. Uh. 

He also gave me money once when money was tight for me. Less than a thousand dollars. Insisted that I never pay him back. That it was a gift, that he was glad to help. Then a year later called, after he quit yet another job, to ask when I was paying him back that money. I reminded him it had been a gift, but that if he really needed money I could afford to give him less than $100 a month. I have medical bills to pay and rent and bills. He just stopped answering me after that. He called back a few months later like nothing was wrong, and I found out that that's only because my fianc secretly drove two hours out of his way, took a half day off work, went to my dads house (coincidentally on my dads birthday a few years ago, the selfish hack probably thought my fianc was bringing him a present) and wrote my dad a check for the money back, and told him to quit treating me like crap over money. (I do love my fianc dearly, but had he mentioned this to me before doing it, I would have told him not to waste his time/money, that it wouldn't last long.) sure enough, a few months later, he stopped inviting us over again. But he still acted friendly most of the time. 

Basically, I was the mediator. Mom needed paperwork signed? I told him to call her. Sister hadn't seen him in a while? I called him to make dinner plans. He's driven out here all of three times to see us. Just in the first year after he left, we drove out there probably fifteen or twenty times. So in February, I had my engagement party. He showed up! And the next weekend, he helped me move! 

And then I didn't hear from him until June, when I texted him for Father's Day (I was out of town anyway so couldn't have made plans if I wanted to) and he swore he'd call me back to make plans when he knew they were free. Nope. 

So since February I haven't seen him at all and have only texted once for about ten minutes. 

I felt like I'd finally given up. That I was done chasing after a relationship with my father if he didn't give a shit about me. I don't really believe that he doesn't care about me at all, but he's a selfish, immature little brat. 

I recognize that my description of him is really shitty. He's done some really shitty things. But I do still love him and I know he's not all bad, just very very immature. I have made sure not to make plans on his birthday just in case he decides to invite us over for whatever he's planning this year. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to buckle and be the facilitator again. But I don't want to just stop talking to my dad entirely because he's being fucking stupid. I haven't talked to him too much about it because I don't want to ruin anything when we do actually see him. I'm getting married. He's definitely not walking me down the aisle but I also do want him there. 

Anybody have any ideas for breaching the accidental NC barrier and the topic of communication while still putting the ball in his court? I can't keep chasing and chasing. It's exhausting. 

Tl;dr lesser of two evils but still immature turnip NDad has drifted out of my life and I sort of want to contact him or see him around his birthday but also maybe not  </TEXT>

<TEXT> On mobile and can't quote, but... 

"He just thinks that because she wasn't thinking maliciously, I shouldn't be pissed off." 

This is the kind of behavior my FH was guilty of until we started managing it in therapy. He would claim that his mother had good intentions, so why was I upset? Ever heard that saying, "the road to hell is paved with good intentions?" Sort of applies here. Even if his mommy dearest was only suggesting this second wedding (that you offered before and she shut down) because her siblings are old and don't want to travel, she's missing the point of how much stress that puts on you and FH. If she wants this second event, after she told you no the first time, she can plan it and pay for it herself. 

Now, my FMIL is also a cracker eating quack, but not evil. I am well-versed in the ways of not wanting things to blow up but needing to be firm. 

Talk to FH, and with his permission, send an email from the BOTH of you stating that since you offered before and she seemed to not want two events, you planned and budgeted for only one event, and that that's where the money is going. It's already committed. Let her know that if she and her family don't attend that, that in a few months after the wedding, when everything is settled, she can host a party to get her family together to celebrate the wedding they missed. But that you'll be planning for the wedding that you thought everyone wanted, and the second party is up to her. 

Same with the future infant. No way in hell are you dragging a baby on a plane full of germs several times a year. When that comes around, offer to help pay for her airfare to come visit you as a present. Reasonable accommodations.

<TEXT> Firstly - listen to the voicemail. It sounds unlikely, but your mom could have had a change of heart. 

If that's not the case, you need to be firm with her - their divorce happened almost two decades ago. Dad's girlfriend is family now too, she's been around for a long time, it's not fair to tell her she can't come when she's been so inviting and welcoming to you for so long. You want her there. That's that. 

And more than that, tell her that what she's doing is effectively making you choose between inviting your mom or your dad to your wedding and leaving the other one out. Tell her that that's completely unfair of her, and that her asking you to do that on the most important day of your life is frustrating and hurtful. She needs to know that you are NOT going to be making that decision. You're inviting all parties because all parties deserve to be invited. If she chooses not to come, that's on her. Offer to make reasonable accommodations - she can sit on the opposite side of the room, they won't have to talk to each other, whatever. But you're not going to choose. 

My fianc and I both have divorced and remarried parents. My stepmom is a bit of a handful and my dad is a pathological liar so naturally we've had drama with my stepmom refusing to be cordial with my mom before she's even met her. They met (and they got along fine) because I gave all parties a stern warning - get along and behave, or everyone can be escorted out. Ended up fine. 

You are in charge here. Not them. Your dad and his girlfriend have done nothing wrong, and the fact that he was willing to have that conversation and uninvite the girlfriend the first time shows he's more committed to trying than your mom. If she can't suck it up for a day, her loss. Harsh, maybe, but don't let her force you into making that decision. 

ETA: How are they going to handle things when you have kids, if that's in your plan? Having little people in the mix can change any routines you've had for the last several years. You can split holidays sure, what about birthdays? Graduations? This problem will persist unless you stop it now.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My 3YO crazy person had the best response to a guy cutting us off on a totally empty street. She wasn't quite three when this happened. 

"I'm gonna hit him! I'm gonna get a hockey stick and I'm gonna hit him and hit him and hit him until he's dead! Then I'm gonna bury his body in the ground and wait a long time, and when it's done, an apple tree is going to grow there! Then I'll have a snack!" 

I thought THAT was weird, until we got home and I was telling the story to DB. 3YO, sitting on the floor between us, hears me say "some jerk cut us off" and she says "Yeah! F*ckin' Asshole!" 

I was like "wait, she didn't get that from me..." And that's how I learned that "Daddy says bad words sometimes and 3YO is a parrot" 

We were also at Target once after Christmas, each kid checking out their ONE thing separately because they had their own money. It's not busy but this lady behind us is complaining like we're taking an hour in the only open lane. 

3YO, who is sitting in the cart,  hears her say "these kids are taking forever" and leans around me, looks at the lady, and says "Hey! F*ck you!" 

I try to stammer out an apology but I can't manage it and the lady just says "oh, okay, it's fine" and doesn't say another word.  </TEXT>

I already ate fairly healthy some of the time but I would binge all the time. I haven't binged in over three weeks. I had a tendency before this to try and jump straight into strict calorie counting and working out five times a week and I'd burn out in days.

<TEXT> Hey, all! 

Reposting some things I posted several months ago. I am getting married in a little less than a year (woo!) and also I just have way too much stuff at this point. 

If there are things in the verification album that aren't on this list, they're gone - that includes the entirety of the ColourPop lot. It's all sold. I'm just on an app right now waiting for a doctor's appointment and can't edit the imgur thing for some reason. 

Minimum purchase of $10 before shipping.

Shipping starts at $3 and increases with weight/number of items. Tracking will be provided as soon as I can ship. I ship within 48 hours of the time I receive payment. If you'd like rush shipping, let me know. I ship using bubble mailers and I wrap all items in at least one more layer of bubble wrap, two if the item is a little more fragile. If you'd like another method of shipping, feel free to ask - I can send a flat rate mailer and pack it with bubble wrap also for an additional fee.

Failure to pay within 24 hours will mean I release product back into sale. PayPal gift only, please. 

Most importantly - *MAKE ME AN OFFER!* None of these prices are concrete. I lowered almost everything this time around, but I'm willing to go even lower. 

All items marked FWP are also eligible to be, you guessed it, free with purchase. One FWP item per $20, please.

<TEXT> Sort of depends on circumstances, doesn't it?

Also, I'm disabled. So yeah, my fianc does the big work (he offered!) and I make up for it in other ways around the house. He asks nicely for me to pick up the random crap I leave around.

<TEXT> Okay, playing Devil's Advocate because I'm a lot like your SO. I am chronically messy. My fianc is a neat freak. It took several years for us to find our groove with living together, but it finally boiled down to this - My SO could ask in a perfectly reasonable way for me to clean up. But because it's always been an issue before, I felt attacked or blamed. That made me just not want to do it. Fight starts. Repeat. 

I told him "just remind me nicely!" And he would say he would, but his reminders were usually frustrated before he even got a chance to mention it to me, so sometimes it came out a little clipped or blunt and, go figure, I didn't like that. Sometimes it's a little tone change. I fully admit that I'm sensitive about that kind of thing, and maybe your SO is. Or maybe not. 

Here's how we worked it out - my SO does a majority of the big chores - laundry and dishes and vacuuming. Stuff like that. But twice weekly, he's supposed to say a *scripted* line - "Hey, can we spend ten minutes picking up the apartment tonight?" 

That takes away any potential for being offended. It makes it a team effort. But it also makes it about accountability and working WITH your partner instead of a "my stuff/your stuff" argument. 

My fianc grew up in a neat and tidy house and doesn't own a ton of junk. I grew up in a disgustingly messy house - mold, mice, the whole deal. I used to get screamed at to do chores that weren't mine to do, or in the middle of the night. It took a long time to realize that it was really just a difference in upbringing, standards of living, and also me being a little sensitive. It takes a long time to break the habit of just being messy. Be patient, but absolutely tell him that you need to work together to fix this.

<TEXT> Okay, as a fellow Chronically Ill Person, I am begging you to dump this jerk before you make the mistake of serious commitment. 

Here's how a partner SHOULD react to hearing their SO had a diagnosis like this. 

1. Ask questions. 
2. Be supportive. 
3. Come with you to appointments when possible. 
4. Make sure you're taking care of yourself. 
5. Be an advocate for you and your care. 
6. Not do any of the things your SO just did. 

My fianc was incredibly supportive and helpful from the get go. I offered him an "out" - he didn't sign up to be with a sick person, I didn't want him to feel guilty and stick around out of that guilt. He told me I was being crazy, of course he'd stay with me, and he wanted to know as much as possible. He has gone to appointments with me, held my hand and rubbed my face the ER, brought me pain meds and ice packs and heating pads and a stiff drink. 

A partner should be supportive through ALL things in your life. If this dude is crying wolf and being this much of an ass during a big challenge in your life, he's going to keep doing this. When you talk about getting married. When you have kids, if that's your thing. 

Call his bluff. Tell him you refuse to admit to something that you did not do, that if he's that scared of your diagnosis he can stay gone. You'll figure out the truth really quick - this dude is either cheating on you or he's a total coward.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My problem before was accountability. If I really didn't care about my weight, I would be cooking chicken piccata and unhealthy stuff for every meal, I'm a decent cook. I would eat healthy but binge every other weekend or so and feel like crap. And I also mentioned that I was potentially not eating enough, which is a problem for a few health issues I have. I just needed to find a system that had a good reputation. I do meetings with my mom too, so that's half my accountability right there.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I was just trying to fill points at the end of the day. I wanted the wine anyway but I might have had half as much if I wasn't trying to meet the minimum. And as for breakfast, it's big! It's two jumbo egg white veggie muffins. I'm totally satisfied through lunch, or I might have a couple pieces of low sodium turkey for a snack. I think my problem is that I've been eating so low carb/high veggie/high lean protein for so long that I'm having trouble justifying adding high point items just to meet a quota. I basically worked out what I used to eat and I was eating about 1100-1400 calories depending on the day, but some of those days were only 15 points! I think my other thing is healthy fats. I was definitely not eating enough of those. Maybe adding some salmon and avocado and stuff into the mix will help.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Smart Points "Healthy Range" - what does it mean? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-21 06:50:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Sorry if this is something obvious that I'm missing, I'm just starting out and just a bit confused about a few things. 

I'm supposed to get 33 points per week. Great! There's that "Healthy Range" calendar at the bottom of the app that states that my range is between 30 and 40 points per day. I'm trying to stick exactly to the plan, so I'm eating within that range. But as someone who has already been eating really healthy for several months before starting WW, I'm finding it hard to reach that 33 points! I weigh my food out to the gram, I've been liberal with things that might help me use up my points, but I had to have basically a fourth big meal at the end of the day for the last few days because I was only at 19 points. I know this is kind of a silly problem to have, but I'm concerned about what those points mean, calorie-wise, and how eating all this food is going to be beneficial to my weight loss. I'm having to eat twice as much to reach my points as I was eating before WW. 

Am I missing something? Is it that big of a deal if I don't meet 30 points per day? I'm assuming plenty of people go under their points range but it has been a concern for me before that when I decide to buckle down and eat healthy, I'm not eating enough. So I'm trying to meet my range, but I'm feeling like it's too much food. 

For example, here's my intake for today: 

Breakfast: 
Egg and veggie muffin (2) 
Fruit Cup (0)

Lunch: 
Chicken (1)
Chickpeas (2) 
Ranch (1) 
Millet (1) 

Dinner: 
Veggie "Lasagna" (6) 
White Wine (6) 

Fourth Meal: 
Almond milk (1) and cereal (4) 
Veggie "Lasagna" (6) 

That's 30 points. Calorie-wise, it looks... Okay? But I felt so full most of the day. And as you can tell, I had to eat ELEVEN points at the end of the night. 

Is there something I'm missing? Is it okay to be that far under at the end of the day?

<TEXT> What is a hyperconservative male (another thing I see from your post history) even doing on this sub? Oh, right, you got linked here from a post complaining about this post. So you decided to waltz right in and accuse me of encouraging rape? What the actual fuck is wrong with you? This is a place that has (until you) been a supportive, light-hearted conversation about consent with sexual partners. Nowhere in here did anyone say "gee I wish some neckbeard would fly in and tell me I'm propagating rape culture because I wanted my partner to also give consent" 

What is wrong with you 

In no way have you been kind at all in this conversation. I don't owe you any kind of "explanation" for an anecdote I told online in a FEMALE-CENTRIC sub in a thread about support and consent. 

You wanted to make assumptions about me from my post history, I made a few about you. How about the one thing you didn't find in my post history? I am the survivor of a brutal sexual assault that left me with cracked vertebrae and a concussion. There is not a single cell in my body that would ever encourage rape or rape culture. You took a simple string of words in a post that had **nothing to do with you** and twisted them into something incredibly fucked up, just so you could go giggle back with your fellow neckbeards on SRSsucks. 

This is exactly time for ad hominem. You come to a female-centric sub and insult someone you yourself stated is a liberal feminist, insinuating that the person actually doesn't know what they're talking about and is encouraging rape. Uh. Please go lock yourself back in your basement somewhere and come back when you've thought that one out a bit more.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You've done what you can for now. The hiring process for Disneyland is notoriously slow at times. Because you applied in the middle of summer Peak season, they already had most of their seasonal cast members and likely didn't need to hire any new people for a while. When I applied I got lucky, I applied one night, got a call the next morning, went for an interview a few days later, and got hired on the spot. But a few of the friends I worked with had been applying over and over for several months. It depends on where they need people. They needed attractions cast at the time, so I got on quick. 

If it's in progress, they're looking through it. They'll get to you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Purging is what we call the reaction some people have to certain new chemicals or treatments - basically, things that are a little stronger. Some people have a period where they have worse symptoms (usually worse acne) for up to a few months after they start the new product. So for example, some people who use Curology "purge" for two months or so when they first start using it, then their acne really clears up. I got lucky and my acne didn't get worse before it got better.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a really negative view of mental illnesses, and it would be a good idea for you to maybe educate yourself or consider context instead of passing judgement on someone you don't know. They never said that the state wouldn't give them a license, just that it was difficult for them to obtain one. Big difference. 

I didn't get my license until I was almost 21. I have fairly terrible anxiety issues which are great for nannying sometimes (I am always prepared for every possible problem and I'm hyper vigilant) but was not great for learning to drive a very heavy, very big, very dangerous vehicle for the first time. 

I am excellent with kids, my mom ran a daycare growing up, I have been a nanny for several years and babysat for several more before that. But driving a car was terrifying at first. It's a whole different ball game.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> August has been a crazy month for our schedule - both I and the family were on different vacations for a week at the beginning of the month. I came back for a week and a half, I'm here today and Friday, then I'm gone for another week on a family vacation. Mom boss graciously offered to hire a one off, week long replacement so my fianc and I could go the whole week! Which is awesome. And then the day after I come back, the kids start school again, and thus ends their summer break and lets us go back to normal schedule - big kids in school during the day, I just have all three before and after school and toddler during the day. It's a great recipe for missing the last week of summer, which is usually full of too much energy and crazies. 

But all three kids have been freaking terrors for the last few days. They were crazy all last week when I was back, they've been crazy this week, and I'm sure they'll lay it on thick for this afternoon and Friday. 

I'm bribing them with a slurpee if they can keep it under control for a while, but who knows. 

The big guy, who is nine, has such an attitude today. And all days. He's old enough to know his behavior is crappy but he continues. It's infuriating. He's got some undiagnosed anger issues that he's seeing a therapist for and he likes to blame everything on that. He'll hit his sister over something stupid and say "I can't help it! It's my anger problem!" He's often rude and sometimes outright cruel to his little sisters and i am so done with it.  </TEXT>

All of our party crowd is staying on property for obvious reasons ;) 

That's awesome! My family has been fairly helpful too and luckily a pocket of our family lives sort of in the area and has lots of good connections - so we'll be lucky when it comes time to find a caterer and stuff like that. I almost lived just outside London, but I ended up staying stateside because I was just starting to date this guy, and it looked like things were going really well.

I've been finding that like half of the photographers I've been talking to are including engagement shoots. The one I'm probably booking does it, the other two I was talking to did also. 

Totally know what you mean with window shopping. Too much fun stuff to look at!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I figured I would start one! And it seems like it's predominately mountains and outdoors, which is awesome. 

We don't have a ton of friends (lol) and our closest friends are like... A couple that got married eight years ago in another state and a bunch of singles. But my uncle just got married in March and my new aunt who I adore has been super helpful and basically offered a bunch of her decor stuff to us (really nice stuff we'll totally use) plus their photographer is a family friend who is going to give us a good deal and does amazing work. And that uncle is going to be our officiant. So I guess we have a liiiiittle more planned than just our venue. 

Dress shopping is the thing I'm most nervous about. 

CA is a great state! Born and raised here and I only get the urge to move about once a year :P but it's so diverse, in terms of sights to see, and we love it. Come honeymoon out here! Lots of wine, breweries, forests, great camping and B and Bs, all kinds of stuff.

<TEXT> Yep! Surprise! I'm your twin! Lol. We wanted to rent out a camp but we couldn't find one close enough that we really liked! The place we booked basically feels like a camp though - there's a big main house that sleeps 19, a dozen or so cabins and tent cabins, ten tent camping spots, and like acres of land. It's so beautiful and it is secluded and exactly what we wanted. 

I can't imagine planning a wedding from a different country. As it is, mine is 3 hours away and I have to plan a full weekend day or a weekend to go meet with vendors and stuff. Still worth it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand what the downvote button is for. She's literally just saying "that shape looks good on you, you should do more of that". It's not a wardrobe critique. It's an appreciation of a piece of clothing and an idea about how else it could be used. They were discussing the different forms of that top. 

I've seen people all over this sub comment about hair and jewelry and tops and dresses all the time. Part of talking about makeup is talking about how it plays up the other parts of our outfits or accessories. "This goes great with that!" Is common. -15 net votes is not warranted for a comment about a shirt. It happens here every day.

<TEXT> Nice! Yeah we need to get engagement pics done. Or at least something for the website/STDs or something. Even though we've been engaged for seven months. Oops! 

I actually tried on dresses once a few months ago. Im going to start really looking again because I know it's going to take me forever, but I actually really liked one of the first ones I tried on. I have a super hourglass figure with unfortunately wide hips compared to my waist and broad shoulders/big chest so dresses are proving difficult unless they're a corset/ball gown/a line type thing, which I'm not really into.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> September 2017 people! How is your planning going? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-11 19:17:48 </DATE>

<TEXT> Hi! FH and I got engaged in December 2015, on our four year dating anniversary. We knew right away that there was a specific feel and structure we wanted for our wedding. We're both outdoorsy and life time scouts, we didn't want to spend a bunch of money on an eight hour event so we wanted a full weekend kind of deal, hopefully in the mountains, where we could spend quality time with friends and family. It took us several months to find our place, but we finally booked our venue a week and a half ago, so we finally have our date! September 9th, 2017. Woo! 

We live just south of Los Angeles and have a very non-traditional family structure (both sets of parents divorced and remarried, lots of siblings and step siblings, lots of nieces and nephews, some adoptive family, not a lot of friends) so we knew from the beginning that we didn't want anything traditional. Nobody who is contributing financially is contributing towards any specific thing. We're grateful for any contributions but not demanding anything. My fianc [28M] and I [25F] have lived together for almost our entire relationship. He's involved in planning. We're very detail oriented and we know what we want, so having four sets of parents with very different opinions is difficult, to say the least. 

But we have our venue booked! And a date! A few days short of 13 months out. We're excited to really get to planning! But we have zero other choices made, really. I know my bridesmaids. 

Where is everyone else at in planning?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay I am having a similar problem with bridesmaids. I asked all of my sisters and stepsisters (I have 5 total) to be bridesmaids, plus my two closest friends. My wedding is only going to have like 65 people, lol. 7+7 for a bridal party for a wedding that small is... Unwieldy. 

So I'm not asking anyone to step down or anything. They're all technically still bridesmaids and still a part of the day. But the sisters I'm not as close with will be sitting, not standing. this won't come as a shock to them. My standing crowd will be my bio sister, my youngest step, my oldest guy friend, and my best friend of 6 years. The other two steps will be sitting and my FSIL will be on FH's side as they're fairly close. Bingo. Extended party but only a few standing. They'll still wear coordinating dresses (we're going mismatched but cohesive) but not stand. Easy. 

My future MIL had lots to say about the size of my bridal party. This seemed like a good compromise and she hasn't said anything about it since then.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> All of those lines sound pretty much perfect. And you're very right about being a team and setting boundaries. I think it's a more straightforward conversation than FH wants to have about his mom and her involvement but he's going to have to deal with it if he doesn't want me to be a grumpy jerk for the next year.

And you're also right about what's big stuff and what's little stuff. I think setting the boundaries clearly and nice and early will help with the little stuff, too. We just need to be more firm. And I need to be more firm with FH too and let him know that I won't allow him to drag his feet on all of this because it affects me more than it affects him. I think he's just underestimating what these things mean so far. I told him his mom wanted the guest list and my mom wanted a room list (less than 12 hours after we last saw them!) and he was like "so what? just send her the list?" and insisted that he didn't think she'd want to make any changes. I literally sent him the text about her "tweaking" it and he was like "Oh, well she probably just wants to check it, not tweak it." He has a hard time believing she's ever in the wrong and he misses all of the snarky comments she makes towards me so it's hard because I am not going to let her "win" this. But I'm also not willing to be a doormat and just let everyone trample me. He's going to have to get on board, and maybe with a stronger explanation, he'll get it. 

Thanks for also admitting I'm being neurotic. I feel like a total fucking basket case right now. Must. Set. Boundaries. Big ones. With FH fully on board. Thank you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for the advice. I've already tried the 'Thanks, but' line with planning and it hasn't obviously gone so well as it's only gotten worse, but I think I have a way to handle that now. You made a good point about letting people know or just not doing that. We're busy people so after an initial meeting saying "hey, we need your help with X Y Z and thats it" we can say "oh! We already made that decision and it's done and paid for!" 

Second person to tell me vendors have already had to deal with this stuff all the time. Feels good. I keep mistakenly thinking that they're not used to crazy parents.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks. I know the money thing is actually the smallest problem - I don't really think that any of the parties except for my dad are giving really super conditional financial contributions, I just know they'll whine about it. I care less about the whining and complaining than I do about that initial meeting, which actually sounds like a good idea. Less confrontational in a way than just sending an email or text out of the blue. FH and I can sort of have our "script" of things we are going to say, letting them know how things will go and what exact things we want their help on, focusing on the positive. I know there will be grumbling. I'm just not looking forward to saying it to their faces and I know I have a tendency to be a more than a little blunt, and I don't want to set off any alarms with them. I just need to find a way to make it as non-offensive as possible while also telling them they can take their ideas and shove them where the sun don't shine. 

FH and I are in counseling already for something else, but I didn't even think about using that tool to work through the parents issue. I have a hard time telling him "your mom is overstepping her boundaries" because in a more traditional family, which part of his is, that's all normal behavior. Parents get to tweak guest lists and make big decisions and the couple just has to deal with it. I am not part of that school of thought so it's going to be a little shocking to them, which I'm dreading, but I am not letting this go down like this. I'll probably even suggest that FH has to be the one to do most of the talking at that meeting, because she'll listen to him more than she'll listen to me. (She's given almost imperceptible hints during the last four years that she doesn't really like me, never when other people are around. I have only ever been nice to her and I've done everything I can to not let her bad attitude affect his relationship with her)

I just texted FH and told him that I'm having reservations about the way our mothers expect to be involved with planning and that there will need to be changes. He texted back with a little resistance and a sort of sarcastic comment, and I let him know that I will not let one person's financial contribution dictate the way our wedding goes. And that if she insists that we go her way or the highway, I would willingly choose the highway and elope rather than take money and make it go towards a wedding I don't agree with. He turned around quick. We're going to discuss our options tonight and come up with specific things that we *really, really* need our moms help on that are enough that they feel they're needed but small enough that I don't care if they royally screw up. 

Good call on parents not meeting vendors anymore. And good call on contacting the venue owner. I sometimes get this wild idea in my head that my family is so fucked up that I can't tell other people things because they'll think I'm weird. I had this idea that they owner would think I was a total bridezilla control freak already if I sent him this. Now that you mention it I'm sure he's probably had to deal with many overbearing parents. I'll send that out today before it's too late. 

Also good call on the guest lists spots. The only one concerned with the guest list is FMIL so maybe when I send her the list, because I know I'll have to at some point, I can put in a little note that, hey, surprise, we have a tiny bit of wiggle room and that if there are four people she'd like to invite, we have room for that, but no more. 

alsjkflasdjlkasjlfakjsdlf Thank you for your advice. I'll keep all of that in mind while formulating a plan.  </TEXT>

I realized later on that three of the eight I saved were from the same place. We took a look at two other venues way back in January, but didn't fall in love with either of them. We knew we had to see this place, and we got crazy busy in spring and summer this year, so it took us months to get out and see it. Just do a search for "wedding" + "your area" + "woodsy/outdoors/camp/whatever keywords you want" and look specifically for posts from wedding blogs - we loved Green Wedding Shoes!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, I'm a minor league poster over at r/weddings. FH is 28, I'm 25F, we've been together almost five years already and are doing okay financially. We're both smart, detail-oriented, and laid-back. But wedding planning is starting to make my neurotic - not because the actual planning is stressful, but because we have four sets of divorced and remarried parents to contend with, all of whom have different ideas of what we should or shouldn't do with our wedding. I feel like I'm crying out of nowhere all the time and I am usually a strong-willed person but I'm so anxious and I don't know how to do this right. I've had some issues with FH and I's four sets of parents that I've posted about on r/weddings and I'll summarize here: 

My mom + her boyfriend: Mom and I did NOT get along well until well after I moved out of her house. Mom is borderline unstable and a raging narcissist. She's gotten MUCH better in the almost five years I've been out of the house, and her boyfriend helps her chill out, but she's still a pain at the best of times. Everything is about her all the time, and if she's not front and center, she's throwing a fit about it. She has already made me feel bad because she thought SHE would be walking me down the aisle in lieu of my father doing so. This is the woman who threw me out of the house upwards of twenty times during my teenage years for as little as not doing the dishes one day. I told her my sister would have that honor (I've told her this before but she conveniently forgot) and she actually thought she would be the one to do it. Nope. I won't get into details but I don't want to be 'given away' by a woman who basically disowned me multiple times and was physically and emotionally abusive for years. She's better now but that doesn't erase the things that happened. Healing will take many, many years. Not thirteen months. 

My dad + stepmom: My dad is a flake, and a liar. Always has been. He and my mom divorced about five years ago and within a year or two he was remarried. He has basically shown little interest in the lives of my sister or I since he left, I haven't talked to him in almost six months now, except to text him on Father's Day to see if we could make plans. He never texted back. He's busy with his new family, but I know he still expected to be part of the wedding, which will not be happening. He does not make an effort, and neither does his new family. That's their choice. They have two daughters that, initially, my sister and I really got along with. They have also stopped making an effort to see us, even going so far as staying upstairs and not even coming to say hi the last few times we went to my dads house, which is two hours away. I know it's because my dad's a habitual liar and would rather make up lies about my sister and I than admit he's being a shitty dad. He offered to pay for my wedding dress, "any dress you want!" then backed up to say "well, I'll only pay for your dress if you get it made by this seamstress I know that can sort of copy designs" (I've seen their work, it's okay but not what I want for my wedding. Think poofy quinceanera dresses and bright white fabric). Then back pedaled even farther to say they were having financial troubles, he was laid off (he got fired), they wouldn't be able to contribute. Fine. i wasn't expecting anything from them. But then he went and bought a new car and a new TV and pretended that they bought both of them with his wife's tax returns. Yeah. $25k in tax returns. I'm sure. I know he's in debt and I never expected any kind of contribution because he's basically just out of the picture now. He won't be walking me down the aisle. His daughters, who I once thought would be my bridesmaids, now don't even care enough to say hi. 

FMIL and her husband: FStepFIL is a cool old guy, a little traditional/conservative but wouldn't dream of imposing that on our wedding. FMIL is a different story. She loves the idea of our wedding so much that she basically wants to plan the whole thing herself. She overstepped yesterday and paid for our deposit on our venue knowing full well that that's something that FH and I wanted to do and that we had plenty in savings to be able to do it. The other day, she was supposed to meet FSIL for dinner (FSIL and her fiance live in the same building as FH and I). This was the night before our venue visit. FH and I were cooking a nice meal together, having a "date night in", drinking wine, about to watch a movie. FMIL calls and insists she has some paperwork that she has to bring over that night, it cant wait until the morning. (It's car registration, it can't be done in one day or on a sunday anyway.) But she nudges her way into our house, then asks FH to get something from his car (that, again, "can't wait", even though there's no way she can take it where it needs to go that night). Then she has the nerve to make comments about our dinner, and how good it smells, and how she wants to stay. There's only enough for two. Sorry. I already had to change into presentable clothing in my own house when it's 95 degrees so you could barge in. She then admits she's an hour early, that she was hoping she could just hang out here and, I quote, "watch us eat" while she waits. She can't. I'm going out with my sister after dinner/movie so I'm on a deadline and there's no way we'd be able to have date night if she stayed. Luckily, FH finally picked up on the frustration and realized he had a key to his sister's apartment, where he let FMIL in and told her she could wait there, but that we were busy. This is not the first time she's pulled something like this, not by a long shot. 

FFIL and his wife: The most logical, sane group of the bunch. Less outdoorsy than the rest, but totally all about our vision for our wedding, supportive of FH and I, non-confrontational, and understanding of every single thing we've told them so far. (For example, FstepMIL has a HUGE family three hours south of us. Our venue is about an hour north of them. I don't keep in close contact with all of them, maybe three of the smaller family units. When she asked which of them I'd be inviting, I carefully said I'd be inviting only those who I spoke to regularly, and that our wedding would be small, so we couldn't invite nearly all of them. Knowing my mom and FMIL, I was expecting resistance, but she just went "Oh, that makes sense. I can probably even guess who it is." And she was right and that was that.) 

Now, we're in Southern California - by no means a capitol of by-the-book traditionalist wedding planning. Every wedding here has something different, and that's great for FH and I because we are not simple or traditional by any means. We're lifelong scouts and campers, we love the outdoors, we would rather spend a month camping under the stars than at a fancy resort. We're doing okay financially, we have very little debt and are saving for our wedding at a significant pace. Our budget is around $20k, including our own contributions, which is awesome. We have quite a bit of play room here. We knew we didn't want a single day event, so we searched for seven months for our perfect venue. 

We visited it yesterday, and we loved it. It's perfect. It's pretty freaking rustic, the property is 128 years old and has been passed down through generations to the current owner and his wife. They're super sweet, majorly helpful, and we got to tour almost all of the property on a beautiful summer day. There are something like 10 cabins and lodges to rent, one big main house (three floors, sleeps 19!), a big old dance hall/soda fountain/general store/old post office, etc. The place is so charming it's actually painful. It's a full four day rental so we can spend quality time with the people we love most. We booked it on the spot for September 9th, 2017! And then the problems began. 

From the start of the meeting yesterday, MIL and mom took over. We could barely get a word in edgewise. They were talking about sailing and family vacations, and about us right in front of us. FH is a little quiet, and I could tell he felt a little off too. I am not normally a quiet or shy person by any means but I was more excited to see the venue, so I just let them do their thing. But we go on the tour and the whole time my mom is making this about her, and how much she'd love to come back up here in a few weeks and just stay for a weekend, and how she'd email the owner back right away, and etc. I don't like this for a few reasons, least of all being her overreach - she's my mom and she's excited. I get that. But at least give the first open weekend or two to FH and I so we can actually plan and see the place better. This is our wedding venue, not your new vacation home. 

FH and I took a walk on our own. I wanted a moment just for us. We ended up back at the ceremony site, with this insanely beautiful backdrop of trees and a big field and tons of golden sunlight. It's a special place. We made the decision together that this was our place, shortly after I swallowed a bug. Super romantic. 

Then, when we all sat down at the end and it seemed obvious we'd book, I asked FH to get the checkbook out of the car. Instead, FMIL pulled out her credit card and insisted that she pay for it. I had made it clear to both her and my mom that we wanted to pay this deposit. I'm by no means a control freak, and we're so so grateful for any contribution to the wedding, but this was something I had tried to be as clear as possible about without just saying NO. She still did it. And then I had to play the gushing, happy person who wasn't a bit offended and who didn't feel like I'd just been stepped on all day. 

So we drive the 2.5 hours home with traffic, drop my mom at her house, drop FMIL at her car. FH and I go to buy a bottle of champagne so we can celebrate a little. He's tired though so we pretty much drink it and go to sleep, with the promise that we'll celebrate a little more tonight and go over a planning timeline. 

I wake up this morning to no less than eleven texts. Three are spam from a wedding expo we went to earlier in the day. Two are from my mother about how I accidentally left some of the informational paperwork from the venue at her house, and how excited she is, and if I could please let her know how we plan on dividing the bedrooms in the main house (the rental of which is included in the price, unlike the other cabins, and which we will probably let some family use those rooms for free). Three are from people congratulating us on finally finding a venue. 

The rest are from FMIL - how fun the day before is, "now our planning begins!", then she asks me to send her photos (not sure which ones she's talking about) and she wants us to send her our guests list so she can "tweak it". It's like the second she forked over money for the deposit, she thinks that gives her the magic editing tool so she can invite or uninvite whoever she wants. I know it's probably not that dramatic, but could she not have given us 24 hours? The guest list doesn't need to be finalized for a few months, and she knows ours has only been written and looked over once or twice but that it's not getting any major changes.  We are inviting less than 100 people. 85% of that is family, or more. The rest are our closest/oldest friends. There's also the small family I nanny for. Nobody else, nobody extra. This is not up for debate. We know a good chunk of them still won't be able to make it for a full weekend, but we are still expecting about 65 for at least day of, and probably 50 overnight or full weekend (since 50 pretty much covers parents, siblings, stepsiblings, siblings kids, grandparents, and that's it). Our venue can take 100 but we don't want to pay for 100 people. We want to have a little wiggle room. And we don't want people there that we don't know or don't deeply care about. 

I haven't responded to either of them yet. I had intended to use the main house for certain sets of parents (I know my mom and her bf and my dad and co won't be using them), my bridal party, and my nephew's adoptive family. My mom wants me to offer it only to family. I know most of the family we've invited wouldn't even want to stay in the main house but she's acting like I'd be making a huge mistake asking my (very small!) bridal party (not including the stepsisters, so literally just like six people) if they'd like to use the rooms. 

This is already turning into a huge headache. I know FH has a problem saying NO to his mom. I want to involve my mom but she's overstepped too. (She actually just texted me as I'm typing this saying she doesn't mean to overstep, that I just need to tell her when I need her. She thinks it's that simple. If I do tell her, she'll sigh about it and make a big deal about it for several months.) 

FH is never going to tell his mother to stop, so that's going to be on me, unfortunately. FH is a bit shy and non-confrontational all the time, and I'm okay with being the one who has to put my foot down. I don't know if I'm being crazy and unreasonable. I don't think I am. I just like to have all my details lined up, I am very detail oriented and I have a way that I picture things going that does not involve parental overstep. 

I guess most of that was venting, but I also need some advice on how to talk to parents - namely, (1.) how to tell MIL that she will not be tweaking our guest list, that there's no room on our list for tweaking, that we appreciate her effort and contributions but that we're doing the majority planning ourselves, and when we have need of her, she'll know. I fully intend to have many things for her to do farther on in planning, but I'm not going to let her overstep and make us make major decisions early on that we don't want to make. Also, (2.) how to tell mom that I love her but that she needs to take a chill pill, that I'll give her a list of who might get what rooms when I've had time to at least eat a meal or two and be allowed to think for a while, and that I do not want her visiting our venue again before we've had the chance to, that the place gets busy in non-winter months and that it can book up, and that our visiting it and planning there is more of a priority than her vacation weekend. 

Both mothers made sure the venue owner had their emails and phone numbers listed as contact people. I also need a way (3.) to ask the venue owners to make sure that all communication goes through FH and I FIRST, and that we'll forward any applicable information to our mothers as we see fit. I don't want to come off as controlling, but I need to let him know that this is how it needs to be.

I also have to (4.) Let my father know that he will not be walking me down the aisle. That his daughters will be honorary bridesmaids but will not stand at the front with the bridal party (this is a thing that's not just about them, we initially planned on a bigger wedding and 7 party members each, we still want everyone to be part our or bigger wedding party, go to bachelor/bachelorette parties, etc, but only 3 or 4 people each will be standing with us now, also my FH's sister will match my bridesmaids but will stand on his side). I know this will be upsetting for him to hear, even though it should be obvious. He and I were very close when I was young, before my parents divorced. We stuck together even after their divorce went nuclear. He just stopped caring. I don't want to blame him for that, we're busy and we both have new lives. It's okay. I'm not even really mad about it. But I need to let him know that, because time and distance have separated us, that he and his new family will be no more than guests at my wedding. 

I already have a headache, and I guarantee it's not from the champagne last night. Sorry if this was long. I have tried to be as accommodating as I can over the last few months, I've let them know I intend to include them in planning in some way and that I'll let them know when they're needed. I DO WANT their help in some places, but not in others, and I can't have a bunch of people asking me for shit constantly. I used to be a total doormat when I was younger and I let my anxiety run my life, but my FH has made me a stronger person. I can finally tell someone "NO" without it being an apology like "Uh, actually, um, I'm really really sorry but..." I'm not going to start this wedding planning process by letting our toes get stepped on. I'm not going to let anyone dig that hole any deeper. 

If I'm being neurotic, say so. If you've got advice, I'll take it. If you've got internet hugs, I'll take those too. Ugh.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes! We plan on it. There are cans of the stuff at every building anyway. My FHs main concern is the guests reactions to bugs, but we have a group of very outdoorsy family and they'll know well ahead of time. It's not like it's mosquitoes or anything, which is nice, but I did swallow a bug yesterday, which I'm pretty sure is some kind of spiritually binding contract stating that I must get married there. 

There's going to be a mass email/text in the week before the wedding, and a big note on the website about the actual terrain and bugs and rustic cabins, and then we're going to basically buy shares in OFF!, buy a case of the stuff, and call it a day.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's like you're me, writing about my dad! He promised to pay for my dress, "whatever dress you want!" and insisted that he'd be contributing at least 5k to my wedding. Knowing that this was hardly the first time he's flaked on me, I didn't take any of it too seriously. Then he got "laid off" (he got fired, for cause, so now can't continue working for the union where he's spent several years climbing in rank very slowly). Then they bought a huge new TV. Then they got a new car. Then they got a new dog. Actually, are you sure you're not me? Double check. If you're currently steaming from the ears, you know the truth. 

Seriously though. At least I have a history of knowing my dad is not going to come through. I wrote him off the second he started adding "conditions" to his financial contributions - ("well, i didn't mean any dress, i meant any dress you pick that my seamstress friend will make for you for $500, oh and my contribution is only for the dress, nothing else, so did I say $5000? I meant a conditional $500!") - and then by the time he started buying new things, I wrote in his contribution at $0. It wasn't disappointing in the sense of "I wish he'd pick up the slack." It was just "there goes dad again." Months after that his WIFE sent a text to say that they were flat broke and couldn't contribute. He's working again and buying fancy stuff again and he's just not talking to me at this point because that might mean admitting he was being weird. 

I'm sorry. Hugs all around.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's far from most people's dream venue - it's a camping and cabin resort, faaaar up a mountain, with no cell service. There are bugs. The cabins are fairly rustic. 

But the views are insane. The ceremony spot is breathtaking. The property is 128 years old and has been passed down through generations. The owners are incredibly sweet and helpful. 

It's a four day rental, so we get to spend several days with our nearest and dearest. #camppeterson2017. Yes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you. I just needed another opinion to boost my confidence in my plan. I don't want to make a big deal out of it so I'll basically tell them how it's going to be (just the four people standing) and then ask if they'd like to be part of all the events and stuff as part of the wedding party. They don't have to know I don't consider them official I think. They just need to know they're not standing but that I still want them there. It's still an offer, even if it's a little different than they might have imagined. 

Also yeah, my fianc is kind of a boss and I love him. He kicks ass. He's my polar opposite in many ways but it's good for us. And the day he confessed about the money thing I cried. I cried so hard. He saw how miserable and upset I was and was willing to take a big financial loss over just a small hope that my dad would turn around. He's been so supportive through this whole thing and he's my best friend. I can't wait to marry this guy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Definitely plan a ton of activities. Even just a park can be a good use of a few hours. Make it a picnic. Museums, movies, indoor playgrounds, check your local library to see if they have a kids program with story time or something like that (ours has a 30min session 4x a week that 3F adores). Sometimes kids even just like going to places like Target or whatever and they can walk around and look at stuff and maybe get a dollar bin toy, something the little one won't care too much about that can be "special" for the big guy can go a long way in helping the jealousy. Giving him little helper tasks can be great too! especially when they're doing something the baby can't help with - helping pick up or sweep, helping wipe down a table or counter, helping pick out snacks or sorting something (I have basically dumped out a big box of crayons and 3F has been excited to sort it out for 20+ minutes).

It's going to be TOUGH when DB leaves, but keep the little ones busy. A family I babysat for a few times had a dad that drove big rigs for days or weeks at a time. The mom printed out a little picture of daddy and put it in a keychain thing so whenever the little girl missed him, she could look at his picture and give him a hug or kiss and tell him secrets. I thought that was cute and it tended to work pretty well sometimes. Not all the time.  </TEXT>

I made it clear that it was up to them to contribute in the normal way but that we didn't expect anything from anyone so it was up to them. At this point I don't even want money from them.

<TEXT> All I'm saying is that this will be my last nanny job, I have officially decided. I've been long-term sitting and nannying for several years. I am done. This family is usually so amazing to work for, I know there are obvious nanny job problems we all deal with, but I'm just at the end of my rope. Tantrums are getting ridiculous. I'll probably work for these guys one more year. Maybe a little longer. Then who knows what I'll do. 

There have been six major tantrums this morning. It's not even 11AM. Two each from a toddler, a 7F, and a 9M. A nine year old boy and a seven year old girl throwing tantrums with crying and screaming and kicking on the floor. That's beyond my lexicon. I have never known kids this ill behaved. They can be such great kids but they're awful when they have to follow rules or when they get punishment for anything.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay, a little backstory. My fianc and I have been together for over four and a half years. We got engaged in December, finally found our perfect venue, and are hopefully booking it on Sunday! I've posted here before about my dad but the problem has expanded to now include my stepmother and stepsisters. 

Right when my fianc and I got together, my parents were divorcing. I was 20, it was hell, they were extremely toxic to each other and to our family. Separately they're both okay but my parents lack maturity and are both troubled. Roughly two years later, my dad remarried. At the time things seemed great - they invited us out to their house all the time (2 hours away) and we talked all the time. My stepmother has two daughters who I adore. They're younger than my sister and I (I'm 25, my sister is 22, they're 20 and 19) and we all got along really well. My initial thought was that I would have all my sisters as bridesmaids. That would mean my sister, those two stepsisters, my youngest stepsister from my moms relationship (17), and my two closest friends. 

However, the last year or two has been different. My dad is a pathological liar and a flake. He likes to pretend he's making an effort but really doesn't. He tells people that my sister and I never call him back, etc etc. That's sort of beside the point, he moved two hours away from us and stopped making plans and was always busy. As it stands now I haven't seen any of them since February. 

This is not without having made an effort. I have called and texted my father and my stepmother. They just don't bother to answer or they do and then they say they'll let me know when they're free. I texted him on Father's Day and he replied twice, told me he'd call me, told me he'd let me know when they were free, and didn't. 

I know for a fact that he's lying about us to his side of the family. Even the extended family. My great aunt asked if I would even be at his wedding waaaay back when and that's when I realized he'd started lying. I don't doubt he's continued to poison my own family against me. The sisters no longer text me back. 

That's the problem - I now only talk to these sisters maybe three times a year, when I see them for holidays. I don't have a ton of friends, so sisters made sense to talk about for bridesmaids when I wasn't yet engaged and when we were all getting along well. At that time, there was no doubt they would have been my bridesmaids. But time passed. We took a while to get engaged. When we do see each other it's all hugs and getting along like we see each other all the time. But that's two or three times a year. 

But our wedding is small. 100 people, probably only 70 attending. I'm okay with this. We don't have a ton of friends and we don't have jobs where we'd ever invite coworkers. We're renting this camping/resort place out, up a mountain, and we've got the place for four days. It's going to all be pretty informal. Originally our guest list was over 130 and we planned to have something a little more traditional, so having 6 bridesmaids made sense. Now it doesn't. And honestly, I just don't want them up there with me. They haven't made an effort. They probably have had their opinions of me poisoned by my father already. I'll admit I haven't reached out yet either but I'm not about to make a big deal for two girls who I don't see often and who, even when we do head out to their house, sometimes don't even come downstairs to say hi. Seriously. 

My dad and his wife have also decided that, despite their initial offerings to contribute financially to the wedding, they will not be giving us any money. My dad initially offered to pay for my dress, but so did my mom and grandma and others. I don't need 15k worth of dress. So I told him he was welcome to contribute any amount he was comfortable with and know that it would at least in part be going to my dress. He didn't answer for several weeks then tried to tell me that I should get my dress made by this seamstress they know in downtown LA. I do not want that. It's a personal decision. They told me for $500 I could have any dress made I want. Again, I do not want that. They kept pressuring me, I kept giving them the "general contribution" line. Eventually his wife responded telling me they're really short on money (yeah, neither of them are working! He's scamming disability and she's doing who knows what, and they've bought three new cars in the last five years.) 

My dad also is just a shit person. He once several years ago gave my fianc and I a few hundred dollars when we were in a crunch and insisted we didn't pay him back. He said it was a gift and he was happy to help. As part of the divorce agreement, he was also supposed to give me $2k to help buy a car while my mom helped my sister. He gave me $900. I wasn't going to complain. Both were, to my understanding, never to be paid back. About two years ago my dad got fired (he claims he quit but he collected unemployment and is no longer allowed to work for the union he was working for). He basically texted me one day and asked how soon I could pay all of it back. I didn't answer him for a week, I was floored. They were gifts. He'd reiterated multiple times that I was not to pay him back. I was, at the time, out of work because I have a moderate disability and was dealing with big health issues. I had medical bills up to my ears. I told him I thought it was a gift, but that if he had changed his mind I could pay him $50 a month from my unemployment checks. He never answered. And in fact; that's the time he stopped inviting us out to the house all the time. He stopped answering my calls and texts. He blocked me on freaking Facebook. I was devastated. He had pulled little shit before but cutting me out of his life over money was shitty. 

A few months later he called me and made plans. I thought he had just had a hissy fit and was over it. He's dramatic. I was happy he was trying again, we had dinner, it was great. He started making a minor effort again and I thought things would be okay. Then he stopped calling again. He'd answer my calls after a few days but was always busy. I got a new phone and went to get my dads number off my fiance's phone. His texts were open and I had occasionally used my fiance's phone to text my dad when we were on the way to their house, so I decided to get the number from there. Instead I saw a weird text from my dad that said "Sure, I'll be here this afternoon". That was weird. I opened it. It was dated on my dads birthday a few months before. Right around the time he'd called to make plans. I opened the texts and saw my then-boyfriend, now fianc, had sent a text that said "I have something to drop off for you, will you be home?" In hindsight, my stupid selfish father probably thought my fianc was bringing him a birthday gift. He was working an hour and a half away from my dad and took a half day to drive out there. I confronted him and he confessed that he'd taken a sizable amount of his own money and driven out to give it to my father. He said he hated money coming between family and he had given it to my father as reverse Shut Up Money. He had given nearly a thousand dollars of his own money to my father under the condition that my father make a better effort to be a part of my life. It lasted a few months. I so appreciate that my fianc even tried, and I know he did it behind my back because he knew I'd say now he knows why. Since then I have known that my father will not be walking me down the aisle. He literally couldn't even keep up a relationship with me when someone paid him to do it. 

I was always close with my dad as a kid. I still want him there. But he and his family will be guests, not wedding party. 

I think it's assumed that the girls would be bridesmaids, I mentioned it to them once or twice and mused about bachelorette party ideas. I need a tactful way to rescind that. It's not about my dads refusal to contribute. I just don't feel like our relationship is strong enough that I want them up with me. It was once. It isn't anymore. It's not entirely their fault, my dad is poison, but they haven't made an effort either. 

I would still love if they would get ready with me, go to the bachelorette party, etc. I want them to know I still want them to be part of my day. But not standing. My list will then be my bio sister, my youngest stepsister, and my two closest friends. 

 I do sort of have one idea but I have no idea how it would sound to other people. My fiance's sister is going to be standing on his side. I had initially planned on asking her to be a bridesmaid but she's close with my fianc and I think it's so sweet that he wants her in his wedding party. She's going to wear what the bridesmaids wear, or at least the right color, she's just standing on his side. She's sort of an honorary bridesmaid since she'll be doing all the bachelorette stuff and all that with me. I'm thinking of letting the sisters know that they're honorary bridesmaids, but that since my fianc doesn't have a ton of friends to be groomsmen and our ceremony space is admittedly a little small, that I just don't have room for everyone up front. That they'll sit front row and they can wear the same color as the bridesmaids. Come to all the events with us. Get ready with us. Etc. 

I don't know what to do. I just would not be comfortable having them up there. It would just make me sad. Theres just not a solid relationship. But I feel bad anyway. I felt bad about my dad at first but I don't anymore. 

Sorry this was all over the place and so long. I've been thinking about the situation as just me vs dad for a while and only in the last few weeks considered the sisters. It really hit me this morning that this is how I need to do things. I cried. I'm not good at this. It would have been easier to just do this to my dad but now I'm doing it to that whole part of the family. 

Help.  </TEXT>

Maybe have a verbal face to face conversation with her about what exactly you guys are looking for in this other girl, physical stuff and all that, but let HER do the talking and be careful about which parts you agree with. i.e. If she's a blonde, don't be like "yeah, redheads are my favorite!" 

My SO and I have had the same conversations, and he lets me point girls out for this exact reason. I roughly know what he's interested in because I look in a mirror! But from a woman's perspective, even in the context of talking about a threesome, it can be hard to hear a partner talking about things or specific people they want to bang that are not us.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love Melissa as A, I love Toby's involvement, I love all of it. 

Spencer has been sketchy as fuck though. So as much as I hate Spoby, I would not hate an ending where the two of them - who pretended to be on the A team loooong ago - are actually Melissa's right hand henchpeople, and organizing this whole thing. His engagement to Yvonne is just a facade, Wren is in there somewhere, my poor baby Mona is going to go by the wayside partially because she's too smart and also because Spencer still holds a grudge, whatever. It's a fantasy. It's never going to happen and it probably doesn't reeeeally make any sense but I don't care.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is probably my favorite pan. This shit and BeneTint last AGES and I can't ever seem to get through even a travel size. I got a peel off Korean lip tint though that ends up sort of like Stainiac looks on my lips, so I've been using Stainiac for touch ups. I've had it for well over a year and it looks brand new. You mentioned using it as a blush so that takes more product but damn. Respect, OP.  </TEXT>

I missed out on the Tinder years and the blind dates and the ghosting and the letting people down easy. Thank god. I could not handle dating now. I would literally rather just not find a partner. Luckily I almost literally fell into this dude's lap. 

The last single date I went on was in 2010. I was like 19. I think this guy took me to a movie. Simpler times. Simpler times indeed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The day I realized I needed to step away from Facebook was truly freeing. I used to post multiple times a day, I was on for sometimes hours at a time, couldn't stop reading. I HAD TO KNOW what others were up to. I felt like I needed to be good enough for people online to see. 

Nope. Shortly after I deleted all but ~100 Facebook friends (from ~1500!) and stopped following hundreds of IG accounts. I basically only use it once or twice a week now and it's so liberating. I'm more present in my own life. My anxiety is close to zero, which is insane. I was having panic attacks and constant ruminations about how my life was so subpar, how unhappy I was, etc. I didn't realize it was a social media problem until like two months later when I realized how much happier I was.

<TEXT> Partners who refuse counseling like this typically do so because they're embarrassed. Their partner is calling them out on shit they've been getting away with for years, and they know a neutral party who says shit like "you have to actually help parent your children" and "having an affair is a terrible thing to do" is going to strengthen their partner. They don't want that. 

It doesn't sound like things got worked out on your own. It sounds like you threw a bandaid over the problem and it went away because he said a few things he knew you wanted to hear. Therapy can help but it sounds like your relationship does not have a good history. Demand cooperation in therapy and a FAIR share of parenting duties or leave this guy.  </TEXT>

The only palettes I really kept were two Coastal Scents Revealed palettes (cheap enough that I don't care if I'm only using half of the shades) and an older Tarte palette. I rebuilt my shadow collection from MAC singles. They're only $6 now and a big empty palette from them isn't too expensive. I had forgotten about MAC for so long in favor of Sephora brands but MAC is my go-to for shadows again.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This could have been my post 4.5 years ago. I had had quite a few sexual partners but was a party girl and picked many bad dudes. My now fianc had been a virgin when we met. The first time we had sex he was like "are you sure you want to?" And I was like "no, it's up to you, given circumstances this is your choice" and he was like "no, actually it isn't, I obviously want to (*gestures to raging boner*) but it's still your choice, do you want to?" 

Oooopen the floodgates. Physically I was like KNEES UP but emotionally in my head I was like "cool I'm gonna happy cry later when you're sleeping" 

And now I'm gonna marry that dude so hard  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not saying I've ever done it - I haven't, by the way, but I'm living a totally different set of circumstances. I'm saying I have known nannies who have done it. It's partially a stability thing, too - if a nanny is on unemployment and takes a nanny job over the table and it ends up not being a good fit, she can't quit and go back to unemployment until she finds a better fit. Quitting an over the table job will make her ineligible for unemployment. She then loses the dependable source of income through unemployment that she still definitely needs, just because the kids aren't a good fit or the family is weird or any number of problems. We all know finding a perfect fit family is difficult.

<TEXT> Okay, I see a lot of people offering the same advice and to tell your friend to move out sooner and to not tell the boyfriend, but this needs to be expanded upon for clarity's sake because every detail is very important when getting out of a relationship that's this chaotic. 

1. Angela's son can never be in this guy's presence again. He is clearly not in a sane state and its not worth risking any sort of greeting or goodbye if he's proven to be this far gone. 

2. Angela needs to gather her important paperwork and documents. Offer to hold it for her while she makes the transition. 

3. Ask for a police escort to move her. They can basically make it so that he can't be on the property for 24-48 hours so that she can safely move her things out, and if there are officers present while she's moving, he'll be a lot less likely to get violent. She needs to get a temporary restraining order also, and work on a permanent one, but getting out and staying somewhere he can't find her for at least a week is the biggest part. 

4. Remind her that making a scene is a hell of a lot less important than staying alive. If you've had to hide knives in your house, saving face is the least of her concerns. If she wants her kid to still have his mom, and she might need to be reminded that it is exactly that serious, she needs to carefully but quickly remove herself from this guy. 

You may also want to get a restraining order against this guy. He was like this in your home. You were afraid to sleep in your own home. Because you stood up to him once before, he will think of you when he's thinking of places she could be. Preemptively get an order and serve him so that he doesn't get a chance to come after you. 

A lot of people have mentioned the involuntary admittance. Call 911. Call now. Tell them that he is a threat to Angela, that she has a son, that he's threatened to kill her and himself and that he's self-harmed in front of you all before. Go through the whole evening in detail. The drugs, the threats, all of it. 

Do not wait until something has already happened. He could kill her. It's not worth waiting for. Hesitation could mean her death. I repeat it only because I've seen it happen and you'd be stupid not to take action now. 

Editing to add: do not have her stay with you. It's a place he could easily find her just by looking places where he's gotten like this before. His thought process would easily go from "she's trying to get me" to "everyone's out to get me" to "who has stood up to me and seen how I treat her?" Help her find a women's shelter or an unknown friends house or a cheap hotel room. Make sure anyone there knows to pretend she isn't there. She may hesitate to make a statement to police immediately, but you don't have to. You know you fucked up by letting her go. You regret that. Don't screw this up again.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For some nannies, it's not a pay scale problem as much as it is other arrangements. I get paid under the table and that's the only reason I get my health insurance covered by the government. I have health issues that qualify me for MediCal if I don't have a job. If I were being paid over the table at my current rate, I'd actually bring home ~12 an hour with CA taxes, x30 hours is 360. I would be paying almost 250 a month for insurance that wouldn't be as good, plus copay. I currently bring home 450 a week. If I did taxes and insurance, I'd be bringing home ~300.

They could also be collecting unemployment, and being payrolled will jeopardize that. I have known three nannies who have collected unemployment while nannying. To them, they could be getting paid under the table plus unemployment, or over the table and without unemployment. So it can be a bigger difference than it looks like on paper, even if they don't admit to whatever reasons they might have for not taking taxes out.  </TEXT>

Roulette, Birthday Girl, Kimono, and Rumer Has It have been paid for. Daddy and Hammered have been claimed but not paid for and could fall through. Girl Crush, Bae, Nillionaire, have not been claimed yet. The cheek stuff, someone has expressed interest in the full lot but not paid, except for Between the Sheets, which was claimed before that and not paid yet, so if those fall through, you're next in line.

<TEXT> Hi! This is my first time attempting to sell on MUE, though I've bought a half dozen different things from here before. I've been meaning to get rid of some of this stuff for a long time and, with the reorganization of my house/battlestation/life, I decided now was the time to do it. I have a HUGE stash of BNIB Benefit items - I won them in a contest a little while ago and can't find anyone to give certain shades to, so they're being offered here at a decent discount to anyone who fits the bill! I also have a TON of lightly used Colourpop shadows and blushes and highlighters.

I'm not currently looking for swaps, only selling. I'm getting married in a little over a year and I need to start saving! :) Please feel free to make an offer if you would like to try a different price on anything offered. I've listed retail prices and what I think is fair, but I'm up for most negotiations! 

All items have been sanitized/cleaned prior to shipment, as well as can be done. 

If an item is no longer listed, it's unavailable and paid for. 

Items marked with an (!) after the price are also available as FWP - one item per $20 pre-shipping. 

Minimum purchase of $10. 

Shipping starts at $3 and increases with weight/number of items. Tracking will be provided as soon as I can ship. I ship as soon as I receive payment. Failure to pay within 24 hours will mean I release product back into sale. PayPal gift only, please.

<TEXT> It's like you're me, from the past! 

Despite what you may be feeling right now, your diagnosis is a GREAT thing. Chiari is treatable. I have Chiari 0 in addition to Syringomyelia, which basically means that my whole spinal cord/brain stem combo isn't reacting well to pressure. 

I went ~8 years with migraines that didn't respond to migraine medication, and worsening back pain that nobody could explain, as I was an otherwise healthy 22 year old. An ER doc finally told me I should see a neurologist, that neurologist put in the whole slew of tests, including - you guessed it - the MRI. That MRI revealed Chiari 0 (very slight herniation, mine is more about the pressure in the brain stem area because of the SM also) and a decent-sized syrinx (fluid-filled cyst that's actually inside my spinal cord, which is not where things are supposed to be.) 

SM isn't treatable for me - I'm not a surgical candidate - but Chiari is infinitely more treatable and I've spoken with so many people who have or haven't had surgery and have gone on to lead fairly normal lives. This is not a death sentence. It's sure as hell scary, and the terminology can freak you out, but you're going to be okay! And now that your doctors have something to work with, my biggest piece of advice is to be proactive in your own health care. Push for specialist visits, push for repeat MRIs, ask for a full spinal MRI if you haven't gotten one already. 

Funny enough, MY docs also think my Chiari/Syringomyelia is not the cause of MY migraine issues - so that's still being searched for several years later. But it's a good thing that they found this! 

Do your research. Find and talk to people with Chiari, which won't be hard. Check Facebook for support groups - they've been a HUGE help to me - and look for in-person support groups for anything from chronic pain to nerve damage to cerebrospinal and head trauma. It's hard to find a perfect fit for illnesses like this but finding the right group will be SUCH a relief. Talking to others who have been in your shoes is invaluable. 

If you have any questions or anything please don't hesitate to PM me!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yay! I can totally relate. SOs do the best shit sometimes. Mine was a little crazy. 

When my parents were divorcing, right around the time I met my SO, part of their agreement was that they were supposed to give us money to help us get a cheap used car to get around - to the tune of $2k. My mom gave my sister her money, my dad gave me $800 in cash and never said anything about it. I tried breaching the subject a few times but he'd just change topics. My dad is kind of an ass. So then like a year later, he's doing well financially, and we're having trouble because I was out of work for a few months for health reasons. My dad gives us like $800 again and says it makes up for how short he was with the first payment (it doesn't) and that he insists we don't pay it back and it isn't a loan. He stresses this point, like he wants to FEEL like he made it up to us. Don't get me wrong, it was a huge help, but he still never lived up to his end of the bargain. 

Two years ago he quit his job out of nowhere and was then struggling for money. He asked when I was going to pay him back all of that money I owed him. I was fucking livid. I didn't respond to him, I didn't want to talk to him. I finally texted back to remind him that he said I shouldn't ever have to pay him back and to remind him that I'm up to my neck in medical debt and have zero way to repay him. He started being a jerk, stopped answering my calls, etc. I was then devastated, because it was clear to me that my father was only making an effort to get the money out of me and didn't actually want to see us. Then like three weeks later he texted saying we should get dinner, hang out, whatever. I was skeptical but it seemed like he had started to put it behind him and maybe realized he'd been a jerk. 

Nope. Months later I was using my SO's phone to get my dad's number since I had gotten a new phone. His texts were open so I just decided to use that to get the number. I had occasionally used SOs phone to text my dad that we were on our way out there (two hour drive) if my phone was dead. There were two weird texts between him and my dad, on my dad's birthday. SO said "Will you be home today? I have something I wanted to drop off to you." My dad said "Sure, I'll be home all afternoon." That was it. That was around the time my dad started talking to me again. I connected the dots pretty quickly, but basically my SO gave my dad almost a thousand dollars. When I confronted SO he said he didn't like to see money get between people, especially family, so he gave my dad "shut up money". It worked for a little while, anyway, but it totally blew my mind. I mean we'd been together like three years, and I know my SO is that kind of person, but he didn't want me to feel bad about the money, since it was all SO's personal money, so he just didn't say anything to me. He had hoped so badly that my dad would change, which I would not have hoped because I know my dad, but SO did it just with a hope that my dad would start to treat me better. 

I can totally imagine the scene at the door, too. My very quiet but strong SO shows up to my dad's house (not even his house, his wife's mother's house where they all live, so he's not even paying rent?? How is he so broke??), dad answers door, confused as to what it is to be dropped off. Dad stupidly assumes it's a present or something. 

Ends up that was pretty much the truth. He basically walked up, handed my dad a bunch of cash in an envelope, said "That's all there's ever going to be, start answering her calls, do not ask subject1963 for money ever again." 

Dad went back to not giving a shit a few months later, but still. Damn. SO coming through as usual. 


He also basically helped me build my credit from having no credit history to having awesome credit. My mom had offered to help me get started but she has TERRIBLE credit, so SO swooped in fairly early in our relationship and got a joint credit card with me so I wouldn't be connected to my mom's credit in anyway. I now have excellent credit. Fuck yeah.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My depression comes and goes in waves, at times manageable and minor, but often crushing and absolutely debilitating. I often question if what I'm experiencing is "just" depression. I have a chronic illness and a wedding to plan, a decent job and an unsavory past. I'm just trying to look forward. I'm just trying to be better. 

But I can't do that without a little help. My fianc has trouble missing emotional cues, he had a weird childhood, so he often doesn't see the signs of my depression until I'm already in bed at 6:30PM or standing in front of the open fridge for twenty minutes or I've skipped showering for four days. I've tried to teach him but when it comes to sensitive topics, he's a slow learner. He takes care of me in a way I never imagined could be possible, he handles my illness so well now, but my depression is some mystic level shit that he can't seem to wrap his head around. 

I've at least gotten to the point where I recognize exactly what my depression is - a severe imbalance of chemicals in my brain that make me feel like absolute trash. Rationally, I know that this is it. It doesn't make it any easier to deal with. And I don't need any less support. I need just as much. But it's still... Lacking, sometimes. I can't expect him to be perfect. And of course I miss the good things when I'm too wrapped up in blankets and self-pity. 

So it's 1:20AM, I have to be up for work in 5 hours, I can hear him softly snoring in the other room, and I envy his comfort. I envy his sanity.

He's logical to a fault, we've not-so-jokingly referred to him as a robot. He can manage our finances and make sure we eat dinner and find my missing birth certificate and email it where it needs to go. He can make sure I remember to call the right people and take some me time and he encourages me to go get coffee and write on my days off. He can basically handle my day to day minutiae with ease but he can't tell when I'm suffocating. 

There are times, though... When he pulls me away from the fridge doors, gets me some water, and holds my hand on the couch. When he curls up behind me in bed and presses his face into my hair and tells me he loves me. When he asks what he can do for me, what I need. 

But those times are not common. They are fleeting. And then I'm back under the covers by myself while he balances the checkbook. Sorry, honey. The electric bill is due, so I can't be your lighthouse.

<TEXT> Very simply put: tell your boyfriend that the immature ploy to sleep with other women is a deal breaker. He has zero right to say those things. 

Example: I was a floozy in college, and high school, and pretty much all the time before I met my fianc. For five years now it's been all him but I had slept with 19 (19!) guys before him. My fianc was a virgin when we met. If he ever told me he had to go out and sleep with 19 women to make things "even", I'd tell him to go fuck himself. Sexual history is not a competition. And you're not awful for sleeping with other people as a young adult. 

Your boyfriend does not respect you. This is crazy. No. Just no.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Out of courtesy, wait a few months to get engaged. Give the sister her own time to be in the spotlight. You can always start wedding planning before you get engaged, anyway. Nobody needs to know. 

As for wedding dates, I suggest you and your SO pull the sister aside and explain that you guys are also ready to get married, that you were looking at June, and that you want to let her know ahead of time so that she's not told out of the blue and thrown off. That you wanted to come to her first so she wouldn't feel stepped on. 

However, don't let her responses have a huge bearing on what you do regarding planning. Stick to whatever dates you want. Do what you're going to do. But warn a girl, and even if she's pissed about it, she can't say you're blindsiding her.  </TEXT>

I gave my parents each an ultimatum. They can behave and be at the very least cordial, or they can miss my wedding. I told both that I will not tolerate any fighting or drama at my wedding, so they have the option to leave or they will be removed if they cause problems. 

As for the legal side, try contacting your county to ask what might need to be done regarding the orders and If it requires a lawyer. I don't have too much experience there. 

Big picture though, if you suspect that any drama might happen between your parents, set the rule and let them break it if they want. Hire a security person for the ceremony and reception. It will be worth the peace of mind.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> DO NOT give these people money. Not unless they're willing to pursue a relationship without the money attached. 

Your wife's mother sounds like a raging jerk from what you've told me. She clearly had a bit of a tough relationship with her after meeting you, and if her mother was that harsh before you, which I'm sure she was, it could not have been good times. It's all about her, she sends the sister as the olive branch while she sits back and does everything in her power to get what she wants without having to show any form of remorse. 

They disowned your wife. She needs to disown them too. Money will not help their relationship or teach your MiL a lesson. It will only cause more disappointment. 

When my SO and I were having some mild financial troubles a few years back, my father - who is similarly selfish and rude normally but seemed to be in a good mood - offered to give us a few hundred dollars to carry us over while I was unable to work because of health issues. He insisted that we never pay him back, that it was a gift. 

Almost three years later, he's out of work and asks me if I'm ever going to pay back that money he lent us forever ago, and that he needs us to start making payments to him. I reminded him that it was a gift, but that if he needed money I would be glad to give him what I could afford to give him for a month or two until he got back on his feet. I couldn't pay back the whole amount (I'm disabled!) but I would do whatever I could. He had asked for $1200 back, I told him I could get him roughly $100 a month until I had some medical bills due 2-3 months from then. But that after that, I needed that money for rent and bills and that's all I'd have. It was clearly not the whole amount, but I had never expected to have to pay the money back, so it just wasn't possible. 

He started ignoring my texts and calls, and when I could get a hold of him he said he was busy. He just wanted money. He showed his true colors. After a month or two of being devastated by his actions, he started calling and texting again and asking when we would come to dinner. I thought he was just doing better and wanted to rebuild our relationship. Nope. Ended up my SO went to my dads house and handed him money, to the tune of eight hundred dollars, so that my dad would stop being a jerk to me. A few months later my dad was back to being busy all the time and not calling. I think he realized we weren't going to keep giving him money when he wasn't even trying to get a job. 

Giving your wife's mother your money will not help cure her cancer. She knows you're doing well for yourselves and she's regretting cutting you guys off ONLY because it would be easier to get money from you. Tell the sister you're not able to contribute at the moment, but that you'd like to get together soon anyway. See how much they actually care when you let them know they won't be getting a dime.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For a period of time I was trying to stop using harsh chemicals on my hair and skin to see if I had any improvement. I used skincare solely from Lush for several months and dropped hundreds of dollars, and I don't think it helped that much in the end. Was it harmful? Not necessarily. My skin felt oiler and never really felt clean, but it was hydrated (all those oils!) and that's not too bad. My skin is super sensitive and drastically combination so it was nice to just have to deal with oiliness for a while. But it ended up increasing the number of comedones in my opinion and the products are so so expensive for what they are. I dropped the lush thing for normal drugstore face wash a few months ago, and just last month switched to the SCA routine. It hasn't helped me a ton either but it costs a hell of a lot less to figure that out than Lush cost me.  </TEXT>

The fact that he admits it was wrong and you trust him is step one. Step two is setting those goals he was talking about. Do you think he cheated on you? Are you going to break up with him? It doesn't sound like it and I wouldn't in your place, so the only thing to do is move forward. Make goals moving forward but make sure they're not solely about you - if he suggests a goal related to your education or career, suggest that he set a goal for emotional growth. He needs to realize your career is not up to him, but you need to realize he's in a place where he's moving on up and being successful and he's feeling like you have the potential to move upward with him but you're choosing not to.

We're looking at what we're pretty sure is going to be our venue later this month, with a projected date range of next August - September. There are a few things my fianc and I have known from the beginning are things we definitely wanted in a wedding - a full weekend to enjoy with family and friends, somewhere in the mountains with plenty of trees/greenery, something laid back, etc. We're both long time scouts and our love for camping and the outdoors is a big factor in our relationship and a big part of who we are. We've been very clear from the beginning with family that we're going to do most of the planning ourselves, but every time wedding talk comes up, it seems like certain sets of parents forget whose wedding this actually is. 

We haven't even started serious planning and I'm already at the end of my rope. Part of me just needs to vent but if anyone has any advice on any of this, please pipe up. 

Our parents are all divorced and remarried, giving us four full sets of parents, a sister on each side, and five step siblings total. Factor in the amount of aunts and uncles, step family, cousins, etc, our list of "close family" is at 90, and we're including only a dozen or so of our closest friends. People we'd actually want to spend a whole weekend with. We did a lot of the initial brainstorming on our own so that we'd have a hard list of things that we would not budge on. 

You'd think that with six months of engagement already passed, that moms would cool down a bit. Nope. One set of parents, my FH's dad and stepmom, are the best. They have ideas, but they're not pushy. They have generously offered to contribute a sizable amount to our wedding, their talk of who they wanted to be there only went as far as "oh, you're inviting these people? Cool. Sounds good." And they love that our planning so far is about US. 

My dad and stepmom are a whole other ballgame. My dad moved away right after he and my mom divorced about five years ago. We were extremely close, so it was difficult, but he's immature and has quickly distanced himself from his old life, choosing only to see my sister and I when it's convenient to him. He barely answers texts or calls. In the beginning, I used to visit them all the time, despite the two hour drive, and my stepmom seemed interested in helping me plan the wedding. My dad had offered to pay for my dress, but so had my grandmother and my mother and three other people, so FH went with the response that "everyone else wants to pay for the dress, and I don't need 20k of dress and 5k of wedding, so it's a general contribution fund." Then it turned into "Well, we'll help pay, but only if it's for your dress and only if you use the seamstress we used for our wedding." That dress was not good, and I basically just said no thank you. When I tried to confirm with my dad two months ago that they wouldn't be contributing, which I repeated that I didn't mind, my stepmom replied that they wouldn't be, but that she'd like to help plan the wedding, and all kinds of stuff. I don't know. My dad is not going to be walking me down the aisle or anything, I haven't had that talk with him and don't know how to breach that either. 

My mom is an event planner in her daily life, and while I do feel like she has my best interests at heart and she does get a feel for what we want to do with our wedding and is respectful of that, she keeps insisting that we don't need any sort of planner (I agree there) or day of coordinator (I don't want her to have to be doing this and stressing out during her daughter's wedding, also she is unmanageable when stressed out and I don't want her being like that at my wedding). I don't know how to tell my mother Thanks, but No Thanks, that I'll be hiring a coordinator because I can't handle her dramatics. Her SO isn't married, but I love him like a stepfather and honestly, he's been more of a father to me for the last five years than my own dad has. My sister is walking me down the aisle, but if she wasn't, he would be. His daughter (16 now, will be almost 18 at the wedding) will be my youngest bridesmaid and I'm not sure how to handle a bachelorette party with her age. I'm thinking of doing two things but I don't want to leave her out, she's my sister too.

My FH's mother is... Oh man, I don't even know. She's always been extremely opinionated. She pushes this false sense of friendliness but it's very clear that I am not what she envisioned for her firstborn. FH doesn't see how false it is, so I can't bring it up when she says something that's a little underhandedly mean. Even after we told her what we want for our wedding, we know our budget is fairly large, she kept insisting we get married some place she picked out because she's contributing. Well, yeah, so are three other sets of parents and my grandparents, and she's hardly contributing the largest chunk. The worst part is she keeps suggesting weirder and weirder places to get married. First she wanted us to get married where she and her husband got married. They had something like 20 people and that was the max there. We couldn't get away with 20 people if we tried, that wouldn't even include immediate family. It has gotten weirder (get married at the beach! She says. I hate the beach.) and weirder (get married seven hours away! She says. Not happening.) until her last suggestion - that we get married at a local public park. Like, a plain local public park with swings and a slide and little kid's birthday parties. Her reasoning? "It's outside! You guys love the outdoors. And it'll be cheap!" Thanks, FMIL. My FH has a hard time saying no to his mother, so it has fallen on me every time to say "Oh, that's a neat idea. Sure, give me the info and I'll look into it, but I think we're looking for something a little different." I have it down to a science. She looks offended when I tell her we're not going to get married next to a sand pit. 

My maternal grandmother is also contributing several thousand dollars, but she literally could not care less what I do with it. She and I are extremely close, which is good, and she pretty much offered to tell my mom to bug off with the whole "Event planning/coordinator" junk. 

So one set of parents doesn't care what we do, one set of parents isn't contributing because they couldn't pay for my dress (which I know is so that they could SAY they paid for my dress, knowing that the seamstress is not good and very cheap, just for the sake of saying they did that), one set of parents wants to run the show, and one set of parents wants the show to go down in a public park next to a freeway. And my grandma is writing me a fat check and telling me "subject1963, it's well within your rights to tell everyone to f*ck off with their opinions, just because they want to redo their own weddings again and again doesn't mean you have to give in to their dumb ideas." 

I'm having a hard time figuring out how to tell everyone (minus grandma and FH's dad and stepmom) to go screw themselves. I feel like I don't even want to talk about wedding planning with people because it just makes me nervous. I know whatever we go with will be amazing and my FH and I are strong people, but holy crap. We haven't even settled a date and I already want to elope. Not that I could, because I think my mother and sister literally might stab me. 

Anyone with four sets of parents (or three, or two tough ones, or whatever) have any input? How exactly do you politely say "thanks, FMIL, but your ideas are totally not at all what we would ever want and we'd appreciate not having to say this to you anymore" without hurting everyone's feelings? You'd think I could say "hey, this is our wedding and we're going to do this our way" (in nicer terms, obviously) but apparently that is offensive and not okay at all. You all already had two weddings. Get the f*ck out of ours, thanks.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can at least speak for today - I think this was the least crowded summer weekend day I've ever seen. I worked in the parks for several months and have been an AP for as long as I can remember. Most of the lines were ~15 or less. The major ones like Soace Mountain, Racers, etc we're all longer, but it seemed like ONLY those major rides were ever longer than 20. Also, the walkways and stores and everywhere else seemed less crowded. Downtown Disney was almost, dare I say, easy to get through.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Or just remove the downvote button. It works well in other subs and honestly, the discussion in this type of sub is mostly opinion anyway. What we think about this episode/character/ship/storyline. There really isn't enough here that is "irrelevant" or off topic enough for the downvotes button to be anything BUT a "disagree" button. It's like "Here's my opinion/theory about A B and C." The upvotes are "I agree" or "I find this interesting" while the downvotes are mainly "I do not agree". 

And if there's weirdo posts like you mentioned, that kind of thing goes beyond an anonymous downvote and straight into "Report Comment" territory anyway.  </TEXT>

I feel like this sub is so bizarre because there are so many people on here who are only on Reddit for PLL and don't understand how Reddit actually works. It's not a Facebook like button, people. And it's not like that's hard to figure out - it's been said on multiple occasions. 

Ship what you're gonna ship. Do I still ship Spencer with Andrew? And Aria with that guy who punched nails? And Emily with someone far away in CA who is a normal swimmer who doesn't try to drown her? Or Hannah with Lucas (guilty as charged!). Damn right. I also ship them with a few newer partners but... Jesus, these girls need normal relationships where they watch too much tv and fight over where to go to dinner. 

Ezra is still a creep tho.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yup. If I hadn't been drunk when writing the "LIAM GETS IT" post I put up (that was downvoted like crazy, because ~EZRIA (barf), this is what I would have said. That's an awesome point about the actors, too - they are much closer in age so it never really LOOKS weird, which I'm sure alters people's perceptions. In the books, I believe it's A who calls the cops on them while they're at Ezra's place, and he gets full on arrested and charged. Even A (at least in my head) was like "okay, this is fucked up, excuse me while I get your pervert teacher thrown in jail, bye".  </TEXT>

I like it though - so far, I take it to mean that the bravery isn't completely fearless, that there's a strength of mind that backs up the Gryffindor qualities. Think Neville. He was certainly not the picture of the typical Gryffindor hero, he was more subdued. Quick thinkers, not necessarily strict academics. The best kind of person to find yourself with in the middle of a dangerous situation - someone who doesn't just charge in, head first, but someone who can come up with a battle plan while in the midst of things.

<TEXT> "I think you were seduced by your English teacher when you were in high school." 

And

"Try by telling me how you would explain it to yourself!"

THANK YOU, SIR. 

THANK YOU. ~~even if you have douchey nerd glasses~~

I dgaf how many times she says "IT WASN'T LIKE THAT", she was a teenager lead on by a grown man who was secretly stalking her and her friends, to "write a book" about her ALSO teenaged friend who had disappeared and then was probably also around Alison/in her diary before she disappeared?? And also, like, she knew all this but continued to see him/sleep with him because "chemistry" and a bar bathroom make out? 

Liam didn't even need to KNOW the smaller details to know that this shit was way beyond kosher. Thank u bb LIam. Bless. 

And Aria's whole speech about her magic button (cough) and her messy true self and taking all that away is like... No thank you. Liberal emotional awakenings in Iceland do not mean that you can magically erase the ramifications of people being freaked out that you slept with your high school English teacher before AND AFTER finding out he was a lying weirdo who was obsessed enough with your missing/dead sort-of friend that he had a "lair" dedicated to research on her "for a book". 

Also, Spencer's defeated "I got fired!" Whilst falling onto the barn couch with what is probs a whiskey in her hand. Bless. Spencer, even Shady AF Spencer, is my favorite. That is all. 

~~PS am wine drunk right now, if this doesn't make perfect sense in English rn, it makes sense in my head. sorry fam. U da best.~~ </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your situation sounds so much like my old one. The mom worked from home, the dad owned a business that dealt with custom cars. The mom told me it would be all childcare with occasional household chores, but it ended up being "clean the whole house and do all our laundry and also we haven't bottle trained the newborn yet, that's your job, if she doesn't take it I'm going to be upset with you, bye". 

They didn't like dustpans being used when sweeping. You had to sweep everything from the whole house into one tiny corner of the kitchen, and at the END of the day, after the naps because the vacuum woke up the kids, vacuum up the pile. Okay, kind of weird, but sure. The dad came home one day like just after noon, usually home at like 6, and went NUTS because the pile was in the kitchen. I tried to explain that his wife told me to vacuum everything around 4 but he wouldn't have it. It should be done. "A man shouldn't have to come home to a dirty house after a hard day at work!" He had left at 10 that morning. He couldn't have been at the office for longer than an hour. And his wife NEVER backed me up. This dude was weird and the mom was weirder. She'd tell me to do things one way then, when the husband didn't like them, she'd claim that she'd given me totally different instructions. Wut. 

To add insult to injury, they knew I am disabled. We had long talks about it. The mom wanted to be as accommodating as possible. Instead, she would watch me carry very heavy things around the house and not bother to help. She'd literally just watch me. 

I lived almost an hour from them, but there were a shortage of jobs near me so I had taken this job anyway. I figured I could tough it out for the summer and wait for school year jobs to open up. Nope. I drove the full hour to their house one morning with new craft stuff for the toddler. (I usually work with older children, 5-10, and toddlers are weird). They're both sitting at the table looking very serious while the baby is crying on the floor. I'm thinking something really bad happened so I go to pick up the baby and they tell me to leave her. This is super bizarro so I ask what's up and they basically only say "this isn't going to work out. The house is such a mess every day. What did we even hire you for?" Uh. You hired me to take car of your kids. And I spent 2 hours every day cleaning your house even though that's not what we originally talked about. You are all just crazy. 

They paid me cash for my last week. They short changed me. Over the next few weeks I realized the big red flag - they'd straight up told me that they'd had FIVE different nannies. Their daughter had just turned 2. And they didn't get a nanny until she was almost a year old. Five nannies in just over a year. Yeah. It made more sense then. These people are just insane and this is just a game, or the other five got smarter, faster than I did. Derp.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My SO did the same thing, initially. He was a virgin when we met, I was not but had never acted out some of the raunchier stuff I had always thought about. We finally start messing around with it and he's so weird about it - like he'll choke me and it'll get both of us off then he'll talk about how he doesn't like doing it and it feels like he's hurting me. 

On the surface? It's a good thing that he feels that way. But he needs to be willing to have an open, honest discourse about your sex life. It took almost a year to get my fianc to do that.  Once we talked a few times and I encouraged the things I wanted, he warmed up a bit. (We actually, just a few days ago, FINALLY got to try something I've been wanting to try for years. I sort of just had to jump him and make it happen.) 

If he's not willing to talk to you alone, make a therapy appointment. If he does want to talk to you alone, make a point of letting him know WHY these things turn you on. Not just "I like it when you x/y/z" but "I like it when we do these types of things in the bedroom because I enjoy the sexual release of being a bit submissive to my partner". Breaking it down and separating the word "pain" from BDSM talk seems counterproductive, but when you're talking to someone with no experience with BDSM and you tell them about the other facets of control and the dominant duality of a relationship, it can help it from turning into "I'm just hurting her, even if she says she likes it, it's pain!" 

But the biiiiiiggest thing that you can point out to him is that if he doesn't want to do those things with you in the bedroom, he doesn't have to. That you noticed that he seemed to enjoy it at the time, but that if he has thought more about it and decided it isn't for him, that's his choice. He will probably revisit the idea with you at some point but if he doesn't, that's okay too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am sometimes known as ~~that asshole~~ someone who compares every single book to tv or book to movie scene. ASOIAF/GoT has been a rare exception, and that's mostly because my SO's friends roped me into watching starting S02E01. I backtracked, I didn't want to stop watching, etc. So now S06 is over and I am just getting around to reading. 

And I've seen all the posts that say "oh! This scene can be sooo much better explained if you read the books" and I don't like it ~~when other people know more than me~~ when I feel like I'm missing something, so, here goes. 

I'm like 12% of the way through GoT and I loooove it so far. I don't have as much time to read anymore (I quit my boring desk job to be a full time nanny to three kids, thus my reading time has been diminished from several leisurely bathroom/reading breaks per day and an hour after work to a handful of hurried moments with the bathroom door locked hoping nobody sets anything on fire.) I have tomorrow off, so I intend to at least finish another half of this first novel. We'll see. I'm currently ~~wine drunk~~ comfortable in my house with no distractions. 

This season tho. Besides the fact that E10 was amazing (and a fan service wet dream) I feel like this season had me more hyped, more excited, and still more curious than any season before. This sub really got me into the ~~tinfoil~~ finer details and theories regarding future plot lines, heritage, the bigger picture regarding the full setting and the characters. 

I feel like, with winter arrived and Jon looking like he's about to swing Sansa around and be all "Do you wanna build a snowman?!" but also being crushed under the weight of all the responsibility constantly cast onto him, and with Dany crossing over (and also going a little bit crazy! And sapphic! Both of which I appreciate), and Arya really maturing a ton in the past few episodes especially, and fucking Cersei fucking Lannister you fucking insane person... 

Where was I again? Right. With all this happening we're at a crucial turning point in so many story lines. Shit is about to hit the fan. Such hype. I know it's not really plausible to include every book detail, especially given the scope of the novels, so I think it'll be interesting to see the real contrasts. Plus I can't wait another 42 weeks or whatever it is for the next season. So far the only weird thing I've noticed is that most of the characters have non-descript book character voices, except Tyrion, who sounds just like Peter Dinklage. Works for me.

<TEXT> My fianc (27M) and I (25F) have had a roller coaster of a relationship. (4.5 years) Three years ago I was diagnosed with a degenerative spinal condition. I have depression and major anxiety issues. My fianc has stayed by my side, but I have felt like I'm not getting the support I need. I have tried to explain this to him but I don't think he realized how bad it was until this last week. We joke all the time that he's a robot, but he can be really emotionally lacking (weird childhood) and misses a lot of emotional cues (we're in therapy!) which means that I feel pretty neglected sometimes and it has put a strain on us since it can be hard to get the support I need. 

We had an INCREDIBLE vacation last week. A better week than we'd had in years. Got back this last Tuesday. We were hungover and dehydrated and I had a massive panic attack, and I just blurted out exactly how bad all of our problems were and how alone I felt and how I felt like we weren't being good to each other anymore and I hated feeling like this but I felt like we didn't deserve each other. 

He cried. My robot, chrome, rock of a boyfriend actually cried. Which made me cry more. I almost didn't notice it at first but he started sniffling (I thought we just had the same cold) and then wiping at his eyes and then I looked over and he's got tears rolling down his face. And it just... Damn, you know? And there was lots of hugging and lots of realizing we were being stupid and we didn't know why we were being like this lately. We had a huge talk about attentiveness and affection and love. We are each other's best friends. But we'd been neglecting the romance. 

So yesterday, two days after this happens, we have a therapy appointment. And we talk about some stuff and he finally takes it seriously, and it went really well! He's been so affectionate and wonderful the past few days. I think we finally just had this big turning point where we know we need to keep "dating" each other and we're finally remembering all the perfect romantic magical things that make us special. 

We're making dinner tonight at home and thinking of all the good things we're going to do, and things are great! :)

I told them "I didn't do this, you just sold this to me and it's defective" and they were just like "we can't do returns or refunds or exchanges on bottles, its policy."

<TEXT> My fianc and I took our third pilgrimage to EDC this year. Our first was in 2012 (the winds!) and he had bought my ticket like a month after we started dating. Last year was okay, but we had a fight TWO nights and it just didn't feel as special. 

I brought it up to Shane earlier in the day on Saturday - in general, barring obvious exceptions, I feel like the crowd this year was more welcoming, respectful, and loving than either of my prior years. We met some amazing new people, I got a sweet piece of kandi, and since we didn't come with a group this year, we got to just chill out and do whatever we wanted and... Well, and make out all over the place, lmao. The 19th is our 4 1/2 year anniversary, and six months since we got engaged. This couldn't have been a better weekend for us. 

Can't wait to see you crazy fuckers under the electric sky next year! I love you all 3

<TEXT> Definitely. We're staying until sunrise for Galantis, and I'm planning on asking our shuttle staff whose number I can get to call at the end if the access line is five hours long and all that. I'm thinking worst case scenario, we grab an Uber just from the main gate to the outside part of the shuttle lot and explain we just need to get to the shuttle stops. Either way, a wonderful facet of my personality is that I am both good cop and bad cop.  I will ask politely to be accommodated, to a few people, and if not I remind people that the ADA was created for a reason and that I will have assistance or I will sue. *shrugs*  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Same. I feel like we should get people together to give Insomniac some very necessary feedback regarding their supposed ADA compliance, or lack thereof, and what is really needed in the future for this to be a festival that can actually allow people with limitations to have a good time. I mean, the first 10-11 hours were fine. The whole part about walking in circles with nerve pain and a destroyed back at the end of the night? Or waiting two hours for no cart in sight? Not so much. I'm going to access tonight first thing, and letting them know that this is really not a functional program. I know it's insomniac's fault, not theirs, but at the very least I can tell them that they're sending people like 2+ miles out of their way to get to the wrong place.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not much better. We went to Access after sunrise and there was a wait of like 80 people. Couldn't wait that long and decided to take the walk, as long as they could tell me exactly where I was going. They swore that this way that they pointed and told me to turn was the right way. It wasn't. So I walked for roughly a mile before being told that this wasn't the right way. Walked all the way back in, I'm in a lot of pain at this point and it's killing my mood. Finally some helpful person at an info booth told me I could wait another hour for a cart (no thank you, it was already 6:45) or make the walk. I made the walk. I'm feeling it right now but not too bad. I'm just pretty much convinced that getting IN is going to be super easy and getting OUT is going to be a nightmare. Oh well.

<TEXT> Wrapped in neon tape? Like pinkish? If so I think I sat next to you at Circuit Grounds for Adventure Club and part of Eric Prydz! 

This is our third EDC. I've got a degenerative spinal condition so I can walk on my own for short distances but the mile back to the green lot is a no go. And nobody, at any point, told me where to go to get a ride back to my shuttle stop. Access just told me they have shuttles stopping at all the different points on their map and that if one didn't come in twenty minutes, to call. When I finally got picked up ~75 minutes after waiting an additional ~20 minutes at the stop, it was after having to ask at Lost and Found/Info and have them chase a cart down for me. And that cart had two people on it who were just too messed up (insanely drunk) to be able to walk back to their cars, apparently. 

Yeah, there are too many people who take advantage. Tonight I'll just bring my collapsible cane for the walk back and take breaks. Even if it takes me 30 minutes to walk the almost-mile back, and even if it hurts, it'll be better than last nights nightmare. Agh. 

We're taking the Tropicana shuttle. We had no problem getting a ride into the venue, one of the JusCollege people just radioed in and got me and this other guy a cart in. But getting back. Ugh. We left Gate D at 2:30. We weren't able to get to our shuttle stop until after 4:15. That's just ridiculous.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> From the sound of things in the emails I had back and forth with access, this was supposed to be easier than this. 

There have been zero carts by the outside pickup at Gate D. I asked at the info booth and they had no idea. I called the hotline number for access and they said they'd send out a cart, that it would take a while... It's been well over half an hour since I called and 45 minutes since I tried to start waiting where the cart pickup is at Gate D. I'm not supposed to be standing like this for his long and I'm more than a little frustrated. I know Day One is crazy and I'm sure they're super busy but at this point I could have crawled back to the back of the green lot faster than this.  </TEXT>

My FH is a bit of a skeptic and doesn't have a great opinion of therapy, but we're only two sessions in and we don't plan on getting married for a while. I'm glad we have time, because it can take some people a while to come around to the therapy thing and we're going to use the next year to the fullest. I suggest at least trying it out - if you feel you aren't getting anything out of it, there are at-home options that will bring up all the same questions that therapy will.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Rachel got her first Good Girl Justice Boner and I couldn't be more proud. That she was willing to work with Sarah at all said so much for how she realizes this is her problem now too, and she needs to get involved with the right side - albeit in strange ways with cars and Ira the "Abercrombie Model". It was a power play but it wasn't entirely personal, as so many of her previous deeds were. Spending time with Charlotte, especially, has been good for her I think. I also noticed that Rachel seems to have the biggest troubles with her speech when talking to Evie - makes sense because she's under stress, which is undoubtedly hindering progress. 

Also seen: the return of Feral Helena, bless. "You look like roast pig." As she just pats his calf after straight up murdering a dude with a bow and arrow. Blesssss.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My nanny fam is just generally good to me, which is nice. They're also super accommodating with time off, they respect any repercussions I've had to give for the kids, they tell me to stay home and rest if I'm sick, and they're friendly and respectful in conversation. The $500 check for Christmas didn't hurt either, but it's understandable that not every family can do that. Nice cards, stuff like that. The stuff you'd do for a spouse, minus certain aspects :P 

The biggest thing that has let me feel appreciated in this family as opposed to others is respect. My last family changed my pay on me, or tried to get me to do extra chores, and once told me that my job wasn't a "real job". The family before that, the parents were jerks. The kids were jerks too but the parents were worse. They played nice but they tried to get me to do laundry, dishes, stuff they just didn't bother to pick up during their night even though I was only supposed to clean up kid breakfasts. 

Respect. That.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are too many comments here suggesting you get some kind of device (white noise machine/fan/whatever) to cover up the noise. 

NO. Your mother is a grown adult and her involving you in her sex life after you have made attempts to warn her is fucking unacceptable. There are two people you need to talk to about this, and you need to talk to both of them. 

Have your sister call your dad. Have her tell him that you asked nicely, that you tried to give them time at home alone, but that it continues and it is keeping you from sleeping and it's disturbing. 

Then talk to a counselor at your school. Seriously. This could impact your performance and a parent refusing to shut their mouth during sex and keeping a kid up is beyond wrong. Let them know you were living with your dad, I'm assuming peacefully, and that you had to move in with your mom and that this situation has gotten out of hand. Tell them what your mom said: basically "oh well" and refused to quiet down. Tell them that you'd like it if someone could reach out and let her know that it's not okay and that it's affecting your sleep/stress/school performance. 

Don't just let this go and don't let this continue with a fan adding to the noise. This behavior is bizarre.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You were acting immature and left in the middle of your wife's birthday dinner, because you were upset by the behavior of one stupid friend, and you're surprised that they think you were being an asshole? Let me repeat this. 

You left. In the middle of your wife's birthday dinner. Because like a petulant child, you couldn't just be a mature person and deal with some crappy friends. 

And you don't understand why she's upset? 

Look, in the long term, you need to be clear with your wife that she's a different person when around Alex. My fianc had this friend who was similar to Alex and who I hated. His name was Shawn and he was a raging narcissist who kept trying to get my guy to break up with me. They'd been friends for over a decade. It took FOREVER for my guy to see that this friend was miserable and toxic, but it eventually happened. Did I storm out on birthday dinners and snoop through my then-boyfriends phone for information? No. I let him know, over and over again, that this friend was bad for him. He eventually saw what I saw. 

But in the short term (as in, immediately) you need to see that your behavior is only working against you. Alex tells your wife she needs to leave you, Alex is a bitch, whatever. When you act like a child and can't behave like a functioning adult on your wife's birthday, you just prove Alex's point. Your wife starts to doubt you. She's going to act up. And you never realize that it's YOUR behavior that is changing your wife, not Alex's.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> How do I (25F) tell my dad (49M) that his abandonment of my sister (22F) and I 4 years ago is a big deal and that I am devastated by his lies and lack of effort? Do I just cut contact? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-04 01:13:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Title pretty much says it all, but I'll include a few details: 

- My parents were married 20-something years and, throughout my childhood and teen years, became progressively more toxic to each other and to us. They both deal with mostly-manageable mental health issues and they both cheated on each other for the last year of their marriage. My mom left my sister and I with our dad for about 6 months a year prior, but had the balls to kick him out during the divorce. They separated, then divorced almost 5 years ago. 

- They both started seeing other people VERY quickly - within two months. They're both still with those new partners. But my dad moved out to live with the woman that is now my stepmother. They got married within like a year and a half, she has two daughters who are a few years younger than my sister and I. Initially we all got along really well - they're a lot like us, they were really welcoming. All the daughters were bridesmaids in their wedding. 

- My sister got pregnant 3 1/2 years ago. She knew she didn't have the resources and wanted the baby to have a better life, so she found a great adoptive family. Most of our family was so supportive and helpful but my dad and stepmom couldn't handle it.  Mostly my stepmom. They acted like it was a personal affront to them that my sister was "choosing strangers over them" and begged me to make her stop the adoption and make my sister let them raise the baby. This crossed so many lines and went way too far to me and is really the beginning of where the relationship went sour. We see my nephew multiple times a year - probably 30 times over the last 3 years - and my moms side of the family all goes on vacation with the adoptive family. My sister made it clear that, because of the reaction of my dad and stepmom, that when my dad was going to meet the baby for the first time, she wanted him to come alone. At this point he and my stepmom were newlyweds and this was seen as unacceptable to him. Long story short, she has tried everything short of breaking that one rule to get him to meet his grandson. My nephew is now turning 3 and has never met his grandfather. 

- I was always very close with my dad. Despite our toxic family issues he and I were always very close. I got my first tattoo with him while my mom was moved out, we hung out together, I could talk to him about pretty much anything. Once the divorce happened, this disappeared. He barely texted, only called on birthdays. I had to chase after every family dinner or barbecue or movie night. He would go between wanting me to come over all the time and making plans with my then-boyfriend and I to only asking us last minute, after friends had cancelled plans, if we wanted to come out there. And we ALWAYS had to drive out there. He lives 90 minutes away. He lied to his wife about how often he tried to contact us - I showed her my call logs and texts to prove he didn't call or text nearly as often as he claimed - and she still didn't believe me. 

- He treats his stepdaughters so much better than my sister and I. The year he and my mom split, he said he was going to get my sister and I Uggs, which he'd been promising for years, and yes I know how petty this sounds, but he didn't and he kept lying about it and saying they were "on their way". Two months later he bought my stepsisters both new Uggs. We go over most years for Christmas Eve, and all the sisters open presents at the same time. It has become very clear that not only have they decreased in number, but he basically buys us all cheap shit and buys them nice stuff every year. I know how petty that sounds but it's so blatant - they want us all to open presents together but then it's clear there's an imbalance. 

- He has lied about us to most of our extended family, claiming my mom poisoned us and we hated him and only spent time with her (I never even got along with my mom until a year or two ago) and that we ignore his calls and stuff. All lies obviously. He's apparently been telling these lies since the very beginning, and I only know he was lying at all because I ran into my great-aunt and was super happy to see her (she's one of my favorite family members and genuinely one of the nicest people I know) and she was super distant and weird. I asked her if anything was weird and she basically alluded to what my dad had told her. I almost cried in the produce section. I had no idea he'd been lying. I told her I'd just been at his house twice in the last month and for a whole week the month before that. She had no reason not to believe me, so she was obviously confused, and said that she and my great-uncle had had the usual family parties a bunch over the last few years and she'd always told my dad to extend the invitation to my sister and I and my boyfriend. He never did. In fact, he told them that we made up excuses just to not go with him but that obviously wasn't true. 

- I got engaged in December (yay!). In the early years when my then-boyfriend and I were clearly serious, my stepmom and I used to look at tons of wedding stuff, my dad always asked when we'd get married, they were so excited for all of this and we talked about it all the time. When my then-boyfriend was getting ready to propose in December, he drove 220 total minutes in traffic for an hour at my dads house, asking his permission and talking about the proposal. He said my dad seemed strange. Everyone knew it was coming, even what day, so it wasn't shock. He just seemed like it wasn't a big deal. When my now-fianc proposed, we waited until the next day to call everyone. I called my dad and he just said "cool" and that was one of maybe seven words he said to me. The other ones were likely "I'm happy for you" and "Bye Kate". I tried to get him to talk to me but he just... Didn't. He came to the engagement party a month or so later and even helped us move a few weeks after that, but I haven't seen or spoken to him in over three months. New record. 

And then probably the biggest kicker of all... 

My fianc and I had some money troubles a few years ago, when my dad and I were still close. I have a lot of health issues that prevented me from working for a while. The second my dad heard we were having money issues, he wrote us a check (then another later) and insisted we never worry about paying him back. We're talking a little over a thousand dollars. There was also the matter of another thousand dollars - but that was a deal he and my mom made in the divorce. They were supposed to give my sister and I $2k to help get ourselves a car for work and stuff. That was never supposed to be paid back, ever, it was their "apology" for their rough divorce and including us in those problems. But back to the fianc thing, we were super grateful and tried to pay him back but he wouldn't accept it. He was working a job that paid really well at the time. When he lost that job a year or so later (we were given multiple lies about why) he texted me to ask when I could finally pay him that money back. I was floored. I hadn't expected it, even though we'd just started having issues. And I told him that even though the first $1k was car money (he only gave me half what he was supposed to but I didn't really care at the time and was grateful either way) and would not be paid back, that I would work on paying him back as much of the rest as I could. Shortly after that my health issues returned and I couldn't work. Luckily fianc was working a better job and could support us both, but my dad started to get rude with me when I told him why I couldn't pay him back. He stopped inviting me over or answering texts. It was clear this was about the money and I was devastated and disappointed. Out of the blue, right after his birthday, he started texting again and invited us out for dinner. I jumped at the chance. He started inviting us over again after that and I thought things were changed. 

Here's where it gets weird: About six months later I got a new phone and was trying to make plans with him but didn't have his number. My fianc told me to grab his number out of his phone. I could have just gone to contacts but his texts were already open, so I scrolled down to see my dad (I sometimes texted my dad from fiance's phone to say we were on our way over). But there were unusual texts on the phone from just before we'd started talking again. The last two were my fianc asking my dad "can I come by today? I have something to give you." And my dad saying sure, he'd be home all afternoon. I thought it was off immediately and asked my fianc a few days later. He hesitated but eventually confessed to leaving work early one day, taking all the personal cash he had ($700+) and giving it to my dad, to, in his words, "get my dad off my back".  He knew I was so upset by my dads behavior that he freaking paid him off. It says as much my fianc (you damn well KNOW he cares a shit ton about me) as it does about my father, who was ready to cut off contact with his daughter over money he insisted we never pay back and only started talking to me again after my fianc DRAINED HIS PERSONAL CHECKING ACCOUNT. I told fianc that I did appreciate it so so much, but explained that it probably wouldn't help anything long term. My fianc didn't see it at the time but gets it now. He's not a big fan of my dad anymore. 

I've just been floored. I never expected that this kind of shit would happen. I miss my dad. I miss my stepsisters and even my semi-controlling stepmom. But I'm so disappointed and so done trying. I already know he's not walking me downs the aisle at my wedding - that's for my sister now - and I wouldn't do any kind of father daughter dance either. It's sad. My sister was never as close with my dad (she was moms favorite) so I don't think it affects her as much. But it kills me every freaking day. I broke down to my fianc a few days ago. I can't take it anymore. The constant back and forth. Everything. I'm fairly sick. He never checks in or even sees if I'm okay. I called him to tell him I was in the hospital and he never even texted. 

Fianc suggested I send an email just telling my dad how I feel. Telling him how bad he's hurt me and how bad it's been for me, and that I can't be the only one trying anymore. That if he wants to be a part of my life, it's up to him now. But that I've already accepted that he may continue with this behavior and may no longer be a part of my life. 

I don't know what to do. How to say it. I almost don't care. I almost don't want to send it and give him another chance. I can't believe he left. I can't believe he's so obviously stopped caring and that I missed it. I can't believe he took the money. The fucking money. And then played nice for a few months. I can't buy his time. I won't. 

How do I do this? Should I even try? How do I handle the extended family that all think I don't want to see them? How do I make it clear that my sister had given up and that he'll never meet his first grandkid if he can't shape up? How do I tell him he's gone from my best friend to the person who has hurt me the most? 

Someone please help me out here. I'm at wits end. I go between wanting to make one last effort and wanting to just cut my losses and cut contact. But I would lose two sisters and half my already small family in the process. 

Tl;dr (because this was fucking long I know) title + my dad lies to family about me + doesn't seem to care about my health issues or engagement + accepted money from my fianc behind my back that he initially said we shouldn't pay him back and started making a small effort after the money + is generally destroying our relationship. Need help either telling him how he's made me feel and giving him one more chance or cutting contact.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone with a similar BPD/N mom, it sounds like something is up with her meds and stress level. I obviously can't give definitive medical advice without knowing her but the super short swings (some minutes she loves you, four minutes later she's aggressive and back again) sounds like a high stress level that was just exacerbated by feeling left out (she saw the AM time as "special time" with you and didn't get it, on her only kid's wedding day) and feeling like you weren't making it up to her (which isn't justifiable at all, your wedding day and all, but N logic). Is it possible she's switched doses lately? Or that she was eating differently? My friends mom has BPD too and was trying to lose weight for her wedding and it fucked with her, big time. Too many chemical changes. 

Just ignore her for a while. She'll either come around or she won't. I stopped trying to please my mother and she became much more agreeable when I wasn't feeding her that N energy she needed.

It sucks that it had to be on your big day, but it was likely BECAUSE of the stress involved. Don't sweat it too much. And congrats! :)  </TEXT>

My fianc and I have attended EDC twice now - 2012 and 2015, soon to be 2016. We're both super busy (crazy jobs, huge families, I have health issues, etc) so we haven't been able to keep up with pretty much anything - and keeping an updated music library has fallen to the wayside. 

I highlighted the artists on the lineup that we know we want to see. Ones we've kept up with and have the newer stuff or people we've started listening to recently. We don't really have time to go through every single artist, even in the mixed genres we both like.

Given the lineup and an idea of who we like - who should we NOT MISS? Who's got awesome sets or just came out with something amazing? Or who's tried and true and we've just been missing? 

Any help is super appreciated! We're so excited for EDC this year even if we haven't really kept up - gives us time to see more around the festival and catch new artists!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fun fact, I used to submit to a regional literary journal online. I was maybe 19 at the time this whole thing happened. For the most part, people liked my stuff. Yay! I was in a Barnes and Noble one day and heard two women discussing my latest piece from the next aisle over. It was so bizarre! ("No, wait! That's just who I am onliiiine!") But I heard them mention a few things they liked. And I didn't say a damned thing to them. I could have just popped around the corner like "Hey, that's me actually, glad you liked it." But that just seemed fucking strange so I let it go. Plus these were "professional" looking older women - mid 40's. I was wearing sweatpants and I don't think I'd washed my hair in several days. 

A few days later I was on the forums discussing the recent pieces and this user commented and I just KNEW it was one of the ladies from B N. Her phrasing was identical. I decided to fuck with her a bit and asked if she'd been at Barnes and Noble two days ago. And if she was in the green shirt or the black one. She thought I was a total creep at first until I told her I was one aisle over the whole time debating striking up a conversation. Username checked out as obviously being me, we laughed, she tried to figure out which fellow patron I was, she failed. Probably a good thing. There was definitely a coffee stain on those pants.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to work at Disneyland. A certain "lead" cast member who I never got along with liked to harass me one way or another about makeup. If I didn't wear any/my hair was up, I looked "unkempt". But the kicker was when he argued with me for TWENTY MINUTES about how my lipstick was "too dark to be 'look' appropriate." I wasn't wearing lipstick. I was wearing plain, untinted Chapstick. My lips are naturally fairly dark tinted for a really pale lady. 

It took a (higher up) lead walking by and asking why he was yelling at me for the guy to realize he'd been a little over zealous. I had tried to explain that it was Chapstick. I showed him the tube in question. Nope. But this higher lead guy just shook his head and told me to go do my job and he'd handle this dumb guy.

<TEXT> As someone (then 18F) who dated her camp counselor (then 28M) on and off for a while, I seriously mean it when I say it's not as weird as you think it is. My case was actually fairly similar to yours - all the girls in our program had crushes on Richard, he was super sweet, funny, good looking, etc. - and I was surprised that it was me he was interested in. When I was in the program I was 16/17. He waited until I was more than a few months into 18 and we were in different programs at camp to even talk to me outside of camp in more than a "camp friends on Favebook" capacity. We talked about it once or twice and realized it was a depth thing. He would never have considered any of the other girls because that's all they did - bat their eyelashes and flirt and make raunchy comments. He frequently rolled his eyes and made fun of the leader of the girl pack that was the worst - a sort-of friend of mine who bragged about how she thought Richard was checking her out, how she could get him to kiss her, etc. It was during a leadership camp program that dealt with a lot of emotional topics and seeing how different people handled them. He was impressed at my maturity, which is the thing that made him want to hang out with me after camp. 

After we hung out a half dozen times I still had this itchy feeling like something was off - he must have done this with all the girls, or maybe he made some weird assumption about me - nope. He just continued to date me on and off, introduce me to some friends of his, etc. It was all very... normal. All in all, we probably only saw each other regularly for maybe 4 months over two years. I didn't want to be clingy, he worked a lot (worked in Hollywood) but we had unreal chemistry and it gave me the most incredible confidence boost. 

He's probably just as nervous as you are, judging by what you've told us about his actions. But there's zero harm in going out with the guy if you're also interested in him. He may avoid social functions with the big groups because he's just tired of being hit on. And the fact that he was clear about his professional boundaries up front was as much a reassurance as a stipulation - he doesn't want to burden you with feeling like it's weird, and he doesn't want this to ever be a situation where you could be uncomfortable, and he's willing to just drop the subject entirely if you aren't 100% for it or if he sees that things might get weird in any sense. But he was willing to give it a shot and be super supportive to you regardless of what you answered him with. That's respect. Date the shit outta this guy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They definitely won't let in the spray. You might be able to bring in one of the two lip things but it depends on who checks your stuff. Some nights you get someone who inspects the seal on your Chapstick, sometimes you get someone who couldn't care less. I would bring maybe a glossy/shinier Chapstick or a cheap drugstore lipgloss and not risk the real lip products. Sometimes they'll literally just throw it away in front of you. 

Best bet is blotting sheets to keep the oil and sweat at bay and a tinted Chapstick (think Burt's Bees) that you won't mind losing if they toss it. Either way, also bring a real moisturizing Chapstick, sealed. Don't risk chapped lips. Comfort first.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Brief history: myself (25F) and my sister (22F) were raised by a pair of bipolar Ns who frequently switched between being and and Es. Both were on and off medication for mental health issues. I have always been fiercely protective of my younger sister, even though I was the SG and she was the GC and she didn't get picked on much. My parents would get violent but the second they raised a hand to my sister, I physically got in the way. Outwardly we were a great family - active in Girl Scouts and school stuff, super smart kids with a penchant for troublemaking, all very friendly, etc. Our parents worked in tandem - they'd egg each other on. We had many recoveries and relapses that therapy could not fix. Four and a half years ago my parents divorced and I moved in with the guy I'm about to marry. My parents are both still flaming Ns but I don't have to deal with them more than once a month (my mom) or three times a year (my dad, who replaced our family with a nearly-identical-to-us set of sisters and a single mother three hours away). Even after all that crap though, during my childhood my family was very close. We didn't have any cousins or anything so it was just us. We were poor most times and we stuck together, even if it was actually painful. I can't believe I fucking miss that. I miss my family. I miss my violent bipolar emotionally abusive mother and my aggressive opioid addicted father. I miss the good times - the camping trips between phases and the Disneyland days. 

Over the past four years I've held multiple jobs (nanny, personal assistant, cook, waitress, admin assistant, freelance artist, etc.) My current job is the longest I've ever held, at 9 months going on 10. I'm a nanny right now and I generally like what I do, even if my stress levels prevent me from being better at it. I live with my fianc in a tiny one bedroom apartment in the same city I grew up in. Nothing is changing for me. I don't want to go back to school, I don't want a desk job, I don't want to do anything. I feel like the constant encouragement then eventual tear down of any of my goals when I was younger has killed any dreams I've had. ("I want to write for a magazine!" I said. "Do it!" My mom said. "Except you'll be miserable and it's not a real job and it's too hard to get a job in that field", she said.) I rarely see my family anymore, my sister and I see each other every few weeks and text maybe once a week. My fianc and I don't have many friends and we're about to start counseling (which I'm actually excited about) to fix some communication issues. We don't do much - he's overly financially conservative. We're actually going on a vacation I basically just booked and told him about, that I'm excited about. I'm partially disabled (degenerative spinal condition; no cure but mine is progressing very slowly which is cool). 

The littlest girl I nanny for asked me "what are snails even trying to do?". I'm that snail right now. I'm a snail in a target parking lot wondering what the fuck happened that made me realize I have no direction in life. I have become such a boring person. I am bored. I am tired. And I don't even have a reason to be tired because I don't do anything. 

I used to write, and I used to write well. I have nine half-finished novels on my laptop that I'm too ashamed to even open. 

I was basically just given a free pass to go to Target and go shopping because I had a really rough day at work - was late to pick up the kids, who were then misbehaving. I accidentally took their van keys home with me so had to drive half an hour back, then another half hour back to this stupid Target. I could get home in four minutes but what's the fucking point? And anyway, all I bought was Shampoo (I was out) and face wash (also out). I, the girl who can stress shop her way around ten Targets, couldn't be bothered to enjoy anything. Nope. 

So I guess I'll drive home. I still don't know what I'm going to do with my life but at least I don't need to go to a therapist to have the revelation that my parents completely destroyed my psyche.

- Any ride line really (they're not bad for people watching for sure) 

- Going up into the stands to watch it all (this is a favorite for my fianc and I, especially on the side facing Cosmic Meadow - you can still catch a set while you're sitting somewhere not too loud/crowded when you need a break)

<TEXT> I was in Girl Scouts for 12 years - just missed my Daisy year. When myself and two of my old friends joined a new troop after my mom disbanded ours (changed work schedules and nobody stepped up) things seemed great - until the leader started playing favorites towards her daughter and her friends, who were two years older. Long story short, we ended up switching troops. We each had about $1000 in individual earned money - the monetary reward of cookie sales since we opted out of prizes over the years, common in our council - and when we left the leader wouldn't give us our money. She kept it and the next year, when the older girls were trying to decide on a senior trip, her daughter got to go on the trip and also managed to spend her money on a "makeover" before college - and I'm talking like $3k worth of clothes, purses, makeup, the whole deal. Wonder where that $3k of "her" senior money came from. Ugh.  </TEXT>

They mentioned once that it might delay the next set and at some point my SO and I decided to jump ship and just sat in the stands for a while. I was rolling pretty good and the wind felt incredible on me and I remember saying something along the lines of "I'm not even mad, this wind feels so fucking good right now." 

I would have paid decent money to see some girl tripping and asking for piggy back rides. Good on you for helping her out though, I watched shit get chaotic from the stands and was glad I wasn't down there.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My SO and I have rolled together ~10 times over four years. We're very selective users, usually only a really good show or a festival. 

I'm 5'7 and 180ish, F. I take a half pill of anything decent and I roll pretty hard. I am fairly sensitive to MDMA (which is great because I'm a cheap ass). My SO, however, has only really "rolled" maybe twice. Other times he says he feels good/relaxed but nowhere near the same level as I get. He's 6'3 and 220, so that has to have something to do with it, but he also has a hard time getting drunk. He can drink like a motherfucker and be buzzed. The one time he rolled really hard, we split a pill from NL that was super high dosage and were both great allll night. The next time it took him 2 pills to start feeling anything and another one and a half to really feel good. 

How should he dose? I'm not sure on exact mg levels on past rolls because we were noobs and didn't really care. We're about to get decent stuff and split it up ourselves, no pressed stuff this time, but not sure how he should dose so that he can roll hard with me! We're going to EDC in 4 weeks, our first time going without friends, and so stoked to roll together again.  </TEXT>

You don't understand. They're my occasional breakfast treat and they're worth every damn calorie. I've finally also reached that point where I know how to balance and "make up for it".  </TEXT>

<TITLE> SG oldest child - 25F - haven't seen my nDad in months. I was very close with him when I was younger so I'm struggling. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A little bit of background - I'm 25, my sister is 3 years younger. Until I turned 18-20 it was just my parents and my sister. My mom was a vicious, abusive, mentally unbalanced N for my entire pre-teen to Young Adult life. She always took it out on me. Everything. My sister was the GC. She and my mom have always been close. My dad and I were close when I was young - he's a textbook vain/pathological liar N and had some anger issues/was scary but never got as bad as my mom. My mom loved to kick me out of the house, starting around 16, then wait for me to beg my way back into the house. I didn't. Eventually she'd beg me back when it became clear to everyone else I wasn't going to grovel. My dad was almost always my advocate, he'd have these bizarre moments of clarity and back me up or have decent conversations with me. 

When I turned 20, they divorced. It was ugly. It was fucking ruthless. Both of them lied about not having affairs, both of them started behaving totally bizarrely (my mom would have extended Manic episodes and basically reverted to a 16 year old, my dad basically all but disappeared). 

My dad remarried shortly after. His new family is identical to our old one. His wife is like my mom (very overweight, a little gaudy, overbearing/controlling). His daughters are a few years apart and just like my sister and I. They do all the same stuff my family used to do together. At first we all got along great - I'd stay at their house, we went over for holidays, I talked to everyone often. That changed a little over a year and a half ago. My dad has always been a shit communicator but it got to the point that I couldn't get a hold of him without going through my Estepmother. She would make crazy excuses for him, she would say "well he tells me he calls you all the time and you don't pick up!". Bullshit. One time when we went out there, after she'd fed me this line the first time, I showed her my call logs. I don't use my phone to call people often so I had like 8+ months of records. He'd called me once. I'd called him two dozen times. I texted him almost weekly. He texted back four times. When he did talk to me, he'd swear he would tell me when they had a free day, and then ignore my calls for two months. She accused me of lying. She said "well I sit right next to him when he calls you." Who's lying now? Because he NEVER CALLS first. 

My sister had a baby almost three years ago. She was young, it was unplanned. She knew immediately she wanted to give the boy up for adoption. Open adoption, but still. When she told my dad and stepmother, they lost their shit. They told her she was making a mistake, that she'd never see her baby again and he'd hate her, that if she didn't want her child that they'd take him and raise him for her. She was 18. She didn't need that. I told them - firmly but politely - to back the fuck off. That this wasn't their decision to make. Jesus fuck, they wouldn't give up. They called, they cried., they screamed at me and begged me to change her mind. It was an OPEN adoption and my sister and the adoptive mother had been clear that they'd see each other often. We go on vacation with their family sometimes! But that wasn't enough for dad. We see the kid at least every other month, even though they're an hour away. But neither my sister or the adoptive mother were happy with my dad and stepmom when they did this, obviously. He was told that he had to drop this behavior if he ever wanted to meet his grandson. That if he wanted to meet the kid, the first meeting would be him ONLY - no step family. After that we'd introduce more new people. Understandable. My dad wouldn't take it. He insisted his brand new wife, who he'd dated for less than a year, had to be there. That was not part of the arrangement. He would not respect that simple request. He couldn't follow one fucking rule. My nephew turns three next month and he's an absolute joy. My father has still never met him. He doesn't even talk about him now. He avoids him in conversation. 

I got engaged in December. And I realized fairly quickly that I don't want my father walking me down the aisle. It's going to be a hard talk because we were so close and because he's lied to all of our extended family about how we hate him and never want to see him (which I found out by running into my great-aunt in a supermarket and her shaming me. A woman I loved so much as a kid. I just told her there were two sides to every story, that everyone in the family knows my dad is a habitual liar, and that if she wanted to believe that guy over me and my sister, that was her choice.) I called my dad to tell him about my engagement after my FH proposed and he basically couldn't care less. He offered to pay for my dress (but only if I went to this cheap, tacky seamstress his wife went to for her dress that imitates nicer dresses with cheap materials) and then said he'd just contribute. Recently though he backed out again and said they were tight on money but they'd love to help plan. (They just went on like four trips and buy a new car every year, my dad isn't working and his wife sells insurance so yeah they're short on money if they'd living this far outside their means). I'm totally independent and doing all the planning with my fianc. And it's not about the money. I couldn't care less if they contributed. But I texted my DAD to ask if they were planning on contributing and his WIFE texted me back to say they couldn't anymore. A week later after I didn't respond to that, he texted me saying we should have dinner and talk about it. But they want to help plan. No. Also you're tacky. But thanks/no thanks. 

He came to our engagement party in early February and helped us move two weeks later. I haven't seen him since. It's hard. I know he's changed and he basically abandoned us for his new family. I've finally accepted that his initial intentions may have been to combine families and spend time together. But he moved two hours away and never calls me back. He backs out on all his promises and lies to our faces and is never really happy for me. 

I'm not going to chase after a relationship with my father anymore. If he wants to see his biological children ever again, if he ever wants to see his grandchildren, it's his job now. I'm done trying. I miss him so much - how he used to be. The dad that got tattoos with me for my 20th birthday because we were pissed at my mom during the divorce. The dad that built a beer pong table with me and watched stupid shows with me and used to give the best hugs. But he's not that guy anymore.

Oddly enough, my mom has totally turned around with me. I mean she's still a total N but she's actually *almost* pleasant to be around sometimes. If she's bothered by the slightest thing she's a pain in the ass but she actually isn't always awful anymore. My sister still lives with her and we all have dinner once or twice a month. Sometimes she meets me for lunch break on work days. It's actually sort of nice.  

But my dad. Ugh. I'm not going NC. He basically put himself in self-imposed VLC. But I'm giving up. If he wants to keep up that's his thing. But I'm not making any effort for someone who doesn't care anymore. It's just hard. This hurts more than the abuse from my mom did.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually brought up the above book to him and at first he was kind of quiet but then he was like "could I have Asperger's?" And he's curious. So at least I didn't have to breach that question with him. It's likely that it would have been missed in school since, from what I can tell, he was quiet/had great grades/kept to himself and played a LOT of computer games/built and rebuilt his computer often. His family can be a little weird/detached and his mom is certainly the type that, if approached with the idea, would have laughed it off with "my kid? Never!"  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you! GI issues are the worst with weight loss because it's like doctors told me "eat bland! Go eat crackers and bread" and I was just like bruh no this is not working for me 

We really only work out two, maybe three times per week. Usually just cardio for now until I get a little more in shape. I have to be really careful with my back which is annoying but getting stronger will help that. I have a semi-active job 3-4 days a week as a nanny, so 10 hour days chasing a toddler around, walking places, etc. On a work day I easily clock 10k steps. 

But my biggest thing is food and portion control. I used to be so out of control when it came to food, and it isn't good for my body in any way. Eating really clean and juicing for breakfasts some mornings and lots of tea. Little snacks here and there so I don't feel like I'm going to binge the second I see a bakery.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My #1 goal this year was "comfortable but cool". I got a dedicated pair of comfortable walking shoes to be rave shoes that I can get dirty and smushed up, and they are super cool ~Skechers~. Fianc will be carrying a camelbak that we decorate with EL wire to carry shit so I don't have to. For reference, I'm 25F and a curvier girl/size 12. With that said: 

Outfit #1: 
- Little Black Diamond Outlaw shorts in Black 
- LBD Sequin Halter Top
- Hair up in two high buns, glitter+hair gel on my part for maximum trendiness, smoky eye makeup. 
- Black socks, rave shoes 

Outfit #2: 
- Tie-Dye Halter bodysuit that I'm ordering from HarleyMade on Etsy. These are seriously the coolest bodysuits and they can be made with custom colors! I'm just getting a full pastel rainbow! 
- Possibly the LBD shorts on top if I feel too uncomfortable in just the bodysuit. 
- Tie-Dye crew socks also from HarleyMade, rave shoes 
- Hair kinda braided/flower crown (still haven't figured that one out yet) 

Outfit #3: 
- A LBD bodysuit that I wore last year, but this year I'm sewing EL wire onto it in a cool pattern! 
- White crew socks/rave shoes 
- Hair unknown (buns?) 

Still have some tweaking to do but I have 80% of the stuff bought and ready. I tried doing the whole corset/tutu thing once last year and I was so sick of it by the end of the night. Not comfortable at all. My favorite outfit last year was just high waisted stretchy black shorts and a cool galaxy patterned crop top with a thin bralette. I learned. This year is 100% about comfort first.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lol, true that. I just have a hard time figuring out how to make it stick with him. Sometimes I make it very clear that I'm in pain and I need a little support/hugs/whatever and he just doesn't get it. I know that he can't possible understand the pain that I'm in because it's not in his body and I don't expect him to know. That's something we'll have to address in therapy. 

But last week I was in the ER and he was sitting right next to me and I had to keep reaching out to him/asking him to move closer/etc. And since then he's been better, but this was a big issue for us - I'd literally be in the hospital in so much pain and he'd be sitting ten feet away, distracted, saying "There's nothing I can do to stop your pain". Well, yeah, but you can make me FEEL better, and he wasn't understanding the difference. 

I see your point about addressing it beforehand though. I probably need to give him a clearer heads up, i.e., we're at work during the day and I'm in pain, instead of just saying "Ugh I have a ton of nerve pain today" and thinking that's enough, I should probably rephrase it to something like "hey, heads up, I'm having a lot of nerve pain today and will need a hand with the dishes/will need some more comfort and care" kind of thing. Thanks.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, we both knew before this even that we've got some issues we'd like to iron out before actually getting married. We're not planning on getting married for at least another year, so this IS that time for us. We are genuinely happy together, we just do have some things to iron out over the next 12-18 months. This therapy for us isn't so much "omg we need to go to therapy to save our relationship" so much as "we need a neutral third party who can help us find better ways to thrive in this relationship". I have a very healthy idea of therapy, I've struggled with anxiety and depression for a while so I'm not turned off or worried by the idea of therapy on its own, I'm actually excited to see what it can do for us. I think it took him so long to agree to therapy because his mom/family has a very twisted idea of mental health and 'getting help'. (His mom once said, matter-of-factly at the dinner table, that people with mental health problems shouldn't be allowed to own guns or have children. She doesn't know about my depression/anxiety. No grandchildren for her then I guess.) He's finally seeing that it's a tool, not a life raft, which is great. 

I'll have to check that out. It's weird but over our conversations about this, I have thought about the similarities between my FH's behavior and Asperger's. I've never brought it up with him because it's not really my place, I'm not assuming he has it or anything and that's the kind of thing we can work out in counseling, but a good friend of mine was in a LTR with a man with Asperger's and their reactions/behaviors are strikingly similar.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> My [25F] fiance [27M] of 4 mos, partner of 4.5 yrs, has major trouble with emotional cues/sensitivity. Took months for us to reach this conclusion and unsure where to go from there. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A little context: I'm 25, a full-time/salaried Nanny for three great kids, I have a number of health problems but for the most part, I'm alright. He's 27, Software Engineer, had never had a girlfriend (or even kissed anyone) before me. I met him through friends of friends at a party. I had actually casually dated one of his friends for a while, it wasn't a secret, but long after the friend and I stopped seeing each other, I met my now fiance and we immediately hit it off. He seemed shy and I'd seen him around but never talked to him before. I continued to think he was just "shy" for some time, and during the honeymoon phase of our first year or so, it was just that. I was diagnosed with a degenerative spinal condition two and a half years ago, it isn't progressive thank goodness but it still causes a lot of pain and problems. We've always had a great sex life, even though sometimes we go a week or so without it. 


After that first year, I feel like we've just had so many minor communication problems that have acquiesced into something far worse. When we fight, or when I express that I'm upset over something he's done, he tends to stonewall me and just totally tune out. He won't even look at me while I'm talking, and I have to sit there in silence for a solid minute and let him think then prompt him with a "What are you thinking?". He just doesn't know how to talk about things that are bothering us, he doesn't know how to apologize. We both get pretty defensive when we argue, we both know that, but sometimes it's like talking to a brick wall. He's said some pretty insensitive stuff in the past (that my job isn't a "Real" job because I make roughly 1/3 of what he does, stuff about how emotional I get, etc) that is pretty hurtful. We make jokes about him being a robot but it's not so much humor as it is a ridiculously accurate statement about the state of his emotional IQ. He just has no idea how to handle emotional situations anymore. I feel like the initial rush of endorphins at the beginning of our relationship showed me this caring, romantic, loving guy, and that guy has slowly slipped away. He seems to think about everything in black and white now, and it's getting frustrating. 


He's made comments about my weight indirectly. We are both trying to eat healthier and lose weight, he knows I'm really uncomfortable with my body, but he seems to think that it's "helpful" to make comments that are sometimes rude about something I'm eating/doing/talking about in reference to getting healthy. Harsh comments about "are you really going to eat that?" and stuff like that, which he doesn't mean to be harsh - I know this - but that are really insensitive, and he doesn't understand why. He just sees it as a roadblock to progress. 


We had a huge talk this last weekend about him shutting down and what he does in these situations. We had sort of an awkward night before (tmi: we were trying to spice up our sex life with a little "game" and we didn't communicate fully what the goal was, so things got awkward really fast when we both got confused) and I just wanted to talk through it so that we wouldn't entirely abandon the idea of making things interesting in the bedroom. At first the conversation went okay, we started talking about a few other things that were bothering us, he seemed to at least be verbalizing, but then he just started shutting down before we could reach any real conclusion. When I thought he'd just reached the end of his communication rope and tried to end the conversation with a kiss and makeup sort of strategy, I just sort of went over what we'd talked about ("I promise I'll just ask next time" and, from him "You need to just tell me to my face immediately when I'm being insensitive"). We were sort of joking around after cuddling, as we are known to do, and he was like "You need to just call me on my shit." I was like "I will try! And you need to call me on my shit too!" (re: dishes, at which I am a known procrastinator) All of the sudden he loudly just says "I can't call you on your shit, you just yell at me and there's no 'right' way to bring things up with you." 


Long story short, this is a concern he's had for a while that is completely justified. I grew up in a difficult household, lots of yelling and blaming and problems, so I'm used to confrontation when it comes to household chores, he's not. If he asks me to clean up a mess I've made, I'll usually put it off. Sometimes, though, he asks when he knows I'm having a lot of pain that day and can barely walk. I think of this as insensitive, considering I need help getting up the stairs to our apartment, how on earth am I supposed to be picking up the bedroom and the living room? Why can't it wait until tomorrow when I feel better? So I get defensive because I HURT, I am in physical pain, and he is acting like I'm just gaffing off. 


So the argument doesn't end well again, and we start talking again, and then he just goes dead silent for several minutes. I can tell he's thinking hard about something, I know this about him, so I let him think. And then he tells me that he knows something is wrong with him. He sees how upset I get when he gets harsh or gets weird and he knows that this is not normal, but he doesn't feel like what he's saying is wrong. He's not defending himself at all, he's just saying that he knows this behavior is wrong, and he knows he's probably being insensitive, even if he doesn't see it at the time. His (almost) exact words were "I feel like I'm missing so many emotional cues that you give me, so I'm upsetting you and being a dick because I just don't understand what these cues are and how to read them." I want to say "well, I tell you when I'm in pain and I've asked you to stop commenting about health stuff approximately 11 billion times" but I don't do that. I know he's trying to fix this. And I know that in the past, I've hesitated to bring up things he's done wrong (I was in a long term emotionally and physically abusive relationship a few years before him, so I still have that mentality at times that I don't want to do anything that could upset him).  So I try to ask him for examples. He brings up our biggest problems - his harsh comments, his lack of empathy, etc - and I feel like we're finally getting somewhere. We agreed that we'd do some research into fixing this (he's going to read a few books, do some research on emotional disconnects in relationships, etc, and I'm going to do the same) and we're going to look into therapy. 


We love each other so much. We got engaged a few months ago and we know we're going to get married and have weird children and it's going to be great. But he's finally admitting that he needs some help re: communication and I'm just so at a loss with where to start. What books should we be reading? What articles? What should we actually put into practice as far as trying to "call each other out" and be plain about when he's upsetting me? I know I could literally turn around and say "You're being an asshole" and he'd be fine with that. But I don't want to make him feel bad about it, I really don't. I want a way that will bring it up to him respectfully but honestly enough that he takes it seriously. I have a hard time standing up for myself and saying "What you just said is really rude" or "You need to lay off because I'm in a lot of pain and you're being an asshole" so it's been building up. I didn't give him big enough cues, he missed them entirely, but the things he said - regardless of cues - were a bit harsh. 


Wow. That ended up way too long. Thank you for reading through the whole thing if you got this far. I'm just at a point where I know we're going to have to put some hard work into this, but I don't know where to go from here. I desperately want us to be better at this communication thing. 


**tl;dr**: Fiance and I have communication issues because he's basically a robot, we had a conversation and he admitted he's lacking emotional intelligence/sensitivity and he doesn't know how to fix it. Wondering where we can start re: books, articles, research before we go into therapy soon so he can see this laid out logically/scientifically and if anyone has any ideas for how to better our communication in the mean time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No matter what you wear, aim for comfort. I've had outfits that I go all out - corset, tutu, etc - and it's just uncomfortable and it gets really annoying. Never again. My favorite outfits have been the comfiest - high waist black stretch shorts and a cool crop top, and a bodysuit. 

I get 80% of my rave wear at Little Black Diamond. Their stuff is so comfortable and usually really flattering. My bodysuit was from them, my crop top was from them, and this year I have a full outfit that's LBD. Prices are a little higher than some but the stuff is good, they have great customer service, and stuff doesn't take a month to get there like some sites. (PS I'm technically a little bigger than their size chart says they fit, but their stuff fits me no problem. So their sizing is flexible, if anyone is wondering.) 

This year: 

1: LBD Black Outlaw shorts and LBD Sequin Halter Top, comfortable running shoes. Hair up in two lil buns with a glitter part because I am a trendy fuck. 

2: Last year's LBD bodysuit, but I'm going to sew EL wire into it so I light up! Comfortable running shoes. Maybe also lil buns with glitter part. Because that sounds a: cool and b: literally cool, keeping my curly hair off my neck. 

3: Tie-dye bodysuit I'm ordering from HarleyMade on Etsy. Tie-dye crew socks. Comfortable running shoes. Flower crown, hair braided up a bit to keep it up.

<TITLE> First Goal Achieved: Onederland and no longer Obese! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-15 20:19:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all! So, hitting Onderland wasn't as big of a success for me as it is for some people - my start weight was 203. Two weeks ago I dipped under 200 and then I didn't weigh myself for two weeks for various reasons (see below). 

F/25/5'8"
SW: 203 
CW: 196.8
GW: 125

So my fianc and I started being healthier almost exactly a month ago, started going to the gym straight after work, etc. We've been on and off the wagon for the last two years but this is IT. 

Then two things happened: 
1. A car ran through the front window of our gym, which closed it for several days (it just reopened) 
2. I was in the hospital briefly for health issues (of which I have many: degenerative spinal condition, GI issues, cluster headaches, and more!) 

So I haven't been the best over the past two weeks. In fact, we've been eating just slightly better than we used to. 

But I stepped on the scale this morning to see that I'd lost 2 pounds in the past 2 weeks (less than before but still awesome!) and when I went to track my BMI, I realized that 

1. I've been solidly back in Onederland for two weeks and 
2. As of this morning's weigh in, I am no longer in the Obese BMI range! 

#2 was my first real goal. And becoming Obese was the kick in the pants for me. I'd always been overweight (since middle school, when I developed much faster than anyone else my age and my metabolism dropped out) but Obese was not good. My health and my body can't handle Obese. I know there's a possibility the scale will tip back up and I might cross back over, but I'm going to do my best to make sure that doesn't happen! 

We just found out yesterday that our gym reopened the day before, and we're also starting a Whole30 today (we've done one before with good results and feeling better, meal prep day is today) so I'm hoping I can get these losses back up to speed and kick some butt!

<TEXT> Fianc and I are doing more this year than last year - in previous years we've stayed at a vacation time share thing his mom does so we only paid like $100 a week for hotel. This time we're staying on-strip and doing a shuttle instead of driving, so... 

For two people, six nights seven days: 
Tickets: ~$800
Hotel: $1000
Shuttle: $178 
Food: we're planning on bringing protein bars for "breakfasts" and eating lunch and dinner out on non-EDC days, so ~$400
Alcohol: $40 
Other: $100-150
Extra show: $60 (maybe)
Merch, souvenirs, incidentals: $200 

Low end? $2500. High end? $3000. 

Annnnnnd now I'm glad tickets, hotel, and shuttles are already mostly paid for. Still have like $200 on hotel. We're like 3/4 paid for. Whew. 

We've been together four and a half years and somehow we've never taken a full week vacation just us. It's always with family for a week or a long weekend just us. We decided to "do it big" (as big as our budget allows) and take a real Vegas trip as grown ups. I'm so fucking excited you guys. Not worrying about trying to meet up with people between sets is going to be amazing.

<TITLE> Rude parents at the middle daughters school said something awful about her. Don't know if she heard, wondering how I should bring it up to her mom if at all. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-14 01:13:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I work for a family with three kids (9M, 7F, and 3F) in an affluent suburb in Southern California. This is a town of designer shoes, stay-at-home moms, and an educational foundation for the small local schools that pledges upwards of $5,000,000 per year. This is new money, fast cars, bad attitudes. I got extremely lucky with the family I nanny for. They're well off, from what I can tell, but unlike so many around here they're super down to earth, funny, and relaxed. They make fun of the crappy people in the neighborhood with me. Their kids are all amazingly smart, funny, warm kids who (despite normal kid acting out) are honestly a nanny's dream. I make decent money playing silly games and going on adventures. 

The middle, we'll call her Sparkles, is 7. Sparkles is a 7 year old girl, and that comes with the normal set of bizarro behaviors and odd dress sense. She can be sensitive, she can be a brat, but mostly she's just a living personification of a rainbow and I adore her to death. 

However, in this neighborhood, she tends to get picked on. It's not super obvious because it's only really been happening over the last few months, but her group of friends has started leaving her out and saying a few rude things. Girl drama is girl drama. But these kids are different, and the moms get involved. The girls are dressing nicer, maturing a little faster, all egged on by the parents. 

Sparkles has a very... Unique sense of style. Her mom certainly doesn't pick out her outfits, like some of these kids. For example, one of the first days I worked for them, she wore a Steelers jersey, a pink lacy skirt her grandma sewed for her, striped leg warmers, and water shoes. She just wears things, she's not super concerned with how it looks. 

She's also very sensitive but also fairly strong about it. If someone says something that she thinks is unfair, or not nice, she just ices them for up to several days. Straight up won't look at this person. And while sometimes her other "friends" will talk to her, sometimes they don't, and she has a hard week because nobody else will play with her. 

She's fairly confrontational but also prone to much crying. She picks at her face and does gross stuff and can be a little... Creepy. She really is just this sweet innocent kid. And while I know her mom knows about at least most of this, today one of the moms said something that I think is inexcusable for an adult to say about a child. 

Sparkles was running around the school lawn right in front of me with her sister while we were waiting for the brother to get out. One of the moms turns to me and starts talking about them. We talk about the talent show that happened two months ago, where Sparkles did a silly dance routine with her big group of ~15 friends. The mom expressed surprise that Sparkles is such a happy, silly kid. She said she was surprised at how much Sparkles' personality came out on stage and how cute it was. I was just about to gush about how much I adore her because she's so unique and she treasures her individuality when the mom says, verbatim: 

"I mean, I know nobody else really likes her. They just feel sorry for her because she's weird. It's good to see she can still smile." 

Uh, WHAT? This is a first grader you're talking about. A seven year old girl. How would you like it if I told you nobody likes your kid and they all pity her? I kind of gave her a look like "do you realize what you just said?" And reiterated that Sparkles is the sweetest kid I know. Then got up and walked away. 

I know what she said isn't entirely true - Sparkles was invited to her friends house this afternoon and she's there now. But she said it so matter-of-fact and so blithely, right in front of the kid. I'm not sure if she heard or not - she's the kind of kid who would ignore it to save face and then just melt down later. But I'm 80% sure she didn't. 

On the chance she did, though, I'd like to maybe warn the mom re:what was said and by who, so that if she's in a particularly crappy mood later, she can figure it out quicker. But how do I say that to a mom that values and encourages that originality? 

My heart breaks for this poor girl because I was in her exact position when I was young - I had a huge group of girl friends who ditched me for my weird dress sense and dumb jokes and went on to become the popular girls. It was hard. I remember how much it bothered me, for YEARS. ITS SO SAD. She's such a sweet girl and in any other class of neighborhood she'd just be quirky. Here she legitimately gets picked on, even by grown adults, and I have a feeling that she puts on a brave face but I know exactly how sensitive she can be. 

Has anyone had this happen before? How did you handle it?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, as someone who has been in your girl's situation, let me give some advice. It's going to be longer but I feel like there are some things I agree with re: her behavior and some things that are a red flag. 

My fianc and I have been together four and a half years. He hadn't ever had a girlfriend before me and spent a lot of time with his family. I had some tough family stuff growing up and my parents went through an awful divorce right around the same time he and I got together. 

I wouldn't say my fianc is especially close with his family - they aren't really emotional, they don't really do things on holidays, etc. But they make plans. All. The. Time. Constantly. Towards the beginning of our relationship we were seeing his family maybe four times a week. FOUR A WEEK. And even though that was only a few weeks, it still got on my nerves. It's not that I don't like his family (his step dad is funny, I love his sister to death, his mom can be pretty overbearing but whatever) it's that I felt like he often would say "yes" any time his mom asked. And to that point, it does turn into a girl vs family kind of thing - did you ever say yes or make plans that might involve her without talking to her about it? My fianc did that. He just assumed it would be fine! We were free Thursday, right? And Saturday? And... Yes. We were free. But that's not how a SO really wants to spend their time - tons of time with the other family. I felt like he couldn't say no to his mom, even at my expense, and that we were missing out on other plans or quality time because his mom always came first.  

And coming from a tough background, I can tell you that it's extremely weird being around "healthy" families. It doesn't make sense to those who haven't been there, but it's so weird. We're always on edge, expecting a fight or an offhand comment or some kind of meltdown. It's so so uncomfortable because I know these are people he loves, but if I see them so much as disagree, I tense up and assume bad things are happening. 

Does it make sense to other people? No. But it could also be the case that someone in your family said something to make your girl uncomfortable and that you either missed it or didn't see that it made her uncomfortable, or that it wasn't meant to be harmful. I would obviously assume that your family aren't awful people. My fiancs family isn't awful. But they have some views that they've voiced once or twice that are horribly offensive. I have a history of mental illness (stemming from, guess where? My family!) and have been on and off medication and in and out of therapy since I was in elementary school. His mom once proclaimed that people with mental illnesses shouldn't be allowed to own guns or reproduce. That they should pretty much all be locked up. She sees the issue very black and white and obviously doesn't know about my problems, so while it was one thing that she said in the middle of another conversation like three years ago, it still bothers me. 

When I met my fianc he didn't seem conservative at all but it has become clear that his parents are conservative to the core. This includes a belief set I strongly disagree with. 

See this problem? I have very serious issues with their personalities and alignments. They can be very cool people and I survive a dinner now and then. But one line from his mom, along with a few other hints here and there, things that wouldn't be particularly offensive to others, is something that tarnished my views.

I'm not saying that this is what happened with your girl. I'm saying it's definitely a possibility and she doesn't want to bring it up with you, because who says "hey! I know you love your parents but I think they have no soul." So she just avoids them when she can.  

Whether it's just being uncomfortable or if she's had another issue that you may or may not know about, there's clearly a problem. She may feel like you're choosing them over her. I can relate. 

BUT. I think she needs to be a little more flexible. For example - my fianc used to have phone calls with his mom for kind of a long time. She'd call him out of the blue and he'd talk to her for half an hour, and meanwhile I'd be waiting for him to help me start dinner. Or he'd stop a show we were watching to call her or to answer her call. 

When I moved in with my fianc and we started having our own routine, interruptions to that routine seemed awful. I just wanted to be free from family ties, given my history, and to be able to live my own adult life with my partner. 

Is she right to tell you NO? Not at all. She needs to compromise. Consider sitting down with her and adding a compromise - if you're going to do less with them in person, and only see them every other week, she needs to give you at least once or twice a week to call them and catch up. Even if it's just a fifteen minute call after work. You need to stand your ground on this, because I know how tough this can be for her and she will try to fight it. Tell her you are not willing to completely give up your parents. You need to be able to see them and speak with them. If you need to set plans in advance, do that. This is what helped me - at least 48 hours warning for a dinner or something so I didn't feel like he was pressuring me to say yes to a dinner that night after we'd already talked about having chicken/sushi/whatever. My big problem was that I felt like any verbal communication we had surrounding that specific day was a "plan" and any interruption to that plan was him choosing anyone else over me. If we talked about going out for Sushi on Friday, he learned not to ask me to change that. I like having routines because I was in a very chaotic living environment with my family for 20 years. I like order and rules and set times. 

Has your girl gone to therapy for any of her family related issues? It helped me immensely to see why I was feeling what I was feeling. And to help me find what I would be comfortable with. If she doesn't want to do that, fine, but it might be helpful for her to talk to a friend or even get on Reddit to hammer out some of those issues and have a sounding board on this matter that isn't you. 

That's the other issue here - you need to be able to compromise and stick to the rules that you guys discuss. You're not willing to give up family, but you'll see them x times per month and be able to call them x times per week. Anything beyond that needs to be approached carefully and in advance. Or not at all. You're completely disregarding her discomfort. It is hard to balance family life as you get older and live out of the house with a partner. That is true of almost every relationship. But as much as you think this is stupid, you need to realize you're making her uncomfortable when you force her to accept family stuff. 

If she's unwilling to compromise? That's a problem. And you need to reassess the relationship. But if you sit down with her and tell her that you are willing to make a compromise but you won't give up your family for her, she'll either work with you or she won't. And if she doesn't, get out of there. It won't get any better.  </TEXT>

He's really only rolled twice, other times I swear he's got to be feeling it because he behaves a bit differently but he doesn't feel it so much. He usually needs a higher initial dose and like two redoses, sometimes three if he splits them up. 

A friend of mine from high school found out he was metabolizing things so fast that by the time he finished drinking, he was already feeling hungover. He'd be miserable before he even went to bed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This was happening to me - I stopped using brushes with this foundation and moved exclusively to a beauty blender. The formula is matte and sets fairly fast/it's pretty thick, so if any time passes between blending foundation and then trying to smudge something else into it... Patches. 

So I typically pat on any color correcting stuff, then tap concealer anywhere that needs to go, then tap the foundation on last. Tap tap tap. Blending with a brush with this formula didn't work well at all but once I started using the BB, it was flawless.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Illness/Duration: Syringomyelia, Fibromyalgia, Cerebro-spinal trauma related issues, Arthritis (possibly rheumatoid), Migraines, Cluster Headaches, Renal Cysts, Liver problems, and undiagnosed malabsorption problems. 

2. Tracking of various symptoms. I don't need an app so much for medication management because I don't take a ton of meds, I just need something that can track my symptoms and keep it all in one place. 

3. Tons! It would be nice to be able to add custom symptoms. I.E. Sleep and exercise by hours, temperature by degrees, urine output by color/volume/frequency, responses to digestive issues (like a check list of qualities based on output), a way to track types of headaches and their attributes (rather than just a pain scale, some sort of multi-step thing including region and type of pain, check the WebMD symptom checker if you don't understand what I'm saying). It would be nice to be able to track depression and anxiety type issues too - tracking mental health symptoms would be a god send because I get so brain-foggy that sometimes I don't remember things. Also, tracking that. How's memory? Etc. For women with things like PCOS, there's a horde of issues. I think your best bet here might be some kind of custom add feature for symptoms since so many people need to track different things. 

4. Yes! I don't like carrying around a physical notebook and I'm fairly lazy about tracking my symptoms. 

5. Social would be a big part of it, but being able to print out a sheet with pertinent information to bring to my various doctors would be amazing. 

6. Reddit, Facebook support groups. There are no local support groups for my neuro condition so it would be nice to be able to talk to other people outside of typical social media. 

7. A forum-type thing might be easiest, but a chat feature for one-on-one or multi-member chats would be good too to form a sort of virtual support group. 

8. All the trackers. And printing everything out.

9. 25F 

10. City, and yet somehow my nearest support group for one of my conditions is in the next state. I live outside Los Angeles.

<TEXT> Hiding my foul language inside the actual post. 

Fucking hell. 

After years of bizarre pains and headaches I was diagnosed with a spinal condition called Syringomyelia. Basically I have a fluid filled cyst within my spinal cord. Nerve pain, problems, numbness, problems, blah blah blah. It's been almost three years since then. Not dead yet. Haven't progressed too much, which is freakin' sweet. Still have pain, it's chronic and there's no real "treatment" other than risky surgery, but mine is not debilitating. Awesome. 

Okay, so I also have asthma. I've had breathing problems since high school. I just carry an emergency inhaler. Nothing too bad. 

I also get insanely painful headaches and migraines. There's a multitude of things that can cause one to set off on a day to day basis, but I switch between orbital migraines and cluster headaches. Super. Just great. (If you can't yet pick up on the sarcasm... WHOOSH) 

So lately I've been having... Digestive issues. Tl;dr, my stomach is behaving bizarrely and my movements have changed. I feel like every time I eat I'm in pain and I have ('scuse me for saying this) gnarly gas, and then I have problems continuously. If I literally stop eating for ~12 hours it briefly goes away, then comes back. 

So today I go to the ER because my stomach is in knots and cramping so hard I can't breathe. Also I threw up blood. So there's that. The doc tells me A: you probably have multiple food intolerances. I know I'm lactose intolerant but I don't know about anything else yet. She suggested gluten (ack) and soy (nooooo my soy milk) but possibly also an allergy of some sort. I am pretty much always feeling like crap so I wouldn't doubt it. 

She then asks if I want an ultrasound to make sure nothing else is wrong. I mention that I had an abdominal ultrasound about a year ago (similar crampy pain in stomach that was never resolved) and that the test results only ever said "irregular result" near my stomach. Okay. She frowns. Then she sends me for an ultrasound. 

Bingo! There are two fairly large cysts on my right kidney. She has no idea what the ultrasound tech did last time but clearly these things are bothering me. There's also slight inflammation in my liver. A combo of these things can mean that my stomach over-produces acid? Renal Cysts + Liver Inflammation + essentially GERD = happy fucking Wednesday. 

So essentially only my giant stupid nervous system and my weird lungs (one is shaped funny, no clue why) was affected before, but now also my other organs are being dragged into this. Thanks, body.

<TEXT> Girl, I am a total hourglass shape, plus some chubby legs. And I wear booty shorts like nobody's business. It's like nine trillion degrees even at night out there. Nobody is going to judge you! We're a great crowd. Focus on not sweating to death. My first year I was so self conscious but honestly once you get there you'll see. No reason to be worried! :) just get something good for the chub rub (I suggest body glide, I replied to a comment on here too) and you'll be golden. 

Personally I've got two pairs of booty shorts I'm wearing, and a bodysuit that's not suuuuper booty but certainly not something I'd wear in the real world. I'm comfortable, I feel cute, win win.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fianc and I have lived together 4 years - and pretty much since the beginning have split things by percentages. We have about the same wage gap you do, slightly different. I make about 1/3 of what he makes, so we take all our bills and multiply them by that ratio to get our monthly contributions. 

We also figured out a weekly budget based on a normal spending week - groceries, gas, home supplies, restaurants, etc - and split that total number by our ratio again, so we're contributing a fair amount to monthly and weekly expenses. With whatever is left, we pay for our personal expenses and contribute to savings accounts. 

My fianc keeps saying he wants to write an app for couples budgeting following a similar model, but totally customizable. I keep showing him posts like this to prove there's at least somewhat of a market for it!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you really can't access the registry/are worried about doubles, just ask the bride. I'm sure she'd be more than fine passing off the info, and once you purchase something from a registry, it shows that it's been purchased so she doesn't get doubles. 

If that doesn't work out? Buy her something small and physical (wine/etc) and then either a big gift card to wherever she has her registry (so she can buy the remaining things that nobody bought her) or give her a check. It's totally acceptable nowadays, especially from a casual relationship like work friends. And she can either use it for honeymoon stuff or wedding expenses.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ugh, I'm so sorry. The parents really just have no clue sometimes. 

I started a prior gig in June. I had been working two nanny jobs because I was on contract with one family until Mid-June and the second family really wanted me to work for them, so I was splitting shifts. It was insane. It was almost an hour commute each way to the second job. They started asking me to do things that were NOT part of the initial agreement (doing the parents laundry, cleaning the entire house, etc) and I did my best to keep up while really only working for them ~6 hours a day and the other family another ~7 hours a day. The first family, at the end of the contract, ended things on a good note. We'd had problems here or there but we hugged, it was sad, etc. 

The very next week I was going to be able to focus full time on this second family. Instead they had me drive an hour+ to their home, where they had the kids, to fire me on the spot because I "just wasn't keeping up." They knew and encouraged me to finish out my previous commitment and had SEEMED super understanding about the double job thing. Nope. No warning. And then they had the guts to complain about how they'd have to take time off work, and this was so inconvenient to them, blah blah. It had been like four weeks. They had barely given me a chance. 

Some parents, no matter how nice they seem, are jerks. They see you as an employee and nothing else, and they'll squeeze you for your last minute if they can. 

You'll find something better. I certainly did. I'm so sorry this happened to you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I second this foundation! If you're used to a thinner foundation it can take a use or two for you to get used to the feeling, but I love it. I am an absolute oil slick and this is the ONLY foundation that stays on my face all day. I'm wearing it right now. I applied at 10 this morning, it's 6 hours later and it hasn't budged. My old foundations used to melt off like this within an hour or two. 

Also, don't skip the hydrating primer. The combo of the hydrating primer and the EL have been my HG. I tried the hangover primer with it once and my skin looked so. freaking. good. Este Lauder will give you a sample of Double Wear that's good for a few uses and shade match you if you go to their counter. 

My other thing was powder - i found that a brush wasn't properly integrating the powder into the foundation, so it tended to look weird on me. I switched to Laura Mercier pressed powder and I use a powder puff to press the powder into the skin. So much better and it looks so smooth.

<TEXT> Cover FX makes custom cover drops - you can get a shade that's closer to your tan skin, maybe even a little darker, and just adjust the number of drops as you get darker. It won't change the texture of your foundation too much and you can use them for a liquid bronzer when you get pale again in the fall. A few other brands make drops like that but Cover FX are the best formula IMO.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Nmom chooses today to tell us that she apparently almost died in a plane crash?? Then brings up a mortifying habit I had as a teen in front of the whole family. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-09 00:23:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So... My mom. 

My abuse was 85% emotional/psychological torture. 15% physical. I was kicked out and begged back multiple times. Moved out when I was 20 (am 25 now) to be with then boyfriend, now fianc, because A: he realized my home life was shitty and B: he'd never had a relationship before and we didn't want to leave the bedroom much. Heh. I went VLC for several months, then LC, and still limit contact to a point but mostly I just leave a conversation/situation if she starts going off about weird shit. 

My sister (22, GC) still lives with my mom. Today we got together for Mother's Day and had a little mini brunch - minimal effort. Bagels and fixings, champagne and orange juice. My grandma came too. She's a good deflector/redirector when it comes to my moms shit. 

My mom decided to choose today to tell us that, prior to my birth, while she was working for an airline and flying every other week to visit my dad on base, she missed a plane once and that plane crashed at the Denver Airport and everyone on it died. 

The quote to end this story? "So if it wasn't for me, you wouldn't even have been born!" 

Uh? Obviously? Then says that I better be glad every day that she missed that plane, and on and on... 

Then later we're talking about makeup. Pretty much nobody who knows me knows that, at 18, I was arrested and charged with petty theft. I was a bit of a klepto when I was a teenager, I'm not going to look too hard into the psychobabble of why. But I used to nick shit all the time. Target, mall, gas station food, whatever. I stole makeup from my mom all the time, but always gave it back. I used to get beat for it whenever it happened, but it was something I just couldn't stop. I obviously don't do it anymore but it really screwed up my life for a long time. So she's talking about her makeup and then she picks out some crusty, ten-year-old concealer thing that's missing half the parts, and says "oh look! That's one of the first things you ever stole from me. Remember how you used to do that? I can't believe how bad it got. You're terrible." 

My fianc knows what happened, I opened up to him about a year into the relationship. I only took so long because I was so fucking embarrassed. It's been five years. She just brought it up to shove it in my face after yapping about how excited and grateful I should be that she decided to randomly tell us this story about a plane that I don't fully believe. Yeah, makes me super happy. Love you too, mom. 

Happy fucking Mother's Day! I'm leaving early, having dinner with my fiancs mother who is still weird but better than mine, and then going home and getting trashed drunk and watching Game of Thrones. ~  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You have two options here, and neither of them having anything to do with making a decision about going or not going. 

1. You go, you keep a negative attitude and assume that this guy must be using or mistreating your sister, and your opinions won't be changed. You keep using the wrong "wrong" or "off" or bothered. Your sister sees this, she feels like you guys won't let her live her own life (which she clearly already feels) and things do not end well for your relationship with your sister. Realize that she may cut you out of her life indefinitely. 

2. You realize your sister is a grown ass woman who can make her own decisions. You let her know you love her and that you're glad she's happy. You keep up a good relationship with her, independent from your parents relationship with her. And you support her. As you should, because she is your sister and she's given you no reason to think anything is wrong with her. 

Go. Have dinner, maybe spend the night out there. See how normal it probably is. Is it about money? Probably at least a bit. But if this guy was just an insufferable asshole, she wouldn't be so happy. She has made a personal decision in her own life. Respect that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> He was my best friend. Then something more. Then something else. There was only ever one kiss - and I panicked and pulled away, and we laughed about it, but we still stripped down to our underwear and cuddled most nights for body heat in my freezing apartment, we still drank in my room and watched stupid shit on youtube, we still talked til dawn and opened up to each other about the darkest parts of us. Matt was the brightest part of my life for a very long time. As his personality disappeared, replaced by a frighteningly alpha-male personality splattered with contempt for anyone who didn't think he was funny, we fell apart. It happened over four years. Or maybe it happened faster than that, and I was just too blind to see it. 

We both started dating someone else. They broke up. I got engaged. He made up shit about how he thought my fiance was an asshole, so he didn't want to hang out with him/me anymore - my fiance is a shy, quiet engineer who respected my time with my friends enough to not need to be the center of attention. Maybe that's what Matt hated most. No matter how hard he tried, after I got together with Shane, Matt wasn't my number one anymore. Not after how he started treating me. Not after the things he said about me, about other women, about people he cared about. All for laughs on the internet. He was there the night I was sexually assaulted, the summer after high school. He broke down and told me he felt like it was his fault, like he failed to protect me. He cared so deeply about me and what I had been through. But his mind has been poisoned, one way or another. He dismissed an argument we had about it, just a few months ago, as "personal bullshit" and, even though we were in a debate with a bunch of other people specifically about sexual assault, told me what I was saying was irrelevant and that he wanted me to stop bringing it up because he didn't like it. Yeah, well, I don't like how your attitude has changed, and your friends sided with me, so fuck you. 

I wonder how often he thinks about me - I know he does, a mutual friend says they've talked about me quite a few times. I wonder how often he thinks about how we are now - distant, cold, bitter. And how often he thinks about those golden nights, up until dawn, talking about our dorky middle names or his alcoholic father or his mom's cooking or Korean horror movies or the people we went to high school with or our wildest dreams or anything, anything about what the future could have held for us. 

I miss him. I miss him like crazy. I want to message him and tell him to cut the crap. To hang out with me and quit the bullshit, to be my friend again. But I also want him to go to hell. I wish I'd never met him. I would give up every single one of our good moments to be able to still have the ability to trust a friend. He ruined that for me. 

What we had was chaotic at best. Years of on and off, romantic and friendly, caring and spiteful. I can't make friends anymore because I just expect them to break my heart. 

So, thanks, Matt. You are the worst thing that has ever happened to me. I know you've changed. You're not the man you used to be. And you broke me. Little by little, month by month, year by year, then all at once. And I couldn't stop missing you if I tried. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a fellow oil slick of a human I will totally vouch for Este Lauder Double Wear foundation. It's matte, but not too matte, and it is the ONLY foundation that doesn't have me looking like a greaseball by noon. And I've tried probably upwards of 65+ foundations. I use a hydrating primer and let it set in for a bit, and then the foundation last. 

I also agree with what other posters have said - moisturize, no matter what. Excess sebum can be a result of under-moisturized skin, because the skin tries to overcompensate. I started using a gentler cleanser, a good natural toner, and two heavy hydrators at night - a full on heavy duty night cream mixed with a beauty oil. I've noticed less oil and less breakouts since I started this. It seems counter-intuitive but sebum production is a weird, weird beast.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wore one from Little Black Diamond last year with no complaints. I wish I would have gotten one that was a little less conservative (I wore a style they don't have anymore: short sleeves, full back, scoop neck, good coverage on the bottoms.) it was comfortable but I was worried about being self conscious. The material was fairly breathable though and at one point I just poured water on myself to cool down lol. 

As for the bathroom issue.. I couldn't stomach the idea of being all nekkid in a porta potty either, but I used to swim competitively so I'm used to just pulling the crotch of a suit to the side to pee. As long as you're careful, which is easier when you're hovering anyway, you won't have a problem.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went through a similar sort of thing, but backwards. My fianc had been super good friends with this group of people since high school. When he and I first got together he was living with three of them, we all hung out at least once or twice a week, etc. Slowly, they started doing stuff without us. I always thought it was because they didn't like me, so I got kind of upset. I let it pass because I know he's an introvert and, like your situation, he seems to far prefer spending one-on-one time with me than with any group of multiple people. I figured maybe he was turning down invites for that reason, but then got a few messages over a few months asking why we'd been so busy and when could we hang out? We typically weren't THAT busy (though we both have divorced and remarried parents, so four sets of that did mean a lot of dinner plans).

Ends up this group of friends had been steadily devolving into a shitshow of petty, immature craplords who just made every outing about exclusivity and being assholes. The group had pretty much been split into two groups of people that hated each other and spent their nights talking shit about each other. They were all still friends, but the years had turned them into people who my fianc didn't want to hang out with anymore. He matured a bit faster than they did. He didn't want to hang out with them, so he told them we were busy with something else, a family thing, I had already made us plans, etc. His friends suddenly stopped asking and again I felt like it was my fault. Nope. He had just finally separated himself from them. And it was less about him using me as a scapegoat and more about the fact that he just didn't want to hang out with these people anymore, but he wasn't a confrontational person and didn't know how to break up with an entire group of friends like that. 

Don't go all ham and break up with him for this. Yeah, it's kind of shitty that he's using you as a scapegoat here, but he probably just didn't know another way. There's always the trope of the controlling girlfriend who steals her boyfriend away from his friends, and he may have felt like they'd just shrug it off and leave him alone if they finally came to that conclusion. Admit to snooping because you were curious about the cancelled plans. But confront him about why he's making you his scapegoat. Is it that he just doesn't want to hang out with these people anymore? If so, be okay with that and know that if you stop hanging out with these people, who gives a shit what they think about you? I highly doubt your boyfriend is telling his friends these things with the sole purpose of making them hate you. He's probably just trying to make a solid demarcation from that group of people. I was just as pissed as you are now during that initial stage of separation because I thought it was all my fault. It took a solid half dozen conversations for my fianc to come out with all the problems with this group and the reasons he was acting that way. I really do get the feeling that your boyfriend is doing something similar. He doesn't want them to think he's a dick, but he doesn't want to actually see them, either. 

My fianc and I don't see that old group of friends anymore. I don't care if they think I stole him away. In the long run we're going to have an awesome relationship and we won't have to waste time with people we don't like. We can spend that time making new friends who like both of us and who we like spending time with.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Duckling season at Disneyland is my favorite thing. Fun fact, last year around this same season I took my camera to Disneyland and took a bunch of pictures of them because, duh, look. at. them. And then the next week near my house this mother duck crossed the street but her ducklings couldn't make it over the barrier and were frantically running around this fairly busy street, so myself and another Good Samaritan got out and chased eight ducklings down and helped them over the lil grassy median and they found their mom at the other side, and that's MY duckling story!

<TEXT> This sounds like something beyond your control. It can be difficult dealing with parents who have skewed ideas of parenting. 

Honestly? It sounds like a much bigger problem than her not playing with the neighborhood kids. Her parents making her put that much effort into her appearance and then chastising her for being proud of other accomplishments is bizarre, especially at her age. If it were me, I would call the school, explain who you are, and give them a brief rundown on what's happening and suggest they have a school counselor check up on her. Ask that they keep your name out of it. A counselor is much better equipped to handle something like this, and the parents obviously aren't going to initiate that, so you might need to before they cause some real psychological damage to this kid.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Depression/Embarrassing event made me lose all of my self-confidence. Cue the intimacy problems and crappy attitude. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey, so, a little background. My fianc (28M) and I (25F) have been together almost four and a half years, living together for all of that. In that four years I've put on like 25 pounds. I'm not happy about it, but I've always been fairly comfortable with my body, especially in my relationship. I know he's attracted to me, so I must be attractive in his eyes. I clean up nice, but I am definitely a bit overweight. Think size 12ish. 

I'm a nanny full time, and one of the kids friends called me fat. Behind my back, when he thought I wasn't listening. I felt particularly grubby that day anyway (hot/windy day), plus the middle girl who is 7 agreed with the kid, and it just hit me in the gut.  I went home and cried and my fianc did his best to comfort me. 

Since then I've been a difficult person to deal with. I've lost all sense of self-confidence and I hate my body. I feel like this one stupid 9 year old kid finally said what I had been thinking for a while. I had gotten too big. I had put on too much weight. 

For the few weeks since then, fianc and I have been going to the gym, eating healthy, etc. Except I've been a total jerk. I'm crabby, I'm moody, I don't feel like I can wear anything without looking like a whale. I don't even want him to put his arm around me because I know he feels my fat. A few days ago we went to bed and he started making moves and I started crying again because I felt like he was doing it out of pity. Like he just wanted to make me feel better. I honestly do know that isn't the case but in the moment, when I'm feeling vulnerable, it feels that way. It's crushing. 

How do I get my mojo back with my guy? How can I let him know what all is going on and how this actually really upset me? I don't want to be like "hey we can't sleep together for a while because I'm moody." But that's pretty much how I'm feeling. I can't enjoy it. I feel like I've lost 100% of the confidence he's helped instill in me over the last four years. I want it back.  </TEXT>

I got the correct email off a fellow redditor a few months ago. I started emailing in mid April. Have sent one a week since then, no reply. I usually carry a collapsible cane and I have pain meds I carry in case of emergency. I have a degenerative spinal condition that is super unpredictable and can really mess me up if I don't have a solid place to sit and relax my back/hips/shoulders. This is kind of a make or break thing here. I know there's plenty of time left but I really don't feel like placating myself by reminding myself that we have almost two months is a good idea, especially if something were to be not allowed when I finally get a response and I would need to find an alternate solution at the last minute. 

Has anyone here dealt with their accessible team in the past? What's it like? Did you run into any problems?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It took a long time for me to work up the courage to do this. When I was 9 I started exhibiting signs of an Anxiety Disorder, so my mom stuck me with a child psychiatrist who asked me to "draw how I was feeling" and then shared every single thing with my mom, who would pester me about everything that I said that she thought might make her look bad. I stopped psych shortly after because I just couldn't stand it. It didn't help anything. I yelled at my mom, told her this wasn't going to help if I couldn't talk about things that were actually bothering me. They medicated me on and off, but I stopped taking it when it started making me into a robot. (Paxil! Screwing with kids since forever.) 

I'm 25 now. Two and a half years ago I was diagnosed with a degenerative spinal condition and thus have serious chronic pain issues to contend with. I have also, through one-off counseling sessions and a few professional assessments, been diagnosed with Depression. I have self-harmed in the past but have been clean for a few months now. 

The year or two after my diagnosis, I couldn't afford to go back to a psychiatrist. Now that I'm technically disabled, I qualify for government insurance. They cover outpatient mental health care and medication. 

I am taking a first real step. I've been thinking about doing this for six years and I'm finally doing it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's like you stole one of the major problems of my teen years! 

When I was in elementary/6/7th grade, my grandma would take my sisters out for clothes every school year and some Christmases. My grandma then retired and couldn't always afford to do so, so I got chastised for not making an effort. My mom was morbidly obese at the time and I feel like it was a "don't make the same mistakes I made" kind of thing. 

The makeup thing was always so bizarre. She encouraged me to start wearing makeup in 8th grade "if you want to", which was nice. Then she started wearing some too. She would buy herself hundreds of dollars of makeup then forbid me from having any, but comment on how "patchy and cheap" mine looked. It never did. She just needed one more thing to control. Ugh.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Posting this tip this year since I haven't seen it yet and it's a LIFESAVER! It seriously saved my weekend last year and everyone who has ever gotten that thigh chafing rash should check this out. 

There's a product called Body Glide - made for runners who chafe, but just as amazing for those of us who are bottom heavy/chafe easily. Seriously. Your inner thighs will thank you. I bought a tube on Amazon a few years ago, it lasts forever. I sometimes reapply midway through the night but it's a small sacrifice to pay for infinitely more comfort. It looks like your standard deodorant tube - twist up, plastic case. But whatever chubby baby angel tears they put in there are awesome. I think it cost me like seven bucks, and security never hassled me about it. Some people have said security asks, but all you have to say is that it prevents painful chafing and they won't stop you. 

Especially with all the sweating/walking around, this stuff is awesome. Less mess and better staying power than baby powder.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Do they think I'm making this stuff up? I brought over all my records, all my results and labs and charts. I have pages of doctors notes and my notes and notebooks full of symptoms and meds and everything. Things that worked, things that didn't work. 

Before I lost my old insurance in June-ish of last year, I had a decent HMO, a fairly attentive team of doctors. I was easily prescribed Percocet for pain, my pain management clinic helped me try a ton of different options. 

Now I'm stuck on medi cal because I can't work. It's nice to not have to pay for most things, but reaaaally not cool that they're making me start my pain plan over. They told me today that they want to start my pain meds on Ibuprofen 800s. Ibuprofen. Ibuprofen. I told them it wouldn't work and the doctor looked at me like I was just looking to score opioids. Ugh. Next Doctor, please. 

The hospital wasn't bad. I can luckily visit the hospital I was seeing before, and if I go through the ER I don't get charged. They gave me some decent meds, let me lay around for a while, and sent me on my way. That ER is like 85% perfect and I had an awesome nurse today. 

But I'm so dreading this MONTHS LONG process of redeveloping a treatment plan because some jerk thinks he's king of the world and sooooo obviously knows my body and my condition better than my entire previous team - despite admitting he'd never even heard of my condition before. 

And my back hurts like hell. They gave me Valium for muscle pain which actually worked fairly well, but not enough to really release these muscle spasm things I've got going on.

Just... Ugh. This whole system is so screwed up.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Former scapegoat frustrated with nMom's treatment of former GC/current scapegoat sister. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Mekdiaodjwoskdjqkdnwkca okay don't criticize my crap format, on mobile and can't type as fast as I can think here 

I (25F) had a rough relationship with my nMom. Verbally, emotionally, and occasionally physically abusive. nMom is bipolar and has decided some time in the last decade and a half that the doesn't need to be medicated for whatever reason. Okay. Her choice. But. No. 

I was kicked out or willingly moved out 30+ times, starting at age 13. No matter what I did, it was wrong. She would trick me into thinking she was better, that she was getting help, that we could have a relationship again. Then I'd come home to shrieking and stuff thrown at my head and orders to clear out of the house before she burned all my stuff or fought me or whatever. K. There were so many times she threatened to never speak to me again or to cut off my phone or throw away/burn/donate all my belongings, but no matter how many times she relented and gave me a few hours to clean/pack up, I still felt fear every time. Fights always escalated to verbal abuse within 60 seconds. I moved out for the last time ~4.5 years ago to live with my now-fiance, even though we'd only been dating a few weeks, because I clued him in to my mom's bizarro behavior. She is sick. I know. And for someone with no N experience, he almost didn't believe me. That changed quickly, thank god. I was VLC for almost two years. Things were good. The less I saw of my mom, the more tolerable she was when I had to see her. 

My sister is 3 years younger than I am. She was always the GC - mommy's girl, her shopping buddy, her best friend. My mom never pulled that shit with her when we were younger. To be fair, I always had a bit of an attitude. My sister was a brown noser. Still is. But my sister is also one of the hardest working, genuine, loving people I know. Which is why I am having a hard time with my nMom turning the tables and ruining her relationship with her other kid. She knows that didn't go well the first time. She knows what it did to our family. Shit I can't talk about. 

To the point - my sister hadn't answered my calls in two or three days. Not highly unusual but she was due to come to my house one night and didn't, which IS actually unusual. I shoot my mom a text asking if something is going on with my sister, and she says it's too much to text, can I take a call? Yeah, sure, I can. Do I want to give my mother the opportunity to drone on for an hour? No. But she's at work. She can't get away with more than 10 minutes. So I let her call me, and she proceeds to - I shit you not - give me a total valley girl voice, like she's twirling her hair on the other end and rolling her eyes about the *injustice of it all*. And she goes on for her full ten minutes about how my sister didn't clean her room (she has previously told my sister she doesn't care if the room is clean. She charges my sister $600 a month for the room, she's paying rent; she can make a mess.) so she called my sister and threatened to throw "all her stupid shit away". Uh. And she says it with this stupid voice like I'm supposed to back her up and like I should be proud of her or something? I don't say a word. 

So then she says she called my sister that afternoon and my sister didn't pick up. My sister was at work. She works retail and can't bring her phone on the floor. She gives my mom her schedule every week because my mom demands it so that she knows where my sister is at all times. My 22-year-old, grown, responsible sister. But my mom then gleefully tells me that she told my sister's voicemail that if she didn't call her back by some arbitrary time - less than an hour from when she left the message - that she was going to cut off her phone service and lock her out of the house for the night. Same smug, self-satisfied, "aren't I good?" Tone. I cannot physically punch people through an iPhone. But if I could, I would have. 

I hate that all of this got dumped on my sister when I left. This shit happens and my mom doesn't realize she's killing her relationship with both of us - not that she's got much of one left with me. I can't. I just can't. 

Just that tone though. And she's started saying stupid shit lately like "you know how your sister is" and "well you would know, you were the same/worse than your sister at that age." Or shit like "now that you're grown up, you understand." And "I just want the best for you!" Uh. No. Me aging five years did not trigger any kind of magic rainbow "it's okay that my mom abused me for years!" Feeling. 

My dad was an enabler. He remarried and married an N. My mom hasn't technically married her boyfriend but he's an enabler just like my dad was. It's horrific. 

I am fiercely protective of my sister. I have backed her up too many times to count. But this is the final straw. Nowhere in that conversation does my mom mention money. She normally bitches if my sister is like two hours late with rent. They had a system - my sister directly transferred her rent for the month into my moms account. There was a record. Apparently the last two months, my mom has been making my sister give her cash. My sister has always pulled cash every week for various expenses, so her withdrawals for the last two months are way more than her rent. No clear record. When I texted my sister asking her about mom's weird behavior, she informed me that both of those months, my mom has insisted that my sister didn't pay her the full months rent last month. So twice, she has made my sister pay her 750 instead of 600. She has told my sister that if she doesn't pay the "new, fixed amount" she will no longer allow her into the house and her belongings will go in a dumpster, her car/phone will be taken away, her access to her debit card (shared) and her credit card (not shared, but secured with a loan from mom), etc. My mom is stealing money from my sister. And threatening to evict her. 

The last year had been almost okay between us. Again. Tolerable. But this just destroyed any progress she thought she had made. 

And to top it off, her brother - my uncle - is getting married in two days. We have a very small family. This will not be easy. Help.  </TEXT>

Last year we split with two other couples. This year we don't know anyone else going! I think it'll still be awesome (and less stress with meeting up/losing people we're supposed to drive home or whatever) but we're a little iffy about the whole long weekend alone. 

Is there any sort of meet up for couples? Or should I just hope cool people find me on here? Lol. We probably want to do a pool party or two, walk around the strip a bit, etc. maybe meet up with a couple at the event at some sets who listens to similar stuff. 

We're so out of the loop right now with EDM but our long time favorites are Dash Berlin, Tritonal, Seven Lions, Alesso, Zedd, Hardwell, Knife Party... We're sort of all over the place. Not super big bass heads but still exploring. 

Let me know if you're a couple going solo (duo?) or if you are just some cool, similarly-aged people who would be cool meeting up with some laid back, weird, nerdy 20-somethings! Or if you know how to meet up with said people.  </TEXT>

Three years ago I went on a bar crawl with my closest friends that was nothing short of a mess. 

Two years ago I had a big family dinner and saw friends all week. 

One year ago I invited a bunch of "friends" to dinner and spent the whole night picking at my plate while everyone talked about shit they'd done without me and hadn't even invited me to. 

This year my own fianc almost forgot to say it this morning. None of my family has reached out to me. I have zero plans and nobody has had the intention of even meeting up for a drink.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For whatever reason I never liked Caleb before 6B. Not like an intense dislike, I just didn't care for him at all. Not my type kinda deal. I wasn't a huge fan of he and Hannah's relationship because it just seemed so high school. Like yes, they dealt with a ton of other things that irl high school kids do not. But they constantly fought and they never seemed to really appreciate each other. I just thought they didn't mesh well. I love Hannah but I just didn't like Caleb at all. 

Then 6B. I dig the haircut, first off. Caleb's. But the Spencer thing? They had some obvious, albeit light-handed, chemistry in earlier seasons. I noticed it and was a fan only because I don't like Toby all that much either. Sue me. Never a Spoby or Haleb fan. Not exactly a huge fan of Ezria either because that guy gives me the creeps. Always intrigued by Spaleb. Spaaaaleeeebb. 

6B is actually the first time I've reaaaally given a shit about the ships. I watch the show because it IS a nine ring circus... But man. Spaleb. Someone else posted about all their arm touches. As friends. And the hugs. They always seemed a little physical. A little too similar. Tbh Spaleb is endgame. 

I can see Hannah breaking off her engagement because she still isn't 100% over Caleb, but less like trying to get back with Caleb and more realizing that she still has some moving on and growing up to do before she can settle down. 

I go saying this and IMK is going to go put all the boring high school relationships back together in six episodes or less. Watch. Ugh.

<TEXT> My first thought was "what the ever-living f*ck" but after I watched a few videos, I'm intrigued. I'm not a huge matte lip fan but I've been wearing KVD Everlasting Liquid because it stays on so well (and I just got engaged, we smooch a lot!) so I'm wondering if this could be a cool alternative for when I want something... Else. Lots of people said they've put balms or glosses over them and they stay forever. 

Anyone here tried them? I'm ordering some on Friday (Berrisom) and I guess I'll just see how it goes, lol  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mom doesn't even really know what Reddit is, but still. I frequent this place. After learning, a few years ago, that my mothers bizarre behavior had a name, I post and read and respond here fairly often. 

So. 

Today I'm organizing a lunch with nMom, my future (possibly N) MIL, and my grandma. We're organizing my engagement party and getting Thai food. She mentions over texts that she's starving because she missed breakfast, except she then says she did have food this morning. Says something about thinking about curry. But what kind of curry? And I go to type in "Mmmm curry." Except it autocorrects to "nMom curry". I send it. Cool. I'm immediately thinking she's going to google nMom and blow up. 

To most people this would be an "oh shit" moment. Except. My moms last name is Curry. Literally. And I have very limited sense of humor. So when she replies back with "huh?" I just said "lol, Mom Curry." She lols, I lol, the toaster lols, I stare in terror at my screen, everything is great. 

Funny thing is, our "Curry" is only spelled that way because my grandpa's last name was spelled wrong on his birth certificate. Should have been Currie. So thanks, hick town nurse from 70-something years ago, for misspelling something that my grandpas parents didn't care to fix, because now I got to use it as an autocorrect fumble excuse that potentially saved me from death by my mother's screeching.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, a brief review of what life was like for me a year ago. A few years ago I was diagnosed with a rare, incurable, painful spinal condition. I was in the hospital once a month, in pain every other day. The way my condition works made it possible that I wouldn't be able to carry a child to term for fear of paralyzing myself. My family wasn't terribly supportive and my boyfriend was drawing away. I think he was feeling like he couldn't take care of me. I hated my job. I wasn't accomplishing anything I wanted to do, I felt like I was at a dead end. My depression and anxiety were at an all-time high. Holidays with my family sucked, everyone was mad at each other, I'd lost a lot of friends due to my inability to function normally. We were frustrated with living with other people. And to top it off, just after all of this, I very suddenly lost my medical insurance and wasn't able to care for myself in any way. All of this came to a peak on Christmas Eve last year. I was miserable. I usually looked forward to the holidays, but that day all I wanted to do was sleep. 

This year, things couldn't get much better. My symptoms are becoming more manageable, my depression is barely there anymore. I love my job! I'm a nanny to three AMAZING, intelligent, clever kids that I adore, the family appreciates me and the parents are great (and gave me a SIZABLE holiday bonus for a nanny!). My family still isn't all there but we're on the mend. I applied for state insurance and qualified for Medi-Cal, which means I can actually afford to take care of my mind and body again. So even if depression pops back up, I'll be prepared to handle it like I wasn't last year. Holidays were crazy but great. 

Probably best of all is this: on our four-year dating anniversary, in front of the Disneyland castle, my crazy-shy boyfriend proposed to me in front of like dozens of people! The ring is a beautiful setting I've always loved, and the diamond belonged to my late grandmother. We're getting married! In the forest! And because my symptoms are under control too, having babies down the road is totally possible. So my fiance - my best friend, my rock, my person - and I are getting our own place again, and everything is looking up. 

Just kind of on a cloud right now and thought I'd share!

<TITLE> NMom and future nMIL had their first real meeting today. Nothing. Bad. Happened. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My mother is severely and supremely delusional and narcissistic. After her divorce from my father four years ago (an N himself) she immediately dove into a new relationship and used it to "re-invent" herself. AKA revert to the stupid, drunken high school party girl she was when she met my dad. AKA used it as an excuse to pretend everything between us is a-okay because she's "better now" and a "whole new person". She was fairly emotionally and physically abusive during my upbringing. She likes to pretend it never happened. I was NC for a while but I don't live with her anymore and I got sick, so, contact was resumed. I just don't put up with her shit anymore. 

I started dating my amazing fianc about 4 years ago and have been living with him since like two weeks after that. He doesn't yet know I was practically homeless at the time (mom decided day by day whether or not I was allowed to live with her, I usually wasn't for whatever shitty reason, I slept in a lot of weird places) but that's another story. 

I met his mom. Nice enough at first. But time showed me her true colors. She's the same as my mom. Almost identical. Except she never had the violent tendencies, just the blaming and whining and whatever. Confirmed by my future Sis in law. She's just a falsely friendly person. She gets nasty and shuts people out pretty quick. She hasn't really done it to me because I think she knows if she tried, my fianc wouldn't let it slide. She wants to keep on his good side, he's the GC and he fixes her stuff all the time. 

We got engaged a little while ago. My mom, his mom, my grandmother (who knows all about my mom and helped me as much as as she could) and myself had our first lunch today to discuss engagement party stuff. I as ready for weird remarks, for sarcastic laughter, for attention stealing and eye rolls. I mostly stayed quiet except to put in my two cents about the party. They talked. And talked. And... 

Nothing bad happened. Not a single thing. They both played nice. Even when they had slightly conflicting opinions. There was hardly any one-upping or anything like that. I walked out strangely relieved. 

I'm not letting my guard down or anything. I know crazy can strike at any minute. But wow. Wow. Wooooww. That went a thousand times better than I could have ever expected. When I told my fianc it went well, his response was "Good. Wait. Really?" 

Yes. Really. Miracles do happen, I guess.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Any advice for Wedding planning with Ns involved? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-16 23:13:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Boyfriend is proposing to me this weekend, I'm 99% sure. If not, next week. Yay! A supportive, loving person in my life who sees how my parents are and doesn't force me to talk to them/give me the guilt about "they're family!". Seriously this guy is amazing. He's my best friend. I'm so freaking excited I can't sleep. 

Problem - my parents are both narcissists. His mom is, too. Our parents are all divorced and remarried, so we have eight parents. Three of them are Ns - my bio parents and his bio mom. All steps are great and his bio dad is great. 

My mom spent the entire day of my devastating medical diagnosis talking about how she had to move offices, and wasn't that terrible for her? And why couldn't I just let her talk about her problems "for once". My quotes. Her emphasis. She's a massive drama queen and can't let anything go. Everything is about her. She will have moments of clarity ("I can't let my experiences with your father cloud how happy you are in your relationship") but it doesn't last long. 

My dad is a habitual, compulsive liar. He's just a jerk, basically. And he acts like he's the king and we all have to come beg at his feet for anything. He once lent me money (a few hundred dollars) and insisted that I didn't pay him back. ("You're my kid! Of course I'll help you out. I don't want you to pay me back. Let me help.") he then pestered/verbally abused me in order to get money out of me when he got fired from his job. I wouldn't pay him (couldn't afford to if I tried). My boyfriend went behind my back and paid my dad off and told him to quit harassing me. (Totally annoyed that he went behind my back and gave into my dads shit, but I can't be mad at the guy for standing his ground against my dad, who is a pretty big guy.) his wife is an enabler, to the max, but she also has her moments of clarity. She basically thinks my dad is exactly the king he pretends to be and that he can do no wrong. 

My future MIL is a bit of an N. She guilts her kids into doing weird shit for her all the time - getting my SO to help her with tech stuff for a church she volunteers her accounting services to (she doesn't even go to church) and just generally guilting his sister. My SO was very much the GC and his sister the SG, though their mom wasn't nearly as bad as my mom from what I know. 

I've talked wedding stuff with my moms and my SO's mom a few times. Mostly, I get the feeling that I'm going to have to be firm, draw a few thousand lines, etc. I have been dreaming about my wedding since I was a kid, my SO likes all the things I like, etc. We're not doing traditional who-pays-what kind of things. Any set of parents can contribute whatever they want. Totally privately. We've had each set of parents express interest in helping, financially. We'll put in the rest. But for the most part, the decisions are ours. If someone insists on something minor, fine. I don't care as much about the wedding as I do about the life that comes after it, so whatever. 

I don't know if I want my father to walk me down the aisle. He hasn't been a sturdy presence in my life in years. I was thinking of having my sister walk me. It might hurt NDad's feelings but, you know what, if he wanted that place of honor in my wedding, he probably shouldn't have abandoned my sister and I after our parents divorce and moved hours away, refusing to drive out to see us and making us drive two hours each way to see him. 

Just feeling ridiculously excited but also... Dread. Lots of dread. Each parent on their own is enough. I'm not looking forward to having all eight of our parents in a room at the same time. More than once. I've already told both of my sets of parents that if they step out of line and do anything crazy/fight with each other/fight with me or my SO, they will not be attending my wedding. My SOs parents aren't such a big deal, they've been divorced like 20+ years. My parents have been divorced like 4 years and still hate each other. 

Help. Any experience/advice?

<TEXT> I have been feeling really... Not great, for a while. Not suicidal or anything, but not like I wanted to be alive, either. I'm overwhelmed. To put it lightly. 

I've known this person since we were four or five years old. We've always been friends. Even when he moved across the country two years ago to be with his girlfriend, we still caught up and saw each other when we could. That girlfriend broke up with him, so he called me tonight to vent and just bounce ideas. 

But he just reminded me that I'm not alone, that we're very similar people and that we care about each other and are great friends. 

In a moment where I felt very alone, he unknowingly reminded me that I am not alone at all. 

Pick up the phone. See your "person" or any person you know you can just vent to, or even just talk about meaningless stuff with. Relate to someone for a bit. I hope it gives you as much relief as it's giving me right now.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> How do I tell my roommate that his sick girlfriend shouldn't be at our house? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-17 22:12:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A little background - I (24F) live with my fiance (27M) in a four bedroom townhouse with our roommate (also 27M), who is my fiance's longtime friend. His girlfriend was living halfway across the country for the first year. It was understood that once she came back, she'd be over now and then. Not a problem. But she's loud, annoying (not a lot of our friends like her) and inconsiderate. That's almost besides the point, though. That's gotten better, after we talked once or ten times. 

But last week, he got back from an international trip. Understandably, she wanted to spend some time with him. Only when they showed up, she sounded like she was hacking up a lung. Seriously. She's very clearly very ill, I'm guessing with a nasty cold or the flu. She's been here (minus two days this weekend when he was out of town again) for nearly a week, now. So not only is she nearing the deadline for being here, (our lease and roommate agreement both state that we can't have guests longer than a week without getting permission from the landlord) she's been at the house (even during the day when he's at work, which is not cool) while she's spreading germs, using our kitchen and cooking tools/dishes, etc. 

If I worked any normal job where I could take sick days or just go to work sick, it wouldn't be so big of a deal. But I'm a nanny for a family of three kids. Going to work sick means that I get the kids sick. In order to keep three kids from getting sick, I would need to stay home from work - which requires that one of their parents stays home from work to watch the kids. So being sick not only causes me to miss work/lose money, it affects the family that I work for. 

I can't take it any more. A day or two, when he first came back? Maybe understandable. But when she's been here for a week, hardly leaving, and sick? That's not okay. She lives with her parents, she can stay there when she's sick like she usually does. It's not okay to risk getting us sick, and by association the kids and family I work with. 

How do I bring this up? It may seem petty or less of an issue than her being noisy, but sickness is a zero-tolerance thing for me. I can't afford to miss work or get the family sick. I hate having to talk to him about her over and over again, but just when it's been long enough that we haven't talked about it in a while, she comes back and pulls shit again. 

Problem - she knows a lot of us don't like her. I know she's beginning to think it's a personal thing. I'm sure she's nice enough when I don't have to listen to her screaming at 10:30 at night, but that's the only time I see her, so it's getting shitty. I don't want these continued talks to keep making her mad and keep making her act up just to piss us off (she and her boyfriend/our roommate are kind of assholes, but they're better than a lot of roomates). 

Help.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, a little backstory - my parents were married 24 years and, except for the last year or two, seemed absolutely blissful. They were the least likely candidates for divorce among my group of friends and our family friends, so their eventual deterioration and divorce was shocking, messy, and awful for my sister and I. They had definitely fought over the years, and I will readily admit I was a very difficult child, but he and my mother were verbally abusive for some time, something I didn't realize until their divorce was happening and the image of our perfect family was shattered - the good times no longer outshone the nights of screaming, shouting, my parents pitting my sister and I against each other and themselves.

I was always closer with my dad, he typically protected me from some of my mom's more explosive bouts of anger (read: uncontrolled bipolar disorder along with other issues, I suspect) so seeing the way he treated my mom (and later, my sister) during this divorce was a little like seeing your idol taking a shit in public - super disappointing and really gross. He started mildly abusing pain medication he'd gotten a while before for a wrist surgery, became explosively angry at the littlest things, and one time followed my sister in the car while she took a walk outside the apartment because he was convinced she was going "somewhere she wasn't supposed to". (This is still a bizarre, unexplained incident. He and my sister fought about it once but I didn't want to ask.

My dad remarried less than two years after his split with my mom, and his new family is eerily like our old one - two daughters, about the same age apart, my stepmom has similar mental health issues to my mother, they do all the same things, etc. My stepmom and I have talked, on occasion, about how my dad used to be, and she doesn't seem to believe me. I don't blame her, the honeymoon phase can be blinding. But it's a little bothersome. They live about an hour and a half away, two hours with traffic (and we live in LA, there's always traffic). But he NEVER drives out to visit us, it's always up to us to go visit him.

My mom was far from perfect too, they were toxic to each other in their last year or two. I moved out just a few weeks after they decided on divorce, moved in with my boyfriend (who I'd then only been dating a few weeks, but we carpooled to our jobs and he lived with roommates/on his own so he was totally okay with me staying there while my family blew up, he encouraged it). That was four years ago. We've been talking about getting married for a long time, but it's finally all coming to fruition. He's supportive, affectionate, the total strong but silent type.

The last four years have been terminally awkward. My dad makes up lies about my sister and I. He's basically turned all of our extended family against us - even though they all know he's a massive liar. He tells them we never try to contact him and that we've blocked him on social media, when really it was the other way around - I offered the olive branch, I always texted, called, etc. My stepmom would always be watching his phone, convinced he was talking to my mom. She wouldn't tell him we called, etc. He just stopped making an effort. I hadn't fought with him since the divorce, but a year ago he deleted and blocked me on Facebook out of nowhere, and he still claims to this day that he didn't do it and he doesn't know what happened, but when I tell him he's the only one who can re-add me, he never does. That was over a year ago.

I'm so torn. My dad and I were always so close, when we do see each other it's like nothing bad ever happened, but... below the surface, it bothers me. Every time I see him I'm reminded of his little lies, his desperate attempt to paint himself as the victim in that divorce and what happened after. He's busy with his new family. I get it. But I always pictured my dad walking me down the aisle.

I went out to his house yesterday with my soon-to-be-fiance (We've had an appointment, I tried on rings, I'm just waiting for him to surprise me). It was fine, but he didn't even make an effort to really talk to me. Bare minimum. I hadn't even thought about it until today, but after yesterday's frustrating visit, it suddenly hit me tonight while eating dinner. I don't know if I want my dad to walk me down the aisle. I don't feel like daddy's little girl anymore. I have had to go from dependent on and very close with my parents to being fairly independent/living with my fiance. I wouldn't consider having my mom walk me, either.

I honestly don't know what to do. I've been the only one making an effort, and if I tell him I don't want him to walk me down the aisle, it might be the final straw with him. The problem is, I love my stepsisters and I want them to be my bridesmaids. So I don't want my own father to be part of my wedding, but I want his new daughters to be in it. It's just tough. I honestly think he might cease contact with me if I exclude him. I know it's my day, but is there a way I can present it/change tradition in a way that doesn't seem anti-him, it just seems pro-something else?

I shouldn't be afraid of losing contact with him, because he's sort of obviously an asshole, but he's my dad and he's stubborn. I have a feeling that once he's gone, he'd be gone for good. He's fought with my sister for so long that he's never met his first grandchild, a boy, and the kid's two and a half now.

I considered having my sister walk me down the aisle. That's probably what I'm going to end up doing. Have any of you guys done this before? What was your alternative? I've considered walking alone, too, because I'm a grown ass woman and all that.

I think I just need advice on HOW to tell him, and maybe like ten internet hugs. Sorry if this was so long! I just don't have a ton of places to go for this kind of help. Thanks in advance for any advice.

<TITLE> My spinal condition is literally making me stupider. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-08 11:21:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been having weird neurological symptoms on and off for 5 or so years. Two years I was diagnosed with a rare and untreatable spinal condition, as well as a herniation of the brain stem known as Chiari Malformation. My Chiari is minor but the other issue is bigger. 

Sufferers of both of these conditions have brain fog. Like, almost every person. To the point where some people can't work just because they can't focus long enough to drive. 

I was always a smart kid - top of my class sort of smart. Amazing test scores. I didn't stick with college though, my interest in education waned, and I now see that it matches up with my diagnosis. 

I've been writing for fun since I was a kid. A few years back I decided to get involved in a book writing challenge. But I've felt less and less able to perform. 

My vocabulary is not what it once was. I lose words or jumble up sentences fairly frequently. I have a lot of trouble verbalizing or writing or anything like that. I used to write beautifully, everyone told me so. Nobody tells me that anymore. 

Writing was my THING. My identity. I've lost it. And I just feel so dumb. When my fianc and I got together four years ago, I was still making witty banter and having deep theoretical conversations and whatnot. Now I can't keep focus long enough to watch a 20 minute TV show. Hell, I can't stay focused for four minutes. I've tried. 

I hate this. I hate feeling stupid. But there's nothing I can do about it.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Recently found out my dog died after a few years of not seeing her. Am having a minor crisis. </TITLE>

<TEXT> We got my old dog - Sunshine - when I was 8. She was a blonde lab, German Shepard, ridgeback mix. Doofiest dog in the world - sliding down our wood-floored hallways, walking straight into glass doors, rolling around in dirt, the whole deal. The very first day we had her, we had just come from adopting her, we went to a friend's backyard BBQ and this dog, my beautiful stupid smiley dog, bolts through the back door and takes a flying leap right into the swimming pool. She'd been the smallest dog of three in a single crate when we found her, timid at best, but she'd warmed up to my family within minutes. That was 16 years ago, and she wasn't more than 6 months when we got her. 

5 or so years ago, my parents - who had always been the perfect couple, always so happy - went through a horribly messy divorce. We had to sell our old house, and we couldn't find a rental near us that would allow big dogs. We couldn't just give our dog away, so we spent weeks desperately asking family members and friends to hold on to her for a few weeks. Finally, a really close family friend - also fresh off a divorce - let us know that he was moving out to the desert, to a little house on a huge lot with lots of space for a dog to run around. And that he could use a friend out there. I will never be able to thank him enough for that. She was getting older already when they moved. 12, I think. Limping a bit. But he sent pictures every once in a while or told stories about her jumping into the car and wanting to go everywhere with him - something she could do in his tiny town that we hadn't been able to do for her in my city. 

I hadn't heard anything from him - or indirectly through my mom - for a year or two. I was secretly sort of glad. I knew she was getting on in years, and as long as I didn't hear it, I could pretend she was still laying in the shade, chasing a truck, or sticking her head out the window. 

A few weeks ago I went camping with my mom and some of our family. She chose a nice day at the beach to tell me that our Sunshine had died a little while back. I wanted to scream. I hated her a little bit in that moment, just because she had to be the one to tell me. I had known it was coming but I wasn't ready. I held it in. I almost felt like it wouldn't be too big of a deal. 

It hit me all at once tonight. Every single thing. How she'd lay on the warm wood floors just inside our glass back door. How she scattered food like crazy when she ate. She was a trouble maker, for damn sure, but she was our baby. How she'd bound up to the front door when she heard the car pull up, reaching her front paws up against this little metal bar on the door so that she could see us get out of the car through the glass panes in the door. Her dirty, ragged Sun and Moon collar. The smell of the dog shampoo we used to wash her with in the backyard, my sister and I struggling to clean this crazy, playful dog in the summer heat. 

I got up and sifted through the single box of pictures I have from my childhood, praying to whatever higher power that there was a picture of her. There was only one. 

We're camping. The picture is of me and my dad, standing behind this huge driftwood log while Sunshine stands on top of the log. She had this habit of looking right at the camera when she saw us doing it. She looks almost posed, her tail wagging. It broke my heart a little to see it, but if I didn't have a single picture of her I'd be devastated. 

I've been like totally sobbing for the last hour and a half and I'm just writing this because... I don't know. I know it's going to be too hard to talk about her in person for a while, to my fianc or anything. I feel like this is as close as she'll get to a eulogy. A doggie funeral. 

My last years spent with her, I was a lousy, grumpy teenager. I wanted her OUT of my room, quiet, out of my way. Funny how you always regret not spending time with people, once it's too late. I haven't had a pet since, and I keep itching to get a smaller dog or a cat, but I don't know if I can go through this again. 

I miss my dog, you guys, and I'm so fucking sad right now.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My family fell apart and nobody makes an effort anymore. My relationship is stagnant and stale and pretty much one sided now. My job is alright, but I'd still rather be doing anything else. I have struggled to lose weight for years. I hate the way I look, I'm not cool or funny or fun to be around anymore since I got a pretty serious diagnosis a few years ago. I've lost all my friends. I just don't do anything and I don't care anymore. 

I used to enjoy life. I did stupid stuff and partied a lot and met tons of people, but I enjoyed my life at that time. 

Lately I feel like there might be so much more for me out there, but where? I don't have the means to drop everything and go looking for this ideal life, as simple as it is in my head. 

So I'm stuck in one place, not a happy place, with no means to escape and no desire to do anything about it. 

I just don't care. And I'm tired of dragging everyone else around me down too. I don't enjoy anything anymore. Reading and writing used to be my respite and now I can't stand to do either of them. 

I don't know if I'm just venting or what. Just really unhappy with basically my entire life right now.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm Kate (Justkate), third year ML for Long Beach and Torrance :: California :: USA. What a doozy. 

For our area, we're a fairly spread out region. Not nearly as big as some regions obviously, comparatively tiny to regions that are entire countries, but a solid hour drive from west to east or north to south. We used to just be Long Beach, but when I applied it was actually to form a new region in the Torrance area, and they asked me to take over Long Beach as well. It's twice the area and literally 700% more people. Making it work. 

Last year though I had my sister as my lead minion - super helpful. This year she applied and now I have her as a Co-ML! I'm not sure I've ever heard of a sibling ML team before. I got her into it a couple years ago (this will be her third real NaNo, my ninth) and I have been pestering her to stick around since. Aww. 

Any questions about what we do? I know every region is different, but for the most part we handle the same things. I can also give you an idea as to how weird regions work things out, either really big or really small, and what kinds of crazy things we've heard or seen as MLs that you wouldn't expect. Coordinating novel writers is thrilling stuff, you know.

<TEXT> There's only so much an actor can do with a weird piece of writing. I feel like it's one of those situations where very very early on they said "we wAnt CeCe to be Transgendered Ali's brother!" But didn't keep that in mind during the rest of the show. (Side note: I did not intend to capitalize that A. My phone did it. My phone is also A. Or my phone is Tippi. Who knows??) 

To be fair, though, this show is hella complicated. We all know that. We analyze pictures of hands and legs and hoodies and veils. For an ABCF show, we've seen a lot of shit. They wanted that to happen from season one, they wanted CeCe to be Charlotte/Charles, they did a fairly good job of explaining it. There's only so much you can do on ABC family. Obviously it wasn't most people's number one choice - a lot of people expected her to just be Red Coat, after all - but for the writer's intentions, their long term game, they did okay. This is the equivalent of a C+ paper. It's not as awful as others I've seen, but I agree it's far from what it could have been. 

But Vanessa Ray. Let me tell you. She was raw as fuck and I have ten times more respect for her acting skills and her character after this episode. I always despised the idea of CeCe as A/RC/BW because I just didn't GET her. I didn't get why, when it seemed so obvious that Ali was trying to emulate CeCe, that CeCe kept chasing after Ali, too. That's what didn't make sense. And the transgender aspect, to some small degree, fixes that. Writing-wise, it was not amazing. Far from it.

BUT you have to be an awesome actress to be able to pull that off. To audition for a chic, breezy, attractive co-ed, and then to hear years later about the story they've been planning for your character? That's insane. She did an amazing job with what she was given. If she wasn't half as good as she was tonight, I wouldn't be coming back for 6B or anything else. Was it sloppy? Yep. What about this ABC family show about a bunch of high school kids and murder and a cyber stalker and an 11th and 12th grade that span multiple seasons is not sloppy? Be real here, guys - while this show has done some great things and has had some ridiculously funny/great writing and plotting at times, we've always known that there are plot holes galore. We've always known there are issues. But we keep on with it because number one, it's a great excuse to get drunk on Tuesdays, and number two, we've become invested in some way. I'm sticking around. I think they did just enough - not pandering to audiences and not something totally outlandish. 

So, there are dozens of hate threads out there. I guess I'm just hoping to have one that focuses on moving forward instead of quitting.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I fully admit to being a little bit harsh sometimes. Well, okay, less harsh and just, like, I don't care what people thing about me on the Internet because Internet. 

But I've been on the sub for a show I watch and someone said I come across as rude. I'm like okay, that wasn't my intention, but yeah I'm a little brash. Sure. I'm not going to kiss your ass. 

Then she goes on to say that if downvoting is a problem, it must be my fault, and seeing how my comments on that post were downvoted, obviously people agree with her... Etc etc. 

Look, I'm not perfect. I am not someone to apologize for my opinion, but none of my opinions were anything close to offensive and I've seen worse shit on that sub. But pseudo-teaming up against me on the Internet because I'm not all sparkles and rainbows is bullshit. I spent way too long agonizing over what people thought about me and obsessing over every word I said, letting social anxiety issues rule my life. Reddit, prior to this issue, has been my one respite. Now I get this crap and I feel awful and, like, am I really that bad? Is this girl just butthurt? I do have to try really hard not to come across harsh sometimes, it's a coping mechanism that I've developed after years of being trampled on and being nervous and I don't like it, but I far prefer it to never talking to anyone ever. 

So now I'm up at three in the morning upset because I've just been set back a few months/years of progress when it comes to letting myself have an opinion/debate. Because one person on the Internet said something. 

I just... UGH.

<TITLE> I [24f] have been with my bf [27m] for almost four years. We've talked about marriage before, but now his mom is divorcing again and he's super hesitant. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A little back story: my guy and I met four years ago, didn't start dating until a few months later. He's never had a girlfriend or even kissed a girl before me, whereas I had plenty of relationships before this that were usually really bad. My last ex was abusive. My bf and I have been living together pretty much since we started dating. 

Right around the time we got together, my parents went through a really messy divorce after 23ish years together. They had gone from perfectly happy to totally toxic to each other, plus both of them slowly descended into either drinking or narcotics and cheating. So there's that. I handled it fairly well because I was just tired of the fighting. 

My ex's parents divorced when he was a toddler. His mom is a little older, she's very Type A but also very "I can shop away my problems" and "in with the old, in with the new." She places extreme value on THINGS. She's also very very dramatic and tends to always play the victim. She can never ever admit that she's done wrong (she also very loudly proclaimed at dinner one night that when it comes to mental illness, you're either faking it or deserve to be locked up. She knows about my anxiety and depression, but probably doesn't remember because that's just how she is.) and it bothers me and also my boyfriend that she likes to guilt everyone into everything and act like she knows what's best for everyone. His dad is laid back, nerdy like my bf, and fairly quiet like my bf. Totally cool, not confrontational.  Obviously it did not last much longer than it took them to make two kids, my bf and his younger sister. 

Both of his parents remarried years later - his dad to someone very much like him, and his mom to an even older guy who does custom car stuff and is also really laid back. His mom and step dad have been having issues for years, but only really bad in the last year or two. 

Boyfriend and I have talked about marriage before. Within the first year of our relationship we had discussed it and knew that we were very serious about each other and that neither of us had any desire to ever date anyone else again. He's very close with my family while I'm slightly less close with his because I just don't see eye to eye with his mom on a lot of things. We've discussed where we'll eventually get married, he knows that my mom holds on to my grandma's old diamond that we're going to reset into a band I like. The whole deal. But over the last year he's been avoiding the topic, something that I really kinda took personally (I've never given him any reason to doubt our relationship) and something that seemed sort of out of left field. I didn't realize at the beginning of this year how bad his mom and stepdad were. I didn't know that they're only keeping it cordial in front of family. So now I sort of get the avoidance on the subject, but... 

His mom has made it official. She is moving out of the house she's lived in with bf's step-dad for twenty or so years. Don't get me wrong - I truly am sad for her and I can't imagine what she's going through. But at the same time, we all sort of saw this coming, at least in the last half a year, and as neither of them are willing to work on it, that's that. She told us last night at dinner that she's staying home from the annual camping trip (that we take on her birthday) so she can pack up and move. 

We're in the car on the way home and boyfriend blurts out "can you see why I'm hesitant to talk about marriage?" 

And yeah, to a certain degree, I can see. His mom is now twice divorced. My parents had a messy split. It hurts, when divorce happens. 

But how do I talk to him and make him realize that that's NOT US? That we are a VERY different couple (we're extremely communicative and insist on fixing our problems, we've had meetings to discuss our communication strategies and finances and how to better our relationship even when we're on 100% perfect terms) and that he can't let this instance, in which that one couple wasn't good for each other, completely tarnish his views on marriage? We've talked about getting married literally dozens of times before. I know it's hard for him to see his mom split. 

And the straw that's about to drop on the camel's back is this - I have a chronic illness. I'm disabled, not completely to the point of loss of mobility but I have many restrictions on what I can and cannot do. I have a lot of doctor's appointments that I can't even always get to. Due to my dad lying about losing his job (remember those narcotics I mentioned earlier? Yeah.) I just lost the great medical insurance I used to have. It was always our plan to get married before I was 26, because a: science says that couples who are together too long before getting married can have issues and b: that's when I stop getting covered under my parents insurance, so I could then use his. Also, we'll have been together 6 years, that's plenty of time. 

Now I'm worried he's going to throw things off and/or try and avoid marriage like the plague because of his mom's second divorce. I'm obviously a lot less concerned about the insurance than I am about the guy I want to spend my life with suddenly casting off the benefits to getting married.

How do I reassure him that our relationship has not changed? And how do I get him to disconnect his feelings over his moms divorce and marriage in general? I'm just worried that this guy that I see growing old with suddenly is convincing himself that he doesn't want the same things he used to and I don't know how to talk to him about this. Any advice appreciated.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've seen so many lists where people just rule out Ezra, Toby and Caleb at the very least because... Why? One I saw claimed that they had been in a room with the girls when A was present. How are we sure that was A? We know there have been so many people in black hoodies and multiple people in red coats, so how can you possibly rule out three major characters who have been around for a considerable amount of time just because they were in the same room as a black hoodied figure? Tbh like 90% of Rosewood has been in the same room as someone with a sketchy costume, the boyfriends are not exceptions. 

(Also I'm ready for your downvotes, but, besides Mona and Caleb, who have we seen that has considerable hacking skills? So many A things revolve around deleted hard drives and wiped phones and changed records, so who the fuck is doing it? Someone on the A team has skills. People immediately rule out Caleb because they think he's ~dreamy~ and they don't want it to be him, but he's got the abilities, for sure.) 

These three have always just seemed sketchy as fuck in one way or another at one point or another. Idk. Im not saying I definitely think one of them is A obviously or that they're all canoodling with A, but I don't think that their involvement can be vetoed because of a scene or two with a black hoodie.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are so many theories out there, let's hear them all. 

I think Charles is involved but maybe not Uber A. I honestly think that assuming BH and A are the same person is a little... Boring? A has so many contacts and is in so many places at once, and besides having a team, I feel like this whole situation must have come out of two or more people, meeting and sharing their grudges against the girls/Ali in particular, and then pushing each other to go after revenge. 

WANT: I want it to be Toby/Jenna/Lucas/Mona/Melissa, in some order. I know this is not a popular theory, but again adding to the fact that there could be so many black hoodies out there, as has been proven to us previously, any of these people have motivation. Significant motivation. And in one way or another, they've all met - Toby and Jenna through their history and their betrayal and being used by the girls, Lucas being shafted by Hannah and being tormented for years, Mona and her old A game and Lucas helping then, and Melissa angry with Spencer for destroying both of her serious relationships and messing with her life, intentionally or not, etc. 

THINK: I think it's a mixture of people. I think Rhys is definitely involved, and I think that some kind of switch happened - either Alison/Bethany or Jason/Charles. We still haven't figured out the possible twin thing, so I assume that whoever has a twin involved, we're going to learn that one of them is involved. 

DO NOT WANT: If it ends up being any combo of Wren/any dead character (Garrett, Ian, Jessica, whatever) I'm going to be disappointed 

I'm currently re-watching most of the important episodes to work out concrete clues, but all I can see right now is that the whole thing with the older generation, NAT... It all feels so disconnected now. And none of that feels like significant motivation to trap and torture 7 girls. 

If this post seems a little rambling/random, just understand that I drank about as much wine as the liars moms did tonight. NO RAGRETS.

<TEXT> Obviously not the ones we were hoping for - did some of you honestly believe they would reveal A in an episode that wasn't the finale? Do you even TV? - but a number of things anyway. 

- A (or the BH she sees) is someone Ali knows, and it has to be someone she knows fairly well, because that face. 

- Kenneth has obvs been missing for a while - but where? Assuming nefarious causes, we have to also assume that this is someone who has a vendetta against K. Any thoughts? 

- From the preview anyway, we know the Liars have heard BH's story (I'm still not convinced that BH and Charles are even the same person, because why can't Charles have a hoodie-d lackey? Or why can't BH be A and Charles is his accomplice/teammate?) and that it is not a pleasant story. Even if they're just trying to talk him down from the ledge, they know that this person had a serious personal motivation. Whether or not it was actually justified will depend on what we see next week, but they all seem genuinely concerned when it seems BH is about to jump. Not disappointed that BH won't rot in hell, but... Upset? Sad? Who would they be that upset about? I believe the redemption story, while maybe not justifying everything that has happened to them, might have some slight moral grounding

We've been told to focus on the Why, more than the Who. I've seen so many totally crackpot theories from people who just match up half a dozen seemingly related "clues". But most of the majorly spouted theories don't have the substantial personal motivation that would be required to do these things. 

Or it could "just be Rosewood, lolz" which, just in this one case, I doubt.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've only watched the series through once. I binge watched at night when I couldn't sleep. Before S5, I went back and tried to re-watch it all, but I'm... Easily distracted. 

I follow the story as far as current events go, and I remember 95% of earlier seasons, but I'm missing a few things. Like, it seems to be a pretty well-posted theory that Charles doesn't really suffer from any mental illness, that the reason he's locked up is because of... Something? Mrs D and something? But it doesn't sit right with me that an entire staff at a psychiatric hospital would all declare this boy insane with no reason. He clearly did some messed up shit when he was younger, but Ali mentions many times that the boy she remembers wasn't harmful or weird. I know that Rosewood is like 4% reality and 94% TV and 2% secret twins and ghosts but the back and forth seems to be confusing me. Can anyone explain what exactly is canon? 

Okay, and then as far as the old questions go - who's in the barrel, the Bethany thing, etc. I don't quite remember if Bethany was ever canonically related to the story or if it's all spec. And I don't remember how. 

Lastly, I keep seeing Wren and CeCe as suspects. I know CeCe's got her own motivations (the girl down the stairs, etc) but I don't remember what Wren's grudge might be. I remember him acting sketchy, but does that bump him up to being A, or does it just mean that at some point he might have been working with A? 

(Side note; I'm on a good amount of meds for a spinal condition/pain/migraines/etc so my memory is foggy on normal things. PLL has been tough for me for a while and hard to re-watch because tiny details don't stick.) 

So, if anyone either cares to answer questions or point me in the direction of a detailed, explanatory fan site, it would be much appreciated. Now I have a headache.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 24. Recently lost a pretty great job. Chronically ill with a degenerative spinal condition. Had a few months with very little pain, and now it's all flooding back. Making up for lost time. 

I have only briefly talked to a therapist about it, but in addition to depression and GAD, I most definitely have PTSD from the car accident that may have triggered my spinal condition. Every quick stop when someone else is driving is agony. My body starts to feel like... What are those orbs? The ones where you touch the glass? Google says they're plasma orbs. I feel like that. Except suddenly, someone puts both hands on the glass. It causes actual physical pain. I hate driving, but I hate being a passenger too. This happened November 2011. Has only gotten worse. 

Lost my job because I'm incapable of actually giving a shit. I just don't. I half ass everything because I just don't see the point of working my ass off in pain for a paycheck that will undoubtedly go solely to regular bills and medical. 

Pain has come back. What was once an "8" every day lowered down to a "3" for, actually, a good month or three. I have had very minor flares, but none lasting more than a day or so. It's slowly but surely creeping it's way back up to a constant 6/7. And the worst thing is, I had appointments - psych, Neurology, etc - but since I lost the job, I can't afford the copay. 

I'm extremely lucky to have been with my boyfriend for 3.5 years. He has offered to take the financial burden from me, going as far to say that even if I'm totally out of work, we can get by. I don't want him to have to do that, but I can't see myself struggling through a job search again. I would hate to even ask him for the copay for my appointments because it really isn't in budget. To top it off, he's emotionally just not there. He never has been. I know he loves me, but we've had a lot of issues, some related to my illness. He actually almost broke up with me once, told me he was unhappy, that I was a financial drain - come to find out that a lot of those exact thoughts were planted by a "friend" of his who wanted my boyfriend to be the pliant guy he could take advantage of. He would call my boyfriend and have him come over to help do repairs on his parents house, and then he'd leave him there to do all the work. None of our "friends" (I do that because none of them actually give a shit about me/us) liked this guy. Boyfriend got the picture and obviously we're still together. Things actually got better after that, but my boyfriend is an awful communicator who literally thinks that walking away from an argument or conversation will make it go away. We're working on it. So he's forthcoming with financial help, but emotionally distant. I want it the other way around, really. He's also a total workaholic, so we'll be watching a movie or with my family or whatever and I'll look over and he's remoting in to his computer and working. 

I have no real friends. Our friends all grew distant around the time I got sick, they hang out without us and don't bother to invite us, even though I've never turned down an invite because of my pain. I don't like to talk about it, either, so it's not like they don't want to hang out because I won't shut up about my problems. Boyfriends other friends recently stopped inviting him along too because apparently he turns down invites that I never knew about. And those friends blame me and my illness. I'm the bitch girlfriend who doesn't let him out of the house, right? Oh, except I invite people over all the time and push him to spend time with his friends because he doesn't make the effort. 

The friends I had before this relationship are all gone. One girl, my only real girl friend, I see her every year or so. My best childhood friend has been pretty great. He drunk texts me or just texts me randomly to say he's thinking of me and hopes I'm okay. I don't feel comfortable telling him that no, I am not okay, because he's the kind of person that would actually take an interest. He'd fly out here within days if I told him I needed him. I don't have feelings for him, never did, but his girlfriend is lucky to have a guy that is not only responsible, but fiercely loyal to his friends.

My parents are worthless when it comes to talking about this. I have a truly narcissistic mother who is too wrapped up in her own little world. She and my dad split four years ago, she cheated on him and then lied to my sister and I and said my dad cheated. We're not stupid. My mom magically had a boyfriend within weeks of separating from my dad, after 24 years of marriage. Anyway, she and her guy and my sister live in this big house near the beach, they always have people over, etc. She "forgets" to invite me, and reddit people have really helped me to realize that it's not about me, she's the problem. She doesn't want to invite me because despite what I'm going through, I love being social and talking to people. And often my illness comes up. She has a tendency to ignore my illness and turn everything back around to be about her and her oh-so-hard life. My sister has almost always been mommys girl, until she has recently started to come around. My sister is sometimes a pretty good support system. She was what the raised-by-narcissists community likes to call "fleas" from my mother. I'm sure you can get the picture. She's not bad.

My dad is worse. He put me on his insurance for work that he doesn't even have to pay for, and suddenly I should just do all the work in our relationship. He met a woman shortly after the divorce and they remarried. She has two daughters, a little younger than my sister and I, and they're pretty cool. But my stepmother is a little narcissistic too. And she gets a little paranoid, so she answers my dads phone and stuff, and I never get to just talk to him. I always was close with my dad until he got remarried, now his new family takes up his time. I spent two years being the only person to put effort into that relationship before I just stopped. It's up to him now. It's too emotionally draining for me to have to be the only person making an effort in my relationships. If I stopped trying to contact people and keep up with them - family, friends, anyone - I would just have no one. I already pretty much have no one. 

I was on the path to going back to therapy when I found out that my dad has been lying about not working. He works for the state through the union, so all his jobs are short contract. He swore he was going back to work in December. I now find out he hasn't worked since November. It's July. Which means that he could be removed from the list and I could lose insurance. He would rather lie to me and swear he's about to work than warn me. I only found out because he had to update his income in court for alimony and child support for my sister. So I could have potentially started therapy, only to show up just after I start trusting someone and get turned away for lack of insurance. I can't do that. 

I don't qualify for disability because I haven't earned enough "work credits".  I don't qualify for most kinds of aid because they require you to list the income of whoever is taking care of you, and my boyfriend makes okay money. There's no wiggle room - we live paycheck to paycheck just affording basics. They see that and say I'm fine and don't qualify. So I can't pay co-pays, can't see my doctors as often as I should be. I'm in pain, I'm depressed, I'm out of work. Repeat. 

Boyfriend offered to pay my copays. Said we can rearrange some bills and deposits, i need to take care of my health. Great. Again, he's making a financial offer in lieu of emotional support. 

I have a minor history of self harm. I don't feel the urge to lately, only because I don't actually want to feel anything. Not feeling things is probably what is best right now. 

TL;DR chronically ill 20-something with emotionally distant SO, shitty family, no friends, just lost my job, Depression/GAD/PTSD.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Alright, here's the story. 

My boyfriend and I have been together 3 1/2 years. Let's call him Sam. At the time, Sam was living with a few roommates, all friends, in a 4 bedroom townhouse that Sam's dad owns. I started staying over at his place from fairly early on, he'd drive me to work and we'd basically just come back and eat/sleep before the next day. He lived in the master suite and his roommates were all single dudes except one, whose girlfriend was across the country at school. Let's call him James and his girlfriend Carla. Carla would come into town and stay a few days at a time, mostly keep to herself. Not a big deal. Nobody ever voiced a problem with girls staying over and like I said, I kept to myself. I was very, very rarely there when Sam wasn't, I would go home to my parents place. Flash forward a few months, we all move out. 

Flash forward another year and a half, and the townhouse is available again. I'm out of work (I got a bad spinal diagnosis in our time away) so it makes sense for us to take on a roommate or two and save money. We reach out. James wants to move back in, as does our other friend Ian. At this point, Carla is still in school, so Sam and I are effectively living with two NEAT, QUIET professionals/bachelors. We provided all the furniture for common areas, all the dishes, etc. It goes pretty well for a while. Carla moves back about 8 months ago. A few months later, Ian decides to move back in with his parents. Not a problem. James, Sam, and I have a meeting where James is very clear that Carla does not want to live with him (traditional parents, money, etc. she works about an hour away and has her own place out there in addition to her room at her parents place, which is near to here). Okay, so the three of us resign for a month to month lease. 

Soon after, we sign a roommate agreement that goes over taking care of the common spaces, quiet hours, etc. One specific clause is that if a roommate has a potential guest that is staying more than 10 consecutive days, that tenant has to ask the landlord and some arrangement has to be made regarding bills and rent. 

Today is day 10. That might be fine if Carla still kept to herself, but she has not. Oh, dear god. 

She stomps up and down stairs, she never shuts up (and not only does she constantly yell, she puts on this false cutest stupid voice and it's annoying as hell). She brings her friends over in the middle of the day, she has a key and let's herself in whenever. She takes up the entire kitchen during the day (the entire pretty big kitchen) for hours at a time. She's here constantly. Like I said, ten days straight, and it's not like she goes away for a week after times like that - she's here probably 20-25 days out of the month. 

We tried having a discussion with him once, about her being over for a week straight and the change in bills, and he brushed us off and said it was a one time thing because she had some test for her internship thing. Okay, we let it slide, he knew it was an issue. It's only gotten worse since then. She's practically moved in. She has no regard for Sam and I, and she and James play stuff at loud volume, hoard dirty dishes, don't sweep or clean any of the common spaces, etc. She does her laundry here, monopolizing the machines for hours. She uses our cooking stuff (mixing bowls, pots, etc) to store huge batches of food in the fridge. We then can't cook with the things we need. Sam and I know we want our own place, and health-wise I'm finally at a place where I can start working again, but it's not happening any time soon, financially. James has made it clear that he won't move out until we do. He's also had multiple occasions where he basically throws parties at the house with no prior warning, sometimes Sam and I come home from a long day of errands and crap and just want to watch a movie in the living room, on our couch, on our tv, but we walk in to 15 people crowding our living room and either a booming movie or a bunch of people partying. Like, at least ask if it's cool. They're mostly mutual friends. We might have even liked to have join. But we don't get so much as a courtesy text. 

What do we say to him? We can't really just knock on his door and talk because she's always here. He's also fairly confrontational and we're worried he'll get super passive aggressive again; he tends to do that. But they're not being considerate of our space or the common spaces, and like, if she had a key for emergencies or was here once in a while, fine. But when she's making it so that I can't make my own meals everyday, it's too much. We would never have agreed to live with another couple. It's gotten to the point where I'm miserable living here, Sam hates it too. We're afraid of pissing off James because he and Sam were like best friends once, but this is insane. 

EDIT: TL;DR; my boyfriend and I's roommate was pretty cool, his girlfriend moved back, now they're an amalgam of annoying behaviors to the point of making us miserable.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everyone knows the exit/entrance is a clusterfuck. Boyfriend and I are probably going VIP next year for various reasons, but what about premier parking? How much did it cost, how fast did you arrive/leave, etc. 

Saturday on the way out, we left at like 4. We literally didn't get back to our hotel until like 9. That's unacceptable for me. If premier is faster, we may end up going for that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hiiii friends. I was lucky enough to not get the withdrawals until this morning... But by this point the feels have accumulated and I am already planning next year. 

My question is really posed for anyone who did VIP this year. Was it worth it? A lot of people were complaining about the giant price hike this year, but from what I saw, it looks like they included a lot more stuff too. (I saw something about free drinks?) 

Just looking for a first-hand (or second, even) account of whether or not it was worth it. For me, it might be worth it for parking and entrance alone, everything else would just be bonus. My guy is sort of impatient and the parking situation getting out was just insane. We literally left the gates at 4:30 one morning and didn't get onto the freeway until almost 8. It sort of ruined the sunrise vibes for both of us. 

Sunday we did Valet, which was infinitely better, but for $60 extra for that, plus maybe faster entrance, plus places to sit (I'm disabled but when I contacted insomniac they wanted me to jump through a billion hurdles just to prove I needed a chair here and there)... It may be worth it. Boyfriend has a decent salaried job and I'm looking to hire into an okay job too, so while we don't have a ton of disposable income, we could definitely make it work if we thought it was worth it. 

Thanks in advance for all replies :) looking forward to next year already!

<TEXT> A little context - S (Fiance) and I have been together 3 1/2 years. We've talked about marriage a few zillion times, and while he hasn't proposed yet, we know we're on the way there. We're just both really financially nitpicky and want to make sure we can afford exactly what we want before he proposes and we get married. We've lived together for almost all of our relationship, mostly because I was escaping my own NMom and a pending divorce between my parents, plus S lives on his own and it just sort of worked out. 

In the beginning of our relationship, S's Mom (we'll call her N, fitting) was super super nice to me, like all the time. We got lunch a few times, we seemed to really get along. It didn't stay like that. It never does, in laws are interesting, but S is sort of a Momma's Boy to begin with, and he doesn't see the things she does. I mean, he SEES them, but he doesn't think her behavior is out of the norm. She was a little older when she had S and his sister. Married late, divorced while the kids were toddlers, remarried fairly shortly after. She's gone slowly weirder and weirder, in terms of her attitude towards me. Sometimes she's still super nice and almost overtly so, but other times she'll pick fun in a sort of stuck-up, holier-than-thou, condescending sort of way. She's fairly well off, she retired quite some time ago. She managed a bank for a long time, so she thinks she's the know-all, end-all when it comes to financial knowledge and what will work best for S and myself, even though our situation right now is not anything she's ever had to deal with (I have a serious chronic illness/pain syndrome, and though I manage to work and live around it, it's the bills and things that she acts like she can counsel us on). She gets uppity if we ever make a decision that she doesn't agree with. 

To add to it, she's got some very archaic opinions about mental illness. I suffer from depression and anxiety and 

But - here's the kicker. She finally did something that I DO NOT agree with at all, and S doesn't see what's wrong with it. She wants to build onto her house, for whatever reason. It's just her and her husband and on and off, S's sister, but it's a three bedroom place with plenty of room. Here's the thing - she initially intended this addition as a place for S and I to live. Full time. 

What? 

Does she think that between her condescending bullshit and the jokes and the second-guessing and the fact that S tends to not stand up for me when he needs to... I mean, does she honestly think that we would live with her? She knows we're going to get married, though she likes to avoid the subject like the plague. I just don't get it. Once I made it abundantly clear that under no circumstances would I feel comfortable living with his mom, S backed off. He's just off the opinion that it makes sense for multiple generations to live together, but he knows I'm a fairly private person and that I'm not at all interested in that sort of situation. 

However, she still needed S - and his sister - to put their names on the loan in order to get the loan, because she's retired and has no real income. So it's like, either way our credit is screwed, because even if she makes the payments like she's supposed to, which she might, that line of credit is going to count toward's S's credit score, and since I'm a nanny and get paid under the table... that's not going to look good when we go to buy a house or a car somewhere down the line. "Oh, but your name is on this loan for x amount of dollars" (I don't know the exact amount, but it's something like 250k). Just... 

bullshit. So mad. 

So now, even though S and I are good with money, we pay all our bills, we have a decent savings for people our age, etc... we're going to run into trouble when we go to get a car or house because his mom kept barreling through with a house addition she didn't need. 

And if it all gets finished and S tries to talk me into moving in with his mother/family, he can go live up there by himself. Ugh. He's an enabler, and he sort of sees it, but Mommy Knows Best, I guess. He's gotten better than he used to be (DO NOT get me started on the camping trips... I love camping but I would gladly never camp with them again) but he's not making much of an effort to change shit. I don't know.

UGH.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, god. 

I'm 23, F. My mom and I never had the best relationship growing up, obviously, she liked to kick me out of the house and tell me to never come back, and then come back to me days later, when friends and family asked where I was, crying and begging for me to come back because she "missed me", aka because she realized that people were not sympathizing with her. My parents split ~4 years ago, my dad wasn't a great guy to begin with (compulsive liar, vicodin addict, etc) but they were just toxic to each other. 

Since the split, my mom seems to have reverted back to the developmental stage where she was before she met my dad - 17, barefoot, lost on the beach. Not a good place for a mid-40's woman to be, but, she's been happier in the last few years and for a while, that seemed like enough. I moved out with my boyfriend around the time she and my dad split, so that was a nice departure too. She has definitely had her quips (minimizing my major Chronic Illness diagnosis and comparing it to the fact that she had to move offices, constantly telling me what to do and what's best for me despite the fact that she's horribly financially irresponsible, etc) but the last few years since I left and she and my dad split have been... not so bad. 

Ha. 

So we're all on a family vacation a few weekends ago, one we do every year and have done for the last few decades, since before I was born. There's a bar on the island that gives out these giant straw hats to anyone who orders these fairly strong drinks. It's a tourist bit, but one that I counted my way up to, heading into MY 21st birthday. Except my mom had promised to take me for years and never did. Instead, I went when I was 23, with my boyfriend, after giving up on that trip with my mom. Not super important, I wasn't looking for mommy bonding time, but she's a professional at making commitments and then bailing. 

So, my turn was gone. My sister, however, turned 21 this year and my mom made a huge deal about it, telling everyone it was "tradition" that when her girls turned 21, she'd take us for one and we'd bar hop and have a girls night with whoever else wanted to go. What? Yeah, there are two daughters. You bailed on one and went all out for the princess and lied to anyone within earshot even though I was, you know, RIGHT THERE and knew she was full of shit. 

So I ignore that and I'm like "you know what, she's been drinking, if she wants to attempt to feel good about our relationship I'll allow her to harbor under that delusion for a little bit." But then it gets weird. We're talking about eyes - my mom, my sister, my sister's son's adoptive mother, and myself. We're talking about eyes when my mom like points her finger right in my face and starts talking about how she's always been jealous of my eyes. They're not really anything special - green. There are two little brown flecks in each eye (which I recently found out are actually benign growths that could have potentially been cancerous. But that doesn't matter to mommy, who thinks they're "pretty"). But she was like aggressive about it. Okay. So I brush it off because A: It's weird and B: I don't want to feed into her shit right now, so that's that. 

Except it gets me thinking - about other times she's been weirdly jealous of me and has said it, fairly clearly, drunk or not. Things about my money (I have none, I'm a full time nanny, I'm just actually responsible with my money), my boyfriend (27, 6'3, more than a bit nerdy but fairly good looking), my things (like I said, I'm actually a pretty good saver), all of it. I don't know. 

I think the idea of anyone being jealous of me or my life is a joke on high magnitude, but it's starting to make me uncomfortable. Maybe that's been an issue with her all along? I don't know. Just figured that if I had an optimal sounding board, this was it. Maybe someone else has some experience like this and can make me feel a little less crazy?

<TEXT> Okay, my boyfriend and I are Disneyland Passholders. We have been for years, before that I was a Passholder with my family, etc. My mom had one up until a year ago, when she stopped making payments. She has a habit of going shopping and blowing most of her spending money for a month and then claiming she's destitute and almost homeless and totally broke, yet she shows off new shoes every other week. Yeah, okay. 

So last week we're in the car talking about relationship stuff and how our significant others stress us out, and she's telling me how her boyfriend is stubborn, and I'm saying mine is too (side note: she's like "no Shane's a good guy, you don't know what you're talking about, my boyfriend is MUCH worse" and I'm just like yawn okay yeah yeah). I bring up this time at Disneyland a few months ago and she immediately sighs this huge dramatic sigh and when I stop to let her let out whatever it is she's going to guilt me about, she gestures for me to keep going, so I tell her about an argument and then it's done. I wait for her to respond or something and she just does another dramatic sigh and is like "I miss Disneyland, that's just one more thing I don't get to have in life." 

Uh, bitch, 'scuse me. I budget my money effectively after paying hundreds of dollars in ongoing medical bills so that I can pay fifty bucks a month to do something that makes me happy. You stopped making payments for no other reason than being addicted to spending money. You live in a giant two story house less than a mile from the beach, your boyfriend cooks and cleans for you every night, you're constantly shopping and buying new shit, you just took two vacations and are going on another one. But I mention Disneyland and all of a sudden, you have nothing? Because I have ONE thing that I'm proud to be able to do? Nope nope nope nope nope 

Then a few days later I'm laying on the floor at my nephews adoptive family's house. I have a spinal condition so I have fairly constant back pain but that day it was debilitating, laying on the floor and taking a pain pill are the only things that help. She scoots over to me on the floor and almost looks like she gives a shit about my pain, then starts talking about how she was destitute and couldn't put fuel in her car the other day so she got stuck at work for a whole thirty minutes, so I should just remember that I really have it easy.

<TEXT> I've been depressed for as long as I can remember - even as early as Elementary school I've shown symptoms, and there's a huge percentage of depressed people in my family. I was fairly emotional during high school, like a lot of kids, but most of the time I still didn't feel like my head was really in it. I very nearly flunked out, but continuation school and my mom threatening to kick me out at 15 got me to finish. I dabbled in college courses, but never went back and I don't think I earned more than three units in something like three semesters. I had thought it would be a new beginning, something I could dive into, head first, but I hated it. I hated the people, the professors, the coursework. I had always wanted to be a writer, a novelist, but my passion for writing started to die off around that time. It's been a slow, shitty descent since then. 

I'm now newly 24, I've been in a serious relationship for a little over three years. I'd been in two awful ones before that, both abusive, so this guy is a breath of fresh air. He's really the only person that has made me feel truly, unconditionally loved. And that's why my depression is that much worse. His family has practically zero history of mental illness, and what is there gets swept under the rug. I've actually sat at a table, next to his mother (who doesn't know I'm depressed) while she made loud proclamations that people with mental illnesses shouldn't be allowed to own guns or have children. I've been steadily, secretly in total dislike for her since then. 

I just don't give a shit anymore. I don't. I have so many things to look forward to, I know that - my boyfriend and I are planning on buying a house by the end of the year, we're probably going to get married within a year or so. The few times over the last few years that I've felt real, in-your-face emotions, it's been with him. And yeah, sometimes that's anger, but mostly love. Mostly happy. But I'm so sick of the day in and day out. I've got a chronic spinal condition, it will never go away and I'm in near constant pain. It drives me crazy, knowing that I'll literally never again do anything without first thinking about my condition, about the needs of a stupid glitch in my spine above what I want to do. 

I self-harmed in December. I won't say much more than that about it, just that I didn't immediately regret it. Still sort of don't. I know it upset my boyfriend, and I think that's the reason I haven't done it again. I hadn't done it since high school, nine years before, and I don't plan on doing it again. It was just like a switch. I felt nothing, nothing, nothing, and then one morning I woke up and I felt everything all at once, a glimmer of happiness among waves of crushing sadness, white-hot anger, so bad I wanted to smash things, break things. That very afternoon, I was back to nothingness, or near-nothingness. You know how it is. Sometimes you feel little things throughout the day that almost make you feel like you're having a good day, until you look back on the week behind you and literally cared so less about it, in hindsight, that you can't remember a damn thing that happened. 

I know I need to go back to a psychiatrist, I know I should be medicated. But I procrastinate and I feel like, what, going and talking to someone and taking pills is going to magically fix me? And I'll be able to commit to things and feel normal? That's never going to happen, for me, so why bother? 

I just feel like I'm spending my life waiting to get better when that may never happen, and what then? I wake up in the morning and I can't wait to just go back to sleep, to pass the time. The monotony of daily life is stifling. I do look forward to weekends, to getting things done and deflating and just spending some time with my guy, but as soon as Sunday morning hits and I realize it's basically back to the work week again, I lose whatever grip on normalcy I might have had. 

I'm just so, so tired. Of everything.  </TEXT>

Not helping, just made me high. Then Norco, 7.5, still just made me fuzzy, but did take away a little pain. They finally put me on Percocet (5mg, but "as needed" up to 4 a  day, 30 in a month). I'm in one hell of a lot of pain. I'd say my daily average is an 8, sometimes dipping down to a 5 for a little while. Now that my pain is consistently worse, I have even worse "spikes", usually at night. Usually when I go into the ER, they're super supportive. Consider my file "Flagged". My history shows degenerative spinal issues, extensive nerve damage, and explains that they're still testing because I have other, unexplained pain/sensory disturbances that don't mesh with my diagnoses. Anyway, they usually put me in a dark, quiet room and give me morphine, which helps. It literally takes 1-2mg of Morphine an hour to get me down to a 2, which sucks. 

But I wasn't able to work for a long time, so I couldn't pay my copays. I owed something like 800 to the hospital, it was getting sent to collections, and since my boyfriend is supporting us both, (and outright offered to pay my bills, bless his lil heart) it meant that we just paid what we can, when we can. It's... slightly better now. But I've been avoiding doctors, I've been avoiding pain management of any kind (I went a month without a pain pill because I constantly thought "there were be worse nights" and didn't want to pay the $40 copay monthly to see my PM team and then refill my prescription on top of that). I hate being a financial burden, but now I realize I've become an emotional burden. He hates seeing me in pain, I hate being in pain. I have pain that makes me literally tear my hair out, but I have been refusing to manage my pain, even after my boyfriend begs me to handle it. 

It's not cool. I have a new pain in my leg as well - usually they're shooting nerve pains from hip to knee and knee to ankle, but this is just a throbbing pain that feels like it's in my femur. Middle of my leg. I know I should get an MRI (I clearly have bad luck with health and need a new set of MRIs anyway) but I know that's going to cost $40 for the specialist visit, and $40 for the imaging center visit. 

I don't know what I'm looking for. Reassurance. Ways you've taught yourself to think of your own pain first. I just bury it and I'm not effectively taking care of myself and that's not good.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> NDad, LC. Calls to complain because... kind of a long one. [support] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-01 00:35:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was diagnosed with a degenerative spinal condition a little less than a year ago. I'm 23, but my body basically behaves like I'm 85 - bad joints, snaps, slipped discs, weak spine/back, loss of sensation, total numbness, partial paralysis that comes and goes, etc. Really fun stuff. 

Both of my parents are total Ns, always have been. My father is also the biggest liar I've ever met in my life. However, their narcissism somehow bonded them together for 23 years or so, until their messy divorce three years ago. My dad got remarried very soon after, my mother didn't. She's a whole different ball game, but I digress. 

In the year before my NDad got remarried, he was actually really supportive - this was all before I got sick. If I was short for rent, he would lend me money and tell me not to worry about repaying (with, of course, the tone that he was all but saving my life and if he didn't lend me $150, I'd be a homeless crank addict or something). But still, that counted for something, and there would be brief periods of time where he'd sit and talk to me without being a total dick. 

Then he got engaged to my Stepmom, who I have come to realize is just about as narcissistic as he is. It had been eight months since I'd needed help (due to ongoing doctor's appointments to try and figure out what's wrong with me, by the way. I'm not just an irresponsible spender, we spent months going to specialists trying to diagnose me) and I'd asked for sixty bucks to float for groceries until my long-time boyfriend got his next check. My dad agreed, and his wife... denied it. She said, directly in front of me, that parents shouldn't support their children in any way after they turn 18. (She says this while supporting her two daughters, of course.) And besides, they have to save up for the wedding, and every dollar counts. 

Okay, fine. Ramen it was. I started realizing that my Stepmom is both an enabler and a narcissist, a classic combo I was coming to realize would cause problems for them and for my dad and I, since it's that sort of behavior that split my parents up. She also is really weird about communication. Like, she answers my dad's phone and his texts, even when I address them to him (i.e. Hey Dad, just wondering what you guys are up to next weekend, we've got a free day and would like to see you and the girls. I get back: Hey girly! We're free Saturday! You should come out and BBQ with us!) Which, okay, fine. But I'm texting my dad to talk to my dad. And it's ALWAYS her responding unless I call him during the day while he's at work, and then he rarely answers. 

They get married, things seem fine. For a few months, it even seems like they care. Then I get my diagnosis. That day, she comes to pick me up because I didn't want to be home alone (it's a far drive, I was fairly surprised she did it) and I spend the day there until my boyfriend gets off work late and comes to get me. I'm in shock, sure, but I cry once or twice. But she's SOBBING. This woman who I've known for like a year and a half and who has been a little on the weird side is acting like this is her personal tragedy. 

A few weeks later I go back, we're watching some bridal show. My dad just got home from work and is sitting next to me, and I make an offhand comment about getting married before I end up in a wheelchair, which is highly likely for people with my condition. 

They EXPLODE. At first I thought the dog shit in her shoes, because she yelped so loudly. They chastised me for "condemning myself" and told me as long as I thought positive, everything "would be just fine, like now". Uh, okay. I understand she's fairly religious and spreads her mantra of positivity and prayer, but prayer isn't going to take my spinal issues away, and I'm just being realistic in saying I want to marry my guy while I can still dance with him. She starts throwing a fit about scaring her and scaring the girls, she's clutching at her chest, my dad chastises me about talking "like that". I've never been a sunshine and rainbows person to begin with, my dad knows I sort of tell it like it is or don't say anything at all. But all of the sudden, my illness and my life choice is a personal slight on them again. 

At this point, we're LC. My dad doesn't answer his phone, and she stops answering it for him. She stops answering half the time too, or she's really clipped and distant. Okay, fine. At one point, I ask for a loan - just $100 to keep my bills from going to collections and screwing up my credit. I tell him I've got a babysitting job coming up and I'll give him all $120 back in two weeks, I just need to cover this $100 ER copay. He sighs, and says he can't. They're having money troubles. It's been really hard. He's not making as much as he used to. This is all following the last time I saw him, about a month before this, in which he told me he got a promotion. That was probably a lie, the money troubles were also definitely a lie, because when I went out two weeks later, they had a brand new car in the driveway. He claims they paid it with my stepmoms tax refund, but she's not working, and even on unemployment, she wouldn't be getting THAT much in taxes back. He outright bought a car. Like, a $23,000 car. They don't pay rent, they live with her mother. But he couldn't float me $100 for two weeks. Oh, and two weeks later, they took a big vacation to Las Vegas for their anniversary. Posted pictures on Facebook. But, you know, they're broke! 

Things were just starting to be okay again (still LC, but we'd gone over there for Independence Day and only had one tiff) when I get a phone call from my dad, middle of a Tuesday. It's so out of the ordinary that I seriously think I'm dreaming and that my meds have finally dissolved my brain. Nope, I answer it and it's my dad, sounding tired. I ask him what's up, and he goes into this spiel about the hospital calling him about me. I am behind on payments (mostly because I couldn't work at the time, with three doctor's appointments a week and PT on top of that, and those copays alone ate up whatever was left from my boyfriend's income supporting the both of us). Because he's the "responsible party" on my insurance, they're nagging him. I ask how many times they've called. He says three times in the last two weeks. Oh, bother! 

I tell him I'll take care of it, I'll call them and tell them not to call him. His response? "You better, or I'm going to get on your ass about this. These phone calls are really stressing me out at work." Oh, I'm sorry. I lost it. Absolutely effing lost it. I told him, "Well, maybe collectors wouldn't be on both of our asses if I had a family member somewhere who could float me $100, but, you know, I guess they're all too busy buying new cars and taking expensive vacations to do something like that." I know he makes a lot of money. And he doesn't have to spend much. I started crying, which I rarely do, and I told him if he really wanted to get the calls to stop, he could have waited three days to buy his new effing car and he'd have made twenty bucks, to boot. I told him I was pissed that he lied to me, but even more pissed that he went from trying to help out despite being absent, to just being absent and being a dick about it. I stayed on the line, heavy breathing, and he just continued on with the conversation like nothing had happened. He said next time they called, he'd tell them to stop calling him. He asked how i was doing. I laid it on thick - I'm seeing two Neurosurgeons who probably won't operate on me because the surgery is super dangerous, I have eleven doctor's appointments in the next month and a half, I can't get upstairs without assistance, and oh, I have no support system because apparently my illness makes my family "uncomfortable" (my mom's words, not his, but still. Relevant.) Again, nothing. We said goodby and hung up. Oddest phone call of my life. 

I stared at the phone and was actually amazed. He wasted twenty whole minutes of his precious time, talking to me. I mean, it wasn't pleasant by any means, but it's twenty minutes. Dear Lord. Someone call a doctor. 

It really just blows my mind that a father can watch his daughter get sick, and distance himself and lie to her and become LESS helpful than before. The funny thing is, I'd love to blame it on my stepmom, but he's always been this way, and when I first got sick she was actually surprisingly, one of my best sources of emotional support. She'd pick me up from an hour and a half away and take me out to window shop or eat, or just hang out at the house with me. That stopped eventually, but still. 

My form of the condition is the least predictable. I could never have worsening of symptoms again, or I could die in my sleep from paralysis of my upper body, which would just stop my lungs from working. I could be paralyzed in three hours or slowly get better. But I've gotten slowly worse over the last ten months, and for the most part, if symptoms increase, they'll keep increasing. I had so many dreams for myself that I mourn the loss of. If this gets really bad, I won't be able to have kids, I won't be able to dress myself or read a book. Like, I need support. That is something I have come to accept, since I'm normally someone who HATES asking for help. I know sometimes I have to, but I despise it. But I need my dad right now. 

Okay, long post over. What the hell do I do? Is there a way to tell my dad to snap the hell out of it, that I don't care about the money, I just hate being lied to and pushed away when I most need someone? My dad and I used to be a lot closer, before he moved out to be with my stepmom. We got tattoos on my 19th birthday to piss off my mom, I was very much a daddy's girl growing up. He's changed. Even my chart-topping Nmom asks how I'm doing, 5% of the time that we talk. She and I had a very strained relationship when I was younger because I frequently called her out on her behavior, but I never saw it in my dad until I was maybe 19, 20, and moving out of the house for the first time. 

How do you deal with that? I haven't always seen him like this. It's like losing him, but he's just 80 miles away. Ugh. This is when I most need him to not be a jackass, to just call me and check in and, I don't know, treat me a fifth as well as he now treats his (younger) stepdaughters. Just... ugh. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Painful hand tremors? What? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I've had hand tremors before. I've had hand joint pain before. But I'm now venturing into a previously undiscovered (by me, at least) world of painful hand tremors. They hurt when they twitch. They sometimes just stop working correctly. I drop stuff constantly. But it HURTS. Every joint feels like it's on fire. Every tendon and nerve and muscle has electric-type pain. It hurts when they twitch, it hurts when they briefly stop twitching. And the twitching makes them hurt MORE. My joints in my hands feel like they're creaking. And I've got a prickly sensation from my wrists to fingertips whenever my hands move, but that could be any number of my chronic conditions. Meh. 

Just sort of venting and seeing what secrets you guys might have for hand pain. It's new, like this. This sucks.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm 23. I've been a little "chubby" for most of my life, but was a pretty good/healthy weight until Junior year of high school. I just got lazy. I didn't want to walk the four blocks home from school. Throughout college, I was just too lazy to go to class. I started putting weight on, went from 5'5 135 lbs when I was around 16, to 160-ish when I was around 20. I've recently been diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue, in addition to a spinal condition, which explains some of that, and which has also put my weight over 190 at one point. I am 5'7 now, so a tad taller, but 190 is way over what I want to be. 

I have struggled with binge eating for a decade, but I think I'm finally recovering from that because I've gone from binging 2500+ calories every other day, to just finding a snack when I feel like I want to binge. While I have been eating healthier over the past few months, I slip up constantly. I bought a treadmill but can hardly ever convince myself to get on it. "Tomorrow" is my mantra. I've been convincing myself to put my fitness aside to deal with my back, but that's not really it, either. I don't know what it is. I don't stick to anything for more than a couple of weeks. I give in at the slightest sign of an unhealthy meal, and instead of getting back on track, I just give up. 

So, loseit, what has kept you on track? What tricks, systems, or motivators do you have that have kept you from slipping again and again? I'm hardly making progress. The fifteen or so pounds that I have lost, I've only lost since I've stopped binging, and now I've been hovering around the same weight for months.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> TW Wasn't technically raised by her, but my relatively new NStepmother is... interesting. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Mother is a wonderfully fantastical narcissist. I've spent the last two and a half years of NOT living with her, recovering from living with her, and even now when I see her, I'm constantly annoyed. My parents split just before I moved out, and it was hard on the whole family, but of course my mother made it about her. Now, it's agreed on by my sister and the rest of our family that it was for the best. Our parents were toxic together - my dad had anger issues that have since mostly resolved, mostly because my mother turned her N into being an explosive drama queen. 

My stepmom, however, is a different story. Don't get me wrong. I love her, she's family, and she is so much better for my dad than my mom was. She has two great daughters who complain about her just as much as any kids would. But... it has gone a step too far. I got a serious diagnosis back in September. Because my mom has a tendency to blow things up and make them about her, I talked to my dad first and immediately got picked up by my stepmom to go out to his house for the rest of the day, since I was highly upset and didn't trust myself to be home alone (history of mild self-harm, a few years clean and didn't want to relapse). She picked me up, asked plenty of thoughtful questions, and seemed to be really reassuring. The next day, my mom made a mess of things. So I started going out to my dad's more, and since my stepmom wasn't working, we spent a lot of time together, at which point her real feelings came out. 

Her family is pretty religious, old Argentinian and Mexican catholics. We've had plenty of family friends that have been the same, but most know to keep their religion separate from friendships. My stepmom doesn't necessarily have that problem, but she has a problem understanding that "faith" and "positive thoughts" are not going to heal me. I'm an atheist, and a firm believer in good science. When I got my diagnosis, the best thing for me to do was research. I would tell her little bits, not being too crazy with details. 

But my dad came home from work one week (he stays out at stateline four days a week, then comes home for three) and I was out there. My boyfriend hadn't come to pick me up yet, so I was watching a wedding show with my stepsisters. I had finally gotten to the point where I was making a "list" of things I wouldn't let my condition take away from me - mostly relationships and family, letting myself be happy, etc. But this was the first physical one. "I don't want to go down the aisle in a wheelchair." A lovely little FLEA I picked up from my childhood, sure, but a valid fear of mine - I have always dreamed of my wedding/marriage, and now that I've found the guy I'm 99% sure I'm going to spend my life with, I've already started sort of planning and my plan does not involved being limited with dress choices, venue choices, with not being able to have a first dance (or any dance)... you know. It IS a valid fear. 

But they both BLEW UP. Nstepmom started shouting that I shouldn't say those things, that they'll NEVER happen to me, that I just need to listen to her and have faith and stay positive... it's like, if they were upset by it, fine. It's a touchy subject and it was still pretty new. But to get angry at me for not having the same attitude/faith/whatever that they had... it still bothers me. 

She also, when my sister got pregnant months before that, tried to convince my sister to not put the baby up for adoption, despite my pleas to NOT DO THAT. My sister was only 19 when she gave birth, it was extremely hard on her to begin with because due to a hormonal issue, she had bleeding that seemed like periods, so she just thought she was putting on freshman college weight until she got bloodwork done at a routine doctor's appointment and they asked if she knew she was pregnant. She hadn't known then, and she was literally already 30 weeks pregnant. She just looked like she'd put on a little weight. She knew almost immediately that adoption was the only choice for her and found a wonderful family that helped her choose open adoption, so that we're all still a big part of the baby's life - except my dad and stepmom, since they so heavily pressured my sister to keep the baby that she's very LC with the both of them. She'll only see them if I'm there, now, and they still pressure her about seeing the baby. My stepmom, also, has lied about things she's said to my sister and I, to my father. She pressured my sister in private, and when my dad stopped within a few weeks, she didn't - but she told him she did. But then she'd text me, text my sister, call us, just wanting to "catch up" but in minutes she'd be crying, throwing a fit, begging us to change the decision. She still does this sometimes, and my nephew was born over nine months ago. 

Most of the time, she's fine. But she's extremely overbearing and self-righteous to a fault, when something doesn't go her way. She knows that it's this pressure from her, and her pressuring my father into talking about it, that is causing my sister to keep them from seeing the baby. She doesn't want that kind of drama with the adoptive family, who are wonderful to all of us because they know we support my sister's decision. 

It's just whack. She's normally pretty cool but other times, she can't get over the fact that I think differently from her sometimes. She still won't give up with my diagnosis, though it's been over half a year, and I'm just terrified of what will happen when things get worse and I have to explain that I'm in serious medical trouble. She's the kind of person that doesn't just 'pray for you', she holds unwanted candlelight vigils at hospital bedsides. I purposefully didn't tell my dad I was at the hospital a few weeks ago because I knew it would cause drama, despite the fact that my dad is the only one I wanted to call (besides my boyfriend, who was already there since he'd literally carried me to the car and then into the ER).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> To anyone else, this could be construed as a "coping tactic", but not if you knew my mother... 

She was always the victim, always storming off in an argument. My dad had anger issues when I was younger, but he never hit me - my mom did, and yet if my dad ever got angry at all, she'd make a huge scene and act like he was trying to attack her. On a road trip one time, she reached back, grabbed my hair, and pulled me from the back seat into the front, hitting me over and over again until my dad could pull the car over and make her get out for a while because she was getting too far. She snapped the seatbelt out of our Chevy van. I don't have to tell you how strong that is. It wasn't the only time she got that violent. 

She's always been like this. Prom dress shopping was all about what she wanted. She wanted me to be in Drill Team in high school because that's what she did. She always had stories about her parties and friends, and even when I got older, she'd ask me why I wasn't out on weekends and accuse me of turning away friends and being a "loner on purpose". Then she'd spend days praising how I wasn't drinking or getting into trouble. Repeat. She often had parties at my house for my friends, with jello shots or beer pong or whatever. Most of these started when I was 18, but birthday parties before that were always huge spectacles. Not that I'd complain, but it was like whenever she picked me up from a party, she had to observe, and mine had to be the best. She wanted to be Super Mom, not for me but so that she could prove something. When I moved out at 20, she acted like it was a personal affront to her despite the fact that she'd recently divorced my dad (who she cheated on, while telling my sister and I that HE had cheated on HER) and had quickly begun dating another man. He's great, I don't know how he puts up with her. She openly flirts with my boyfriend, praises him, and tells me I don't deserve him. UGH. More of that fun stuff. Now that I'm older and moved out and have a successful, loving relationship, it has almost gotten worse. 

I'm 23 now, and about six months ago I was diagnosed with a rare, unpredictable spinal condition. Because it's so rare, not a lot of research has been done on it. I'd been having pain and numbness and weakness and unbearable headaches for over a year, but I hadn't had insurance. Every time I complained about pain at her house, she would whine about any headache or toothache or fatigue she had and try and one-up me. You know the deal. So when I went to a Neurologist and things got serious, she got quiet for like two days. That's all. I got my diagnosis via phone and immediately went out to my dad's, because I knew he'd understand better (even though my stepmother is a bit of an Nstepmom, but more on that in another post) and he did. The next day I met my mom and grandma for lunch, and my grandma (who had just finished Chemo for breast cancer) was attentive, asked questions, offered help, the whole deal. My mom, on the other hand, never even asked how I was feeling. She listened, idly, as if it were small talk she wasn't interested in. She then spent an hour drawing a diagram of her new office, complaining about how she told her boss she didn't like the setup because she felt 'clustered' (which, duh, she slacks off at work constantly and hardly works, so she doesn't want to get caught doing it) , etc. She literally spent the rest of lunch talking about anything but my scary, life-changing diagnosis. At the end, she left early because she said she had a headache. 

I ignored it, I'm used to it. My grandma talked me down from the near-boiling rage (I'm used to it, I shouldn't have gotten angry, but that's a pretty big thing to ignore like that) and told me that was just how she was, she'd come around, etc. She sort of did - every month or two she'll ask how I'm feeling, but she does the same thing - turns the conversation back to her and her problems. Oh darn, she went to court with my dad and now he has to pay her more money. It was such a pain to go to court. Blah. 

She's... different now. I won't say better. Her boyfriend being so laid back (and usually not putting up with her shit - if  she gets crazy he just goes into the back house and plays guitar until she calms down) has been really good for her, I think. To date, the only serious acknowledgement she's had of my condition came four months ago. A family friend developed a spinal infection, she's in a coma. My mom went to see her in the hospital (yet didn't come to see her own daughter) and when I went over for dinner a week or two later, she burst into tears talking about how it really hit home for her because she saw what spinal issues can be like. She's never brought it up again.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Disabled Ex-Disneyland CM taking a first WDW trip with boyfriend and his family. Help? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-09 12:26:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've had an AP for DL for years. Pretty much since I was a kid. I'm 23 now, my guy and I have been together two and a half years (actually, it'll be almost exactly two and a half years when we go) and we're going to Florida for a week at the end of May. Though we'll be staying in a house a few miles from WDW for the entirety of the trip, we may only be going to the parks for three days or so. I'd go every day, but we have things we'd be obligated to do with the family. 

SO. As someone who has been to DL and DCA literally at least four  hundred times in my life, what should I absolutely not miss at WDW? We'll be upgrading our Premium passes to Premier passes, so we'll have access to all the parks and we'll have a decent dining discount. I want to try to do at least one nice-ish dinner between the two of us, but I've read that reservations for a lot of places book up six months in advance, and since we're there in a month and a half, we don't really have that kind of time. 

What attractions are similar/the same as DL? What is close enough that we should skip? Which ones are different enough/interesting enough to warrant a visit? We'll probably do a day at Epcot, at least one Day at MK, and I want to do an afternoon or something at one of the other parks. Not sure which one is worth it! 

Since we'll likely be going throughout the week, I've read to end at MK, but I want to start there, even if it's just a half day there and then a half day at somewhere like HS or AK. Tips? 

And finally, FOOD. DL has hit and miss food everywhere you go - a killer flatbread here, a disgustingly dry meat stick there. Good turkey legs everywhere, but coffee that can be great or awful depending on where it comes from. Any places to avoid? Any places to absolutely not miss? 

Finally, because we're young and will want to have a little fun, a beer or two and a drink or two will probably be in order. Where are the best places for a fun drink or beer (preferably in park) that doesn't require sitting down and waiting forever? For example, at DCA I can get the same beer for the same price at Cove Bar and Bayside Brews, but Cove Bar can be a half-hour wait for a seat and then twenty minutes for a beer, where Bayside Brews has never taken longer than five minutes. Alternatively, the other beer stand not far from Bayside Brews often has horrendously long lines. 

So, general tips? A guide? I've read most of the online guides, but many of them seem to be dated or focus solely on family trips - while this is with family, I have no doubt that some of them will want to split off for periods of time, since the only kids under 18 are all under 3 and can do smaller rides while we do bigger stuff. 

This has been a marathon of a post, sorry, just eager to get better details so I can cement a plan in before we go. CM experience requires knowledge of a park so I don't absolutely drown in bad crowds or not great food. 

Also, I'm disabled - it wouldn't be clearly visible to the naked eye, but I have a spinal condition that prevents me from walking for more than twenty minutes without taking a break. I'm in a lot of pain throughout the day. I'm not sure if you guys updated your GWD routine, but the removal of the GAC passes has been hit or miss for us. What kind of system do you guys have over there? How many of the attractions, roughly, are accessible? I might rent a wheelchair, since I know I'm expecting pain as usual and I want to be able to have fun and not waste everyone's time. What do they cost, over there, and will they hassle me? I have a placard and some other information, but with DL it's hit and miss - some of them give you attitude unless you're really visibly impaired, which sucks and makes me feel worse. On a side note, I just got cleared to ride roller coasters again. I used to not even like them, but a year without them (pressure could have made it worse, we're at a point where we've figured out it won't, it'll just give me a little more pain) made me MISS THEM. I want to go on at least one big, crazy ride that I can only find at WDW or that is like DL, but different. 

I guess that's all! (I say as if it were short...)  </TEXT>

<TITLE> "Outings" on camping trips. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been camping literally since I was a few weeks old, I've done all sorts of camping from extremely primitive backpacking (with a less-than full pack, only slightly on purpose) to RV camping and cabins (which I hardly consider camping at all - just my opinion!). I'm going to Hearst/San Simeon this weekend on the California coast, for those that don't know, it's about two miles from Hearst Castle. Beautiful site right near the beach, with a lovely little town to walk through and a great campsite, from what I remember from last time. 

Some people argue that camping should just take place within walking distance from your site - be it lake, hiking, whatever. Many also say that a short drive for hiking, lake, "typical" camping things is acceptable. But I've had people get outright uppity about going to other sorts of places whilst camping. I was planning on taking my boyfriend to Hearst Castle for a tour/walk around the groups while we were there, and maybe a winery one afternoon. I had someone ask me, "why bother camping?" 

Anyone else have opinions on this? Personally, camping is a method of lodging and an activity for me - I like the cooking, the relaxing, the unusual little cities and towns. I love trees. But does leaving for part of the day make it any less like 'camping' for you?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Eyeshadow probs. Everything ends up too "soft" looking for me. </TITLE>

<TEXT> I don't know what it is. I see similar looks with products I already own, I put them on my face... and everything just looks so much less... awesome. I'll admit that I usually don't use eye primer, but staying power isn't the problem, really, it's how the pigments are showing up/shaped as soon as I put them on. 

Here's my usual (eye) routine:

Moisturizer goes on all over my face, including eyes. 
Same with foundation. 
I do my brows, which I'm just starting to learn how to do.
I use some kind of "all over" color. For a while I was using a really pretty metallic taupe Sephora brand shadow. I'm not a big fan of matte shadows. 
Highlight - Moon Beam/light pink or white eyeshadow on top. 
Any combination of shadows from MAC, Urban Decay (Naked 2 Palette) and a few other palettes. Lately it's been something like YDK in the crease, the same highlighter from under my brow bone on the inner corners, and Blackout on the outer third of my lid. My lids are a little bit hooded, but not much, and I have high brow bones so there's plenty of lid above the crease. 

I'm pale as all get out, so colors SHOULD show up a little brighter/darker on me. But instead, everything just looks really... soft. I have tried changing up which brushes I use, but it doesn't seem to do much difference. Even if my makeup looks "dark" to my while I put it on, two minutes later I look in the mirror and it looks much less intense. I can't get an outer V darker shadow to save my life, it just sort of looks like it fades out entirely. I've started going from brown on the outer edges, to dark dark purple, and now to black, and still, it seems like my looks are all very natural. 

Maybe I'm just approaching this the wrong way? I'm not really sure. I don't like my makeup super dramatic or anything, but I can't get things to look defined or even close to that. It just all looks like I blended it over and over again so that certain spots are just vaguely lighter or darker than the rest of the lids. Maybe I'm not picking up enough shadow? Or maybe I just need to layer the shadow a little heavier once it's on? That makes a little more sense, since my base color can be pretty shimmery, so maybe the darker shadows aren't taking shape like they should because they blend too easily with the smooth shimmer shadow? Ugh. 

Heeeeeeelp  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Any MLs present? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-02 09:59:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been participating for eight years now (oh my god) and have won each time. I finally stepped up to become an ML last year (and basically was given an area 3x bigger/more populated than I expected, in a weird turn of events) and WOW. It's an experience, to say the least... some very good times, and some very very bad times. Wondering who else might have ML'd before, or who plans on doing it next year, to chat ML-dom and the perks and pitfalls. And also to wonder if any of you have had "issues" with another ML, as I got dragged into something this last year that made me want to quit the program altogether. 

If you have any questions, feel free to ask!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Catching up all at once - my foray into two week's worth of intense feels (and my nightly sobfest when I realize I don't have the art skills I want) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-31 23:11:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A little history: I have no art history. None. I doodle in paper margins but I have no decent skill. I can't draw. The most artsy I get is designing a business card here and there, not including the logos that other, artsier people before me have designed. (Okay, I shouldn't say I have NO skill. I used to paint mugs for money. I wasn't great, but I wasn't the worst in the market, either. I just have trouble with painting things like PEOPLE.) 

About two (maybe three?) months ago I decided I needed to catch up on "that weird Night Vale thing" that I saw so, so many tumblr posts about. I did. Because I was on new pain meds, I was pretty loopy but also wide awake for entire nights. I would listen to three, four, five, or six episodes a night. I got caught up fairly quickly, and now waiting is TORTURE. It's like with any good TV show or anything - catching up is the best and worst thing you can do. 

However, the problem is that I have SO MANY IDEAS or I see so much inspiration for things I want to do. I just don't have the skills to even attempt these things. Someone posted on here about a Tarot deck, and I want to paint them so badly it hurts. Minor arcana and all. But I'm like "lol if I tried to paint people or anything that mattered, it would be a joke." 

My latest foray into trying to get all of my ideas of these people and places out, is creating them all via Sims. That's all I've got. I've seen some beautiful fan art. I'll make attempts to paint some WTNV things, but we'll see how that turns out. Meh.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> I'm chronically ill and struggling, hard. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-02-17 12:18:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I had been having strange, short-but-intensely-painful headaches for well over two years. I had no insurance. When I finally got covered again, I went into the ER with a splitting headache. Got a Neurologist referral, got MRIs done, got a diagnosis. I have a condition called Syringomyelia. Basically, it means that I have a fluid-filled cyst in my spinal cord (where fluid isn't supposed to go) and it creates a lot of pressure on all of those delicate nerves in my spine. It also interrupts cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow and that makes nasty things happen, to be short. Symptoms range from numbness and tingling, to muscle weakness and wasting, to headaches, chronic fatigue, etc. My entire list of symptoms, headaches, pains, numbness, tingling, nerve issues, etc, is much too long to type in here right now because if I did that my hand not literally would fall off and that's something I'm trying to prevent. There isn't any real "treatment" except for spinal surgery, and not everybody is a surgical candidate because it's a risky procedure, so even if you're getting worse, if you're not on the brink of paralysis or total life destruction (which is relative, of course) you probably won't get surgery. I probably won't. This could lead to paralysis, and because my condition is so under-researched, little is known about the progression. I could be just how I am for the rest of my life. I could wake up tomorrow completely paralyzed. It's a coin toss. 

Up until a few weeks ago, I was coping with this fairly well. My left arm has continued to get worse, but I was doing what I could. I finally got in to see my Neurologist again, and... bad news. 

Based on my symptoms (mostly debilitating nerve pain that shoots from my hips down to my ankles and feels like electric shocks to the bone, pulsating, for hours... gg legs), she thinks that there's at least one more syrinx somewhere lower in my spine. That, in my condition, is the equivalent of hearing that your first tumor is growing, and you also probably have a second one. I was prepared for something like this - we'd talked about it before and the idea then was to carefully monitor my symptoms and see what happened. Since the identifying symptoms got worse, she thinks there is probably another one. Joy. I was just getting the hang of one. Still, this isn't terribly bad news, it's a fairly common thing with this illness. The syrinx we DO know about for sure spans a little more than 5 vertebrae, and is about 3mm wide at the widest. That seems so tiny when you just see that, but remember that your spinal cord is about as big around as your pinky, and then you see that 3mm is kind of a lot of space. 

No, but then it got worse. My pain is not typical for my condition. Though many people with Syringomyelia do experience nerve pain in some cases, the TYPE of nerve pain I'm having is abnormal. I had an EMG done (basically they jab your nerves with needles and the results come out in waveforms that read out how well your nerves respond to electrical impulses. Hurts like a bitch. 0/10 do not recommend.) and my EMG results were abnormal, as well. My left side has responsiveness that is decreased by at least 60% on most tests. That explains the numbness and tingling, and also the weakness. It has gotten worse, though, in the two months since I've taken that test, so those results aren't so dependable. Now, though, we're doing a huge round of testing for a secondary condition. She's got a few ideas, all of them sound terrifying to me, and she said that while testing is normally for just ruling things out, it's highly likely that I have something and that I should prepare myself for changes. A few words were thrown around: Lupus, Fibromyalgia, Autoimmune Disorders, Rheumatoid Arthritis, to things like Degenerative Nerve Diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, spinal muscular atrophy). I'm reeling. It has only been six months since my first diagnosis and I'm having trouble accepting that another could be on the way and that my life will change even more. 

On top of all this is a bout of depression the likes of which I have never experienced. They say it's normal to mourn the loss of the future you had planned for yourself, and they're right. I've spent so much time saying goodbye to all of the things I wanted to do that I am no longer able to do. Hell, most days I'm barely awake for 12 or 14 hours, and during those hours I'm in pain. I am legally disabled. And that's about to get worse! But the reactions from my friends and family have not been helpful. 

About half of the time, people ask how I'm doing and listen and ask questions where needed. This is good, 10/10. 

Other times I've heard things like this: 

"I thought you were just lazy." 
"At least it's not Cancer!" 
"You can't be in that much pain." 
"You're too young to be that sick." 
(In response to Depression issues) "Just snap out of it."/"Just feel better." 
"I know what you're going through." (From totally healthy persons with one sick relative who assume they know everything about illness) 
"Are they sure it's ___________?" 
"Get a second opinion! You could be perfectly healthy!" 
(In response to my fears about disability/muscle wasting/paralysis) "Don't say that! That's not going to happen to you!" 
"You just need to stay positive and you'll be fine!" 

Stuff like this comes from my best friends. My parents. My step parents. My sister, my roommate, my boyfriend, everyone. One of my boyfriends friends had the nerve to tell me I "posted too much depressing stuff about being ill". Uh. Excuse me? Trust me, I get that staying positive is good. But stacking depression on top of a fairly new chronic illness and possibly another one is HARD. This is something that is changing the course of my life. (I'm writing this now at 3:00am because I'm in too much pain to sleep, the pain medication I have has been causing anxiety attacks so I'm not taking it, and my left arm is numb/dead/tingly, and trying to sleep on either side with that is laughable). This is something that threatens the very idea of simple things I have wanted in my life: walking down the aisle at my wedding, chasing my children around, swimming in the ocean, camping, everything. It's terrifying. The only person who 100% can sympathize with me is my grandmother, who just went into remission (discovered Breast Cancer at late stage 2B, closer to 3. Close save.) and my friend who has a nerve disorder, but hers is vastly different and we don't pretend to know what the other is going through. I just don't understand the lack of support from the people around me. Everyone was *so* supportive at first - texting, calling, offering to drive me to appointments, offering to bring me food. I turned it all down, I wasn't so bad then. But now that I actually need help, it's like I'm talking to a brick wall. On good days, I can get up and straighten up the house for an hour or so, then I'm tired and need a nap. On bad days, I can't get downstairs to eat. My boyfriend, who I live with, is starting to get it, but that's complicated - he was raised in a house that very much reinforced the stigmas surrounding mental health, his mother has the opinion that people with mental health issues shouldn't be allowed to own guns or have children, that sort of thing - and even then, it's like he forgets. It's pretty hard to get when I know I'm constantly complaining. He's normally pretty supportive, and I can understand he's frustrated, but since he can't see it through my eyes, he can't understand that when I say I'll run an errand or two the next day, sometimes I just can't get through getting dressed, driving 20-30 minutes to wherever I need to go, walking around a store, waiting in line, driving home, etc. That can total hours of activity that most people take for granted. I went grocery shopping a little over a month ago, and I tried carrying a basket. Laughable. It took me a week to recover. Of our two roommates, one is pretty supportive but doesn't talk much, so I know when I need to vent I can, but I don't like to burden him. The other one... he will listen, doesn't know how to respond, and then finds things that I like and tells me about them (ie I just discovered the WritingPrompts subreddit and I could cry I'm so happy) and like he just makes me laugh, which helps so much when it's clear that I'm just feeling like shit and that's what I need. 

I guess I'm just really finding out who is "there" for me and who isn't. But it's not helping that so many people offered support, and when it comes down to it there's really only a small handful of people I can count on, and even those people are... tricky. I looked for a support group in my area for people with my condition, but I can't find much. The one I found online is alright, but it's not the same. About two years ago I went through this big purge of people that were toxic in my life, it was hard but ultimately beneficial. I'm sad to find out that if I did something like that this time - cut out everyone who wasn't supportive or at least nice about it - I would have no one left. 

TL;DR I'm chronically ill and possibly have another condition and people suck. 

I'd like to say I'm just venting but I'm perfectly open for discussion and questions. Talking it out helps me, I think, and since I can't talk much about it with the people at home, I'm hoping people here will be better.  </TEXT>
