<TEXT> I don't really worry too much and don't have anything to worry about. I have a job (filing paperwork) where I am waiting anxiously to see the outcome of things I did like 2-3 months ago. I am pretty much always in the mood "WOW, really? who knows what's gonna happen next". </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, we discussed beta blockers (nebivolol in my case) because of my high BP and heart rate, but we will only try this if xanax doesnt solve the problem directly from the brain.

The reason I visited a doctor at all was high blood pressure that made me feel like I will have a heart attack. (140/100)

Thank you so much for your answers. Makes me feel better that you can guess so accurately like this is a common issue. I left my doctor having some doubts she knows what she is doing while I am having some rare weird condition. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah it was the GP. We spent an hour or so discussing it. In the end I got xanax, which seems to "cure" both anxiety and depression anyway though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I started waking up 5 hours into sleep and then falling back into lucid dreaming intentionally. Works like a charm, however something strange happens.

As I fall asleep trying to stay aware that this is a dream I can feel my body transitioning into sleep state - almost fainting. My hands and legs feel like they have no more blood flowing.

On the other hand when I am waking up I can feel my heart racing and my body being very warm, sometimes sweating a little bit.

I am curious if this is normal and known to be safe?

Also is it strange that in my dreams there is always a hand holding me from behind?

Thanks a lot for any answers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ... +100. I am amazed how romantic and clueless most people are. Unless you are piss-addicted to something you have no idea what pleasure feels like.

Also I think there is something like a dynamic range in the sense of pleasure. Once you cross the the limit the range expands and only then you can compare to ordinary natural sources of pleasure. Same when transitioning from real bad to real good feelings. </TEXT>
