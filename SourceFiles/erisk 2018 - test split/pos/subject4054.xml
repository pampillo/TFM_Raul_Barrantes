<TEXT> Hi there.  As someone who just received a dual diagnosis   has put her marriage in jeopardy many times because of drug abuse while manic, I'm going to go out on a limb   say tell your GF the whole story, once you figure out if you have an STD.

You say she suffers from depression; you may be surprised by her reaction, maybe she can identify with what you're both going through.

Just try to hold on until you have all the facts, ok?  I know waiting is the worst part.  Believe me.  Almost all my ideation happens when I am waiting for the consequence of something I did or thought I did. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this is a great conversation.  I'm prob about 20 years older than most of users on the makeup subs in general.  I grew up in the grunge/punk scene (nary a festival in sight thank god) and cultural appropriation just wasn't a thing.  We were all sort of androgynous as far as fashion   makeup went.  So I have seen so many trends come and go.  And I've worked in the fashion industry for a long time (Urban's Kent State sweatshirt debacle anyone?  I had to gather a bunch of mid 20 somethings around to tell them WHY is was offensive.  Fun convo!)

My point is, I do understand cultural appropriation but my friend group (Gen X, the forgotten ones) could give a shit about girls wearing bindis to Coachella.  And yes they are practicing Hindus.

TLDR

My youngin's just keep reading and be open.  Educate yourselves.  The boomers   the millennials are so entrenched in their viewpoints.  Common sense goes a long way.

Signed,

Makeup Crone

<TEXT> Hi there!  I had a really similar experience my freshman year of college.  I was isolated in a dorm, and for some reason every single girl hated me, took every chance they could to bully   harass me.  It got to the point where I was afraid to leave my room to go to the bathroom.

I spent endless hours on the phone with my parents   boyfriend.

I attempted suicide for the first time in my life that 1st semester.

If I could go back in time and give myself advice, I should have dropped out completely and sought psychological help.

Instead, I pushed through that first year (I did manage to switch dorms) and ultimately transferred to a new university much closer to home.

Is transferring an option for you or maybe taking a year off? </TEXT>

The kid thing...every time I start feeling better about not having a family, somebody always asks me why I don't have one, why don't I adopt, why don't I go to the doctor.

I don't know if you watch House of Cards, but the female lead is constantly barraged by questions like this.  Her stock response: Do you ever regret having them?  I'm at the point where I want to say that to people who are rude enough to ask.

<TITLE> I'm turning 40 this weekend, and honestly I didn't know if life is living anymore </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-23 03:14:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> At age 40, I've accomplished nothing.  I'm infertile, have had multiple miscarriages.  Children were the one thing I've always wanted.  My husband is not supportive of assisted reproductive procedures or adoption.  Case closed.  I also no longer have a sex life.  My husband is a good friend and provider, but we're not really in a marriage.

I used to have a career until I cracked up over the 80 hour week.  Now I just have a job that pays the bills. 

At age 30, I was carjacked, robbed and raped.  My family still refuses to talk about it.  I've moved on the best I can, and time has helped.

A few years later, there was a serial rapist that matched my perps MO and description.  After a few drinks, I went looking for him.  No property was damaged and no one was hurt, but I paid my debt to society.  Believe me, I wanted to be punished. Family was predictably not supportive (which I understand, I broke the law.). But it was a difficult time for me to say the least.

My husband decided to throw a surprise party for me this Friday.  None of my blood relatives are attending.  We don't live that far away, but yet my mother told my husband via text that she felt "I was pulling away and they couldn't come because my dad is tired."  They also refused to watch my brother's kids, so my brother and sister in law are not coming.  Never mind the fact that I am constantly running up there for all their parties and created an education trust so that my nephew will have options when he turns 18.  I gave him my old car when they got "accidentally" pregnant with their second child.

This is long, but I'm at the end of my rope. I've been actively suicidal before, and I feel it creeping up on me again.  I've been through 10 therapists through no fault of my own, they're always changing practices.  My p-doc diagnosis of me is major depression and anxiety.  I disagree.  I believe I may have bi-polar, possibly borderline, and for sure PTSD.

All of this is just to say, what's the point?  No kids, job I hate, family who is only interested in what they can get out of me and this pseudo-marriage.  

ETA:  Wow!  So many responses!  Thank you everyone, I'll try to get to all of them today (despite crappy job :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you so much for your reply.  Yes, I actually started my own survivor group but then it morphed into something else.  We have a group in my city call WOAR (Women Against Rape) but all the groups meet during business hour and my industry is not very forgiving when it comes to mid day appointments like that. </TEXT>
