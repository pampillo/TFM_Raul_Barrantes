<TEXT> I feel like you're trying way too hard too justify his outrage - which, like I said, may not even be genuine. He's kind of an asshole and likes to stir up shit on social media constantly. 

If you truly believe that a picture of a fully-clothed man with some text on it is degrading, I can't imagine how you can cope with the things that *actually* degrade people. 

I didn't post this to get into fights with strangers. I posted it because I wanted to vent about being harassed every time I walk down to the corner market and how incredibly clueless that guy was. Instead, I am told that I'm not allowed to complain about something and that I'm the problem in this scenario. 

I want to give you some sincere advice based on the conversation we've just had: you should never tell *any*one that they're not entitled to their own thoughts and feelings. It's horribly dismissive when the person you're talking to is coping with their anger or sadness in a healthy way, i.e. posting about it on a friendly internet board instead of screaming at their families. 

Have a lovely night.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> And I've posted a pic of Obama on her page that said "hey girl, you miss complete sentences?" Could that have been offensive, too? 

The meme is based on the fact that Canada has socialized medicine and that the House just passed a bill that would basically label being a woman a pre-existing condition while simultaneously stripping protection for those with pre-existing conditions. someone found a cute pic of a world leader whom I greatly admire and is known as being an attractive guy, and captioned it like a Ryan gosling meme. 

I simply commented on the pic with a joke. I make jokes like that about various people all the time on FB and irl. The guy was just trying to start shit. 

I really have a hard time seeing it as anything but trolling or straight-up overreaction. I've known the guy since I was 12; he's incredibly privileged and doesn't understand that. 

My point is this: if waxing poetic as part of a joke - wherein I did not say anything explicit or degrading about the subject - makes a big, well-off man feel "creeped out," then he needs to walk a mile in my shoes. Or the shoes off any other woman who's ever been harassed. Using flowery language to call a person dreamy is way less creepy than the shit I put up with on a weekly basis, and I'm 110% sure he would not have called a guy creepy if the pic Princess Madeleine of Sweden and he called her hot.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my defense, Trudeau is a very handsome man and feminist who is well-spoken, a great father,  and intelligent. He and young Joe Biden are my two political man-crushes, which I exaggerate to the extreme on social media because I think it's funny to be a crazy fangirl over politicians. It's a bit my mom and I do. 

She posted a photo of the PM saying, "hey girl, I'll cover your pre-existing conditions," then told me not to stare too long and go to work. I replied, "why would I do that? Do you look away from a desert sunset?" 

Being super corny is a hobby of mine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My first boyfriend coerced me into trying anal even though I, personally (not trying to kink-shame anytime, this is just my own sexual reality) never found it appealing. He had a rather large member and I knew it would hurt. 

It did. When it was over, I felt emotionally and physically violated and exhausted. I cried. He guilted me for crying because it "made him feel like a rapist." Well, guess what, dude, it made me feel like a rape victim. I told him I'd never do it again. 

Then, a few months later, he decides we should try again. I didn't get a say, because by this point emotional abuse and sexual coercion had come to define the relationship. In order to keep him from manipulating my emotions, I let him do it. Same thing happened again, to no one's surprise but his. 

That repeated every couple of months for the duration of the 3 years we were together. We eventually broke up and I had a 2-year period of voluntary celibacy before I started seeing my second boyfriend. 

He wanted to do anal, said I didn't like it because I had never done it right.  I put my foot down because I knew without a doubt that I would never enjoy it. He pressured me and I relented, because I still hadn't realized that coerced sex was not consentual. He was the first guy to earn my trust since that shit of an abusive ex, and we broke up very soon after he did this for unrelated reasons.

I'm celibate again. I've grown enough in the last few years to come to the conclusion that my sexual boundaries are law from now on, and anyone who disrespects that will bring kicked out of my life dick first. 

Sorry to bother you with my anal life story, it was half venting and half me trying to tell you that you have a right to say no to absolutely *anything* involving your body and mind, and that  no one gets to shame you for having preferences. 

I'm positive you already knew all that, but I want to reassure all women that they are their own masters. I didn't understand that until way too late.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A condition is only considered a disorder if it causes stress, emotional discomfort, or other mental anguish, and only if the pain is *not* inflicted by societal expectations and differing from social norms. 

So at its most basic level, gender dysphoria is the mental stress of not belonging in one's own body. 

Transgenderism is simply another state of being, which is separated from dysphoria. Being trans would not be mentally painful were it not for society's alienation and stigmatization, so it is not a disorder.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Dems need to quit running policy wonks (Al Gore, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton) that talk at people rather than too people.

I'm going to have to disagree. While the charisma aspect of running for office is important, Gore, Kerry, and Hillary were all among the best of the best in regarding legislative know-how. I think we'd be doing ourselves a massive disservice by passing on the best minds in the arena in favor of personableness. 

My point is this: we should always vote for the most qualified, prepared candidate whose views match ours best. The fact that Americans don't is, imo, a result of poor education and rampant anti-intellectualism, both of which Democrats want to fix. 

The Dems have a tendency to come across as caring more about identity politics and globalization rather than things like the opiod epidemic, rural poverty, etc. 

The opiod epidemic and rural poverty *are* identity politics, though. They just don't happen to be one of the identities upon which Democrats generally focus. We've definitely got to work on that, I couldn't agree more. However, pretending that Dems haven't tried to address these issues is ridiculous. Dems want to improve education in rural communities and create jobs in clean energy, which would alleviate much of the poverty in rural areas, and expand healthcare, which would help addicts get the help they need and recover.  </TEXT>

Is it awful that our operatives have tampered with elections in sovereign nations? Absolutely. But what are we supposed to do about it? Whataboutism is not going to stop the propaganda operation that is *currently in progress* and is targeting one (more likely two, I'm sure the Kremlin is working against Merkel as well) of our most important allies. It needs to be stopped *now*, and bringing up America's transgressions only serves to dismiss Russia's active measures. Bringing this stuff up is quite literally a Russian propaganda technique, and it has been since the Cold War.  </TEXT>

She's still got the dress, but I look ridiculous in it. She gave me permission to cut it all up and use the fabric (it's about 50 pounds of pristine snow-white satin) in my own custom dress. :) [It looked fantastic on her,](http://i.imgur.com/ylWAoUu.jpg) but she's about 8" taller than I am and our builds could hardly be more different.

<TEXT> Same here. Although one thing that stuck with me was the time my best friend (now deceased) and I were changing into our PJs for a sleepover and she saw me topless. I was super shy and got embarrassed, but then she said, "dude, don't be. You've got great nipples." Then she went into a little rant about her own nipples being too dark and blah blah blah. 

It was strange and kinda awkward, but hearing that from a girl who I thought was crazy gorgeous has made me hate my breasts a little less.

Trust me, if you're being crushed under a man who's got a solid 150lbs of muscle on you and is capable of holding you down anyway while he repeatedly impales your chafing, non-consenting flesh with an unlubricated penis, you fear for your fucking life. 

Never mind that some victims are assaulted at gun- or knifepoint. 

Of course they're different situations. They're different situations *by definition.* Being mugged and beaten up can be incredibly traumatic. While I've never been mugged, I've been violently raped. I got the beating, the threats, **and** had I had to lie in a puddle of my own tears and spit for God-knows-how-long because my body was no longer my own. 

This happened nearly two years ago now, and the one time since then I trusted anyone enough to give sex a shot, it triggered a severe panic attack. 

But, yeah, totally the same as a mugging. Ugh. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Des Moines is one of my favorite cities. My grandparents have a house in West Des Moines, which is admittedly the nicer section, that they are renting to my aunt. If I'd lived there, I'd have gone to high school with Shawn Johnson, the Olympic gymnast, and been able to train with her coach. But, c'est la vie. 

The people are so nice and very liberal in the city. Visiting my aunt and uncle in Sioux City, King's district, is like traveling to a dimension full of shittier people. 

Iowa City, Ames, Indianola, and Des Moines, basically any city with a university, are awesome and progressive. What little towns there are that're still thriving are kinda backwards, but the people are nice in that Midwest way, which I love.

<TEXT> No problem. It's an issue that bothers me greatly, as no one seems to pay attention to it, so I'm glad that I've spread the word at all.  

Livestock, especially ruminants such as cattle, producemethane (CH4)as part of their normal digestive processes. This process is called enteric fermentation, and it represents almost one third of the emissions from the Agriculture economic sector.


The way in which manure from livestock is managed also contributes to CH4and N2O emissions. Different manure treatment andstorage methods affect how much of these greenhouse gases are produced. Manure management accounts for about 15 percentof the total greenhouse gas emissions from the Agriculture economic sector in the United States.

<TEXT> Las Cruces is nice. It's gonna be hot as hell compared to Des Moines in the summer, but it'll be a dry heat which is *way* more bearable (until it gets over 120, then you create your own humidity). Monsoon season sucks, though. Bright side, compared to what you're used to, the winters will be a breeze.

As far as culture goes, it'll be different. But wonderful. The food is amazing (I moved away from my border town home and haven't found good Mexican food since, which is a serious problem) and my best friend's parents treat me like their own, even though neither of them are fluent in English. To generalize grossly from my personal experience, border communities are closely knit and deeply loving. Make sure you participate in whatever festivals take place and just be friendly. Shouldn't be a problem for an Iowan. 

I don't know about Las Cruces, but my hometown had a bit of a gang problem. The wall by my house gets tagged pretty often, I have distinct memories of a couple drive-bys in my childhood and my high school was the site of some gruesome fights. That's something you may want to check up on, but it can easily be avoided if you're in the right neighborhood. My house was very much *not*. 

Last thing, the sunrises and sunsets in this part of the country are like nothing else in this world. We've got so much horizon that the sun sets the sky on fire. It's one of my favorite things about where I grew up. If you do end up moving out west, you'll see what I mean. 

That's all I can think of, really. Is there anything specific you had questions about? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Black American culture is a thing. When Africans were taken as slaves, they lost their cultural identity and created a new one in America. Most black Americans can't tell you where their families came from - not with any certainty, anyway. Slave traders took their culture from them by force, their "owners" forbade celebration of their culture, and so they made a new one. That's a big part of what Black Pride is about in the States.

Meanwhile, I'm white and I can tell you which of my ancestors came from where and a lot of my ancestral heritage is still a part of family tradition. 

There is not a "white culture" in the States outside of certain, historically isolated or oppressed groups, in the same way that there is in the black community. Black pride and white pride are totally different animals for that, among many other reasons.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yup. My parents are Midwestern, I was born in the Desert Southwest. I was raised in a community of Mexican immigrants (my best friend's parents were undocumented until 10 years ago), and being white, I was part of a tiny minority (like, maybe 15% of the population). I'm grateful for my upbringing because I think it made me a much more empathetic person and it certainly made me more aware of how differently I am treated by authority figures. The contrast between police and teachers' attitudes towards me and my nonwhite friends was stark, and I never went through the "white people are oppressed!" phase like some of my cousins back east did. 

I'm in college now, and I love it. Meeting people of different backgrounds is one of my favorite things to do. I agree, it seems impossible that someone could go to uni and not come out more open-minded and liberal.  </TEXT>

However, dismissing the plurality of Trump voters who just need some  and perspective as white supremacists is counterproductive. Accusing them of white supremacism will only serve to alienate those who have the capacity and humility to admit that they've been wrong and want to better themselves. 

As for the bona fide white supremacists, fascists, and assorted bigots, yeah, they're definitely a thing. They may be beyond help. Even so, the more the left mobilizes and educates, the more non-deplorables we can swing over to our side.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mom's best friend in college had three abortions in the four years she was getting her degree. This was in the 80's, when it was still fairly accessable. All three times, my mom made the phone calls to the clinic and helped her through the process, and after each one, the friend's mother told her "we do not speak of this. If you must talk about it at all, you miscarried." All three pregnancies were with the same man, whom she eventually married and had kids with. 

That friend is now as anti-choice as it gets. Both of her sons had kids in high school, and frankly, they shouldn't have. Her daughter "miscarried" at 14, or that's the story they tell. I firmly believe she had an abortion and they're using the family line to avoid blatant hypocrisy. It's fucking reprehensible. </TEXT>

I fundraised for her campaign a couple of times, and I met her once last year. She seems like a great person and she was very gracious to our organizers. Plus, I agreed with her on basically every issue I've heard her speak about. 

If it's Sinema, that's fine by me. I think she's a good candidate, too. Frankly, I'd vote for a toaster oven if it meant Flake were gone. He's awful.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, the SK President was impeached on March 10 due to corruption charges (the whole scandal is a crazy web of bribery and abuse of power, and also a blacklist of ~10,000 leftists who criticized the President. I highly recommend everyone look it up because it's interesting to say the very least), and a new president will be elected on May 9. 

The acting President is an old-school conservative, meaning he is extremely focused on national security and hard on NK.  As a prosecutor, he fixated on the National Security Law, a broad Cold War-era ban on engaging with anyone from or speaking positively of NK/communism. 

He is *not* running for the presidency, and both of the two frontrunners are to the left of him, and both believe in opening up relations to the north. 

As far as I can tell, the only way SK will back the US is if the hawks in DC can convince the acting President to go in, like, immediately.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> That inching towards the center started in 1972. 

In '72, George McGovern was the Democratic nominee facing Nixon. McGovern promised immediate withdrawal from Vietnam, amnesty for draft dodgers, a 35+% decrease in defense spending, guaranteed minimum income for impoverished families, and supported the Equal Rights Amendment. He was an outsider who ran a massive grassroots campaign in the primaries.

He was a decorated WWII veteran who, after witnessing innocent civilians starve to death, became devoted to ending hunger worldwide. 

But, because he was a populist outsider and his platform was somewhat more radical in certain respects, he was smeared by Democratic party insiders (including Jimmy Carter) as "too liberal." He was branded an elitist despite his humble upbringing and plain manner of speaking. 

A right-wing pundit branded him the candidate  of "amnesty, abortion and acid," which probably would've *won* him votes if he ran in 2016. 

Meanwhile, Nixon was spying on the DNC and attacking McGovern ruthlessly, trying to paint him as a radical whose liberal values and pacifism would make the country weak. 

Side note: the Clintons led the McGovern campaign in Texas, and it could be argued that watching the smear campaign destroy a genuinely good candidate's campaign pushed them to remain publicly centrist. 

We need to embrace progressivism again. McGovern is one of the best presidents we never had.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> She really is. She's got pregnant with her first at 16 by a drunkard 8 years her senior, was forced to marry him, and ended up with 5 little boys before she was 25. The original pregnancy was not caused by a consensual encounter, but being a southern woman in the 50s, she didn't have much of a choice. He beat her and sometimes the boys whenever he drank, which was whenever he was home. She finally left him because of my youngest uncle. She got pregnant again and bio-gramps told her she could either give the baby away or he'd "beat it out of her." Grandma made adoption arrangements and cut off all contact with her family in order to keep it secret. 

He was a trucker and wasn't in the state when grandma went into labor. She called her sisters and that went to the hospital. Holding her new son, surrounded by her boys and family, she decided to leave her husband. She couldn't give up her baby. 

Her family packed up what little was hers and she moved in with one of her sisters. After she found a job waiting tables, she got a tiny rental home and kept them all fed for five years. Then she met my grandpa, who married her, took in five little boys (all under the age of 10), and raised them as his own. 

It's literally my favorite story. Between grandma overcoming her fear and circumstances and the beautiful love story aspect, I want to write it into a novel. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My grandma was born and raised in a picturesque little Iowa town. The kind of place where the main street is paved with bricks, just like pretty much all of the buildings on the square. Just about everyone who lived there was either an immigrant or first generation, and seven members of my extended family are buried there. The men in that town worked in the coal mine, and the community was vibrant. 

That is, until the coal dried up. That was 30 years ago, and the town is unrecognizable now. I never got to see it when it was a happy place, besides in old, grainy photos. Now, the main street's brickwork is crumbled and broken, all the shops are boarded, and my grandma's childhood home has collapsed due to neglect and the elements. 

A few houses are still occupied (Lord only knows why), and in the woods by the cemetery, someone's parked a rusted-out trailer, nailed a plywood "TRESPASERS WILL BE SHOT" (misspelling and all) sign to a tree, and hung the Stars and Bars off their siding (in Iowa. Ffs. Literally six Union soldiers/veterans are buried not 100 feet from it). 

My grandma was middle class. Her father was a miner and her mom was a schoolteacher. They saved every penny (she was born right before the markets crashed and the soil dried up), and lived like paupers so that their girls could go to college, because they valued the hell out of education. My grandma and her sisters left that town for bigger and better things, as did most of her neighbors. The few who still live there are the miners who didn't leave 30 years ago and their kids and grandkids. 

I don't feel bad for the people who decide to stay in a dying community when opportunity exists elsewhere. I have even less sympathy for that racist illiterate who makes me cringe every year when I visit the cemetery. 30 years ago, college was still affordable and the job market wasn't oversaturated and hypercompetitive like it is now. Hell, if they'd moved 75 miles in any direction, they could've gotten a job in one of the other billion coal mines in the area. 

Does it suck that a prosperous town withered away? Yes, absolutely. But that's life. There was no more coal, no more money coming into the community, and people left. That's what happens when a town is built around one single, finite economic resource.  People have to quit complaining and go find something else. That's what Americans are supposed to be best at.      </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> New Netflix show about a young girl who takes her own life  and what's left when she's gone  I don't know if I recommend it or not, really. It's well-done in that it's infuriating and heartbreaking and brought back all the worst feelings from the first few weeks after I lost my best friend ten months ago. It really hit home for me, and I almost couldn't get through it. 

It's one of those things where if you think you're up to it, maybe check it out. But it gets graphic and it's jarring at times. I think it's only something you should watch if you're willing to cry and hurt and maybe learn a little about where someone's head might've been when they did it. I'm also not sure how much of it is specific to young women who take their own lives, but it was very relevant to my experience and my friend's death.  

I don't know if this will be an even remotely helpful review or recommendation but those are my two cents.

Important edit: considering I spent the hour immediately after finishing the series sobbing uncontrollably, it may be more emotionally packed than I thought when I first wrote this. I still think it is a good, illuminating series, but I have to stress the "make sure you're ready" part of the post. I was not as ready as I thought.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your dad and my dad would get on like brothers. 

My dad is one of 5, born into a poor family in a poor town. He had to drop out of college because he wanted to make sure he sent money to host mother every month and couldn't afford both, so he enlisted in the Marines and became an advanced aircraft electrician. Then he worked at a military proving ground, but felt he had to quit when GWB invaded Iraq because he refused to contribute to the murder of Iraqi civilians. He owned an antique furniture refinishing business for awhile, but it closed when the markets crashed. So now he is an assistant manager at a home improvement store. 

He's got some nasty things to say about the state of Arizona's politics, never mind the clusterfuckery that's happening on the national stage. As for Jimmy Carter, he was the first president my dad ever voted for who won, and he still considers Carter to be the most criminally underrated president in recent US history. 

Meanwhile, I still learn new, amazing things he's said and done from my mom every once in awhile. He never talks about himself. 

I feel like our dads are cut from the same cloth.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Deniers must have lived blessed lives if they've never experienced something so horrible that their minds  protected them by shutting down all feeling or rational reaction. 

When my other closest friend called and told me that our sister was dead, my first thought (which, thankfully, I did not vocalize) was, "well, at least now we know for sure who my maid of honor will be someday." It's not rational to crack a joke immediately after being told horrific news, but my mind was protecting me from it. I was in shock immediately, and it was only hours later, as I was trying on pants in a department store dressing room, that the loss hit me. I lost all composure and cried violently for the first time that day. 

I'm so happy for deniers - they've never been hurt badly enough to know what it feels like (or, rather, *doesn't* feel like) to go into shock.    </TEXT>

My parents are both technically Boomers (very tail end of the Boomer timeline), and they're both incredibly progressive. It's hardly as if the subsequent generations are a wonderful group of generous empaths, and I speak from personal experience as a progressive millennial who grew up in a red state. 

I'll absolutely agree that some Boomers have made shitty choices and caused many a mess, but pitting generations against each other is hardly what we need to focus on right now.  </TEXT>

I maintain that the people who believe in false flag conspiracies, at their very core, are just incapable of believing that bad things happen to innocent people for no reason. They'd rather believe that the government is an entity of pure, conniving evil than accept that children were murdered in their classrooms. 

That level of innocence and optimism is almost sweet, until you see the damage these people do to the survivors and those who lost loved ones in tragedy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My best friend died this past summer, at a month shy of 21. It was completely unexpected - she was young and physically healthy. In the nearly ten years I'd known her, we had spent probably more than half of our weekends at either my parents' house or hers. Her parents were like a second family to me, and mine to her. 

When I got the call that she was gone, I saw my own father cry for the second time in my life - the first was when his dad passed- and my mother shut down emotionally. I myself felt detached from reality and more like an observer than a living person. It was like losing a sister. 

The funeral was worse. Her mother was more broken than I ever knew a person could be without dying. When I approached her in the pew, she stood and embraced me, sobbing, but could only hold herself up for a few seconds before collapsing into my arms in pain. She had just lost her youngest child, and there is no pain like that of losing your baby. 

Fuck Sandy Hook deniers. The experience of losing my best friend and sister and watching her family crumble into pieces as I tried to hold myself together only added to my anger at these people. It hardly helps that I come from a long family line of educators and myself work with elementary school kids, any of whom I'd take a clip of bullets for.  

I'm very sorry about your brother. I hope you're well.   </TEXT>

It's just another concept that has been twisted beyond recognition by right-wing propagandists as a means of demonizing the left.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every school in my hometown mandated abstinence-only sexual education. If a teacher were to talk about condoms, and a student told their parents, their parents could likely get the teacher fired. The switch to abstinence-only was precipitated by parental outrage at the concept of teenagers having teenaged hormones. 

Another fun fact: my home state has the 6th-highest rate of teen pregnancy in the country, and my hometown has the highest rate in the state. 

No way those are connected though, right? /s </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm in Arizona. Our government seems to think that, either education does not matter, or taking money away from the Dept. of Ed. will magically improve our rankings. Meanwhile, the turnover rate for teachers is unreasonably high, no one will fill the vacancies that open mid-year (so the rest of the teachers have to fill in for no extra pay, giving up their prep and lunch periods), and our teacher : student ratio makes classroom management and one-on-one time basically impossible. 

Not only is my mother's district in one of the worst ed. states, it's also in a poor county, and her school is in a poor part of town. She's been at that school for 20 years and has only held on these last few because doing so guarantees her a state pension. 

She is an excellent teacher (I was in her class, and she's adored by most of her students), and she loves her students. Helping kids learn is in our blood, but the shit Republican government and asshole district admin have nearly broken her spirit. It's awful. I'm not a certified teacher (I'm a SPED and general classroom aide while I'm at university), nor will I ever be, because I've seen how terribly teachers are treated in this country. I plan on going into politics and advocating for education reform so maybe we can build a better system. 

I am so sorry to hear that your wife is having such a hard time. I hope it gets better for her, and I hope she can keep going. Teaching is a hard goddamned job, and, to me, it's the most important job in the world. The fact that the people in charge of our children's futures are treated like their work doesn't matter boils my blood. 

Wish your wife the absolute best for me, and let her know that an internet stranger is rooting for her. :)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just watched her speech and the little Q A after it and I thought it was great. She gets a lot of flak for being "disingenuous," but I didn't doubt her genuineness there at all. It was a forum on women's issues, which she has always been passionate about, and she spoke from personal experience.

My perception of her sincerity might be influenced by my own experiences - considering I was born forty-some years later than her, much of our backgrounds and experiences are remarkably similar. I've been told since middle school that I can come across as fake or unnatural, even when I'm speaking openly. So it may just be a matter of perspective. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Only 200 thousand years of humans raising their own young have gotten us this far.  But sure, now, NOW is when we decide that no parents are capable to raising their own children.

Raising a child and knowing what's best for a child's education are two very, *very* different things. 


I know, we should set up a plutocracy, where only a few elites get to have a say on how children are raised.

That's not what OP said at all. 

First off, I'd hardly call educators "a few elites." 

Second, and I repeat myself, educating =/= raising. 

And third, is it plutocratic to entrust doctors with diagnosis and treatment of illness rather than, say, parents who have not studied medicine?

Where I grew up, you could enroll in any public school as long as you had transportation, but it didn't much matter because Arizona's education system is broke and teachers don't even bother applying because the state doesn't think competitive salaries are a worthwhile investment.

Tl;dr American education needs a complete overhaul pretty much everywhere. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Beautifully put. 

My dad is severely dyslexic, so when he started school, he struggled and had to repeat kindergarten. My grandma was a single mother supporting five kids on a waitress's earnings. She had no way to get him specialized help, nor did she have the tools to recognize his disability for what it was. The local school district was underfunded, so resources were basically nonexistent.

His second kindergarten teacher was the only reason my dad made it through school. She recognized the problem, offered her time and worked with him. If she hadn't noticed how hard he struggled, understood the cause, and found a way to make things better, I never would have been born. 

Meanwhile, my mother, grandmother, great-grandfather, great-great-grandmother, and at least ten members of my extended family have spent their lives teaching public school. My mother earned her master's degree while pregnant with me, for Christ's sake. I learned at an early age to respect and value education, and to trust my teachers until they give sound reason to doubt their judgement. I've only had to doubt two (one told my parents I was on drugs because my grades slipped - I'd been gone for two weeks because my grandpa was hospitalized and died in that time; the other blew me off when I explained that *Of Mice and Men* was named after a poem by Robert Burns and told the class it was"because Lennie liked mice" instead). 

Teachers are literally trained to know better than parents about the best educational options for students. I've heard many a story about parents who think they're smarter than teachers, and seriously, you don't want to be that parent. Not only do you make a fool of yourself, you do harm to your child's future.

Fuck Betsy DeVos. She knows nothing about education.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can confirm. The stories my mother has told about some of her students' parents are infuriating. 

Parents are irrational, protective, and emotional where their kids are involved. They routinely make decisions based on nothing but their gut, and they blame everyone but their child for any issue involving education. 

Of course, there are some reasonable, realistic parents who understand that their children are not perfect and make decisions based on logic, but their children are rarely as entitled or poorly-behaved, so teachers don't often get to deal with them.

<TEXT> It's also the candidate's job to make that platform known. She talked about actual policy less than any presidential candidate ever. 

Can you please source that? Because she talked about policy all the time, but was ignored by the media.


And that gave off the ruse that either she was bullshitting about her progressive platform or she considered the voters too stupid to understand it. 

Her platform was literally the most progressive in history, and her policy proposals were available to the public at all times. The problem wasn't that she underestimated the people's intelligence, it was that she overestimated how much they cared about facts and policy. 


THEN WHY WOULD YOU THINK SHE WOULD WIN? 

Maybe because she was highly qualified and accomplished in her own right? Once again, the Democrats had too much faith in the media and public  to vote with their brains, rather than vote based on who was more entertaining.  </TEXT>

Ugh. I'm the fifth generation of educators in my family, and my grandparents would be absolutely flabbergasted at the current state of public education, not to mention what apparently lies ahead. My mother has been teaching in one of the bottom 5 states in education for nearly three decades. She's got a master's degree and 27 years of experience, yet she hasn't gotten a raise in nearly ten. Her benefits, planning time, and supply stipend have been chipped away to near nonexistence, and she's watched helplessly as standardized testing performance quotas have demoralized students and stifled what little funding her district was given. 

She told me, a few years back, "I don't know if it can get any worse than it is now." Little did she fucking know. Ffs.   </TEXT>

A certain amount of personal responsibility, i.e. fact-checking and understanding candidate platforms, that is expected of the voters, and rightfully so. It's not Hillary's fault that so many of the public don't bother to do their due diligence.

It's v weird that this wasn't a problem under Obama but all of a sudden happened when the democrats elected someone that half the country hated. I don't understand why people didnt vote for her.

<TEXT> The best analogy I can think of for Republican and Democratic politicians is cats and dogs. 

Dems tend not to attack unless they feel their family (community) are being threatened, or unless personally provoked/threatened. Like dogs.

Republicans attack for fun or for personal gain, constantly, even if there's no real reason for it. Like cats.

3/5 of the time when dog walks by my roommate's cat she just lets her pass. 1/5 the time, she'll hiss and spit a threat. The other fifth, she swipes her claws at the innocent dog. For no fucking reason. That's how I see Republicans, but worse, because Republicans seem to attack at every given opportunity, and even invent extra opportunities.   </TEXT>

I love me some Bernie, but them's the facts.  

Edit: Some are taking this as me alleging that Bernie knowingly took advantage of/was complicit in the Russian psyops. I am not saying that. I'm saying that the Russians used Bernie as a means of dividing the Democratic base on a larger scale by spamming pro-Sanders, anti-Clinton news.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Knowing the size of the LGBT community is important for understanding our culture and furthering sociological research. Regardless, some people already hate gay people being themselves in public and this move by the Trump admin will give them more confidence in their bigotry. 

Sexual orientation *is a part of your identity,* whether you realize it or not. If the government strikes LGBT people from the census, it makes it easier for them to stop protecting them from discrimination and hate crimes.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> What's the result of ignoring orientation in the census? 

LGBT people are not recognized by the census. 

The world we live in considers heterosexual to be the default, and straight people outnumber LGBT by quite a lot. No one is going to assume that everyone is gay. People are much more likely to assume that the portion of LGBT people in the population is zero or close enough to zero that it's not worth reporting. 

This is just a way to other-ize the LGBT community.   </TEXT>

And as far as our disagreement on the causes of the civil war goes, I'm not an idiot. I am aware that there were many contributing factors to the secession. In my opinion, which I've come to though, yes, the study of US history, slavery and racism were the most consequential causes.

<TEXT> Disclaimer: I'm an American, so feel free to dismiss literally anything I say that's wrong. I just had some thoughts on your comment. 

Our civil war was over 150 years ago. It is the only war we've ever fought within our own borders (I'm not counting the Revolution as they weren't yet "our" borders then). It was a war started by one side's insistence on ignoring human rights and belief in racial supremacy. It's not a perfect comparison by any means, but it's not bad, either. 

That war was the most costly in American lives and it caused division and pain so deep that the country still hasn't recovered fully  one side of my family still resents the other for being northerners. And slavery will *always* stain American race relations, at least for the foreseeable future. A few months shy of 152 years and it is still there. 

Basically, I don't think it'll ever *not* be part of the social fabric of Europe, but it doesn't have to be a dark cloud hanging over always.  </TEXT>

Only because the people killed there, or at least their survivors, would probably prefer to be remembered in another way. They were people, after all, and people are more complicated than how they die. 

I think the camps are more like monuments than memorials; monuments to the incredible cruelty humans are capable of. 

Regardless, it's a place you need to be wholly respectful while visiting. It's a somber place, so maybe shithead kids should learn basic human decency before desecrating it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Best rebuttal to Holocaust denialism I've heard is: if it didn't happen, why did the defendants at Nuremberg only deny their complicity or responsibility for the mass murder of innocents instead of simply saying "this did not happen?" 

"I was only following orders" is a very different sentiment than "no such thing even occurred." Those men were on trial for their lives, so if the Holocaust hadn't happened, they *definitely* would've said so. By using "orders" as an excuse, it is reasonable to assume they weren't so steadfast in their anti-Semitism and Nazi beliefs that they'd die to protect a conspiracy that horrifying.

His movies poke fun at innocuous, random demographics that no one ever mentions (the swipe at Methodists in Blazing Saddles makes my grandpa, a former Methodist minister, roar with laughter), and uses offensive humor as a jab at bigots rather than minorities by presenting it as a negative side effect of ignorance rather than a statement of fact. 

Seriously, Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, The Producers (both versions, for different reasons), Men in Tights, and Spaceballs are some of the funniest movies in existence. Mel also created Get Smart. 

And Mel's son Max wrote World War Z (the novel), which I love. 

Okay, I'll stop raving about this like a freak now.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've heard that there's a difference in the gut reaction to your own kid, but I suppose that's something I won't know for sure until I have mine. 

And my dad was always sarcastic when I got upset as a young'un, saying things like "yes, you've just got the hardest life ever" when I cried over this or that, and all it really did was introduce me to the fact that I'm *really* privileged. I also credit him with my dry sense of humor and smart mouth. I'd be okay passing all that down... although maybe not the smart mouth, considering what a turd I could be back in high school.

<TEXT> That's good to hear. Because my mom was a teacher and I spent a lot of time in her classroom as a kid, the mom/teacher face stopped affecting me early on (even though she rarely used it on me, I was a well-behaved kid). But I've seen it silently stop a rowdy classful of students in their tracks on many occasions. 

That being said, I was the kid teachers wrote "I wish I had a class full of her" on report cards about, since I was quiet and did my work and liked to read, so mom/teacher face immunity didn't matter. 

I'm no-nonsense as well, but I do love the crap out of my students and would easily step in front of a bullet for any of them. I get annoyed when a student tells me "you're mean" because I'm truly not and the kid has no manners. I wouldn't have dared say something like that to a teacher at any point in my childhood. 

Anyhow, it's good to know that being no-nonsense doesn't make me a cruel caregiver. I do want kids one day, and I don't want to screw them up emotionally *too much*.  </TEXT>

Yeah, no. I don't have to prove myself worthy of debating you, and were I to respond with the correct answers, you'd probably just claim I didn't know them til you asked. Nice attempt at gatekeeping, though.

That being said, I'm gonna have to peace out of this conversation. You're either trolling or honestly believe what you're saying, and I can't figure out which of those would show you in a worse light. I have to hope that you're a troll, because if you actually think that gay couples are inferior parents, that it's okay to liken those couples to dogs, that being pro-choice makes liberals Nazis, and that forcing a baby to live in pain and discomfort is more humane than allowing it a dignified and peaceful death, then I weep for you.

<TEXT> Afaik, there are fewer than ten doctors in the US who preform abortion after 20 weeks.  

It's an incredibly dangerous job. When Dr. Tiller was assassinated by right-wing extremists, only three or four late-term abortion doctors were left in the country. Another of the remaining doctors owned a stable and ran a small home business of watching over people's horses while they were away. The stable was burned to the ground by right-wing terrorists, killing several horses and severely burning most of the others. 

After Tiller was killed (*After Tiller* is the name of an excellent documentary on the other doctors and their lives in the few years following the assassination, by the way), the handful of Tiller's colleagues left realized that their lives were in danger and that, if they were killed, women would be unable to find the help they needed. A few new doctors have since worked with and learned from them, and I believe there's an effort to train as many as are willing to do the procedure.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Killing innocent human beings for convenience  is a medical procedure!!!

Abortion is, no matter what your opinion on it, literally a medical procedure. 

And it's interesting to me that you say "not being able to feed another child" is "convenience."

It's based on the scoience fact that it's a human being that is being exterminated. You know, the offspring of two human beings that conceived it!

I'm loling so hard at the patronizing tone you exude while misrepresenting (and misspelling) scientific fact. 

A human zygote/embryo/fetus is no more than a mass of cells with *the potential* to become a human life. Women's eggs have this potential, as do men's sperm, yet women are not considered murderers when we menstruate nor are men when they masturbate.  

The vast majority of pregnancies end in miscarriage, which is the female body's way of terminating pregnancy when most chromosomal defects are present in the fetus. However, many serious or fatal fetal defects are not "shut down" in this way, and many of those are undetectable until the third trimester. 

In these cases, the fetus is still *technically* a potential human life, but the quality of the child's life would be hellish  asphyxiation, regular invasive medical intervention, sensory deprivation, and constant pain  and short. Even *with* costly and constant medical attention, the child would never live a moment without pain in the short time it were alive. 

Do you consider that a life worth living? Do you think it's less humane to abort the child before it comes into this world than it is to force it to live a short and horrible life? And what of the parents? Would you prefer to helplessly watch your baby suffer for days or weeks, or give it a peaceful death before it leaves the comfort of its mother's womb? 


 All a child needs is a loving support system.

Like a puppy needs, right?

No one likened people to dogs but you. It's a nice indicator of where your mind is, though. 

Gender is irrelevant.


Because children are stupid animals and cant tell, correct?

No. Because they don't care until they're taught to, as you obviously have been. Bigots are created, not born. 


Duh! On what planet does that even make sense that an abusive house is better than say a single loving mother!!!  WHy do you even bring up such an obvious point!!! 

Because your comments have been wildly anti-LGBT and prejudiced, lol. 


Ask the person that was raised by two women!

So you're going to tell a person that their mothers were inferior because a man isn't involved? Or that a woman is required in order to have great parents? I'm gonna just let you sit and think about that whole line of reasoning. 

     And two mothers never will?? What's your point? You think I'm saying even bad mothers and fathers are good? How old are you??

That's true, since it's not likely they can have an accidental pregnancy! So yeah, the data is going to be skewed to make heterosexual parents that can have kids accidentally look worse!

Yeah. So why are you saying that the group of people who will literally *always* have to plan their families and work to get them are inferior parents?


That's why I go by the science fact that it's A HUMAN BEING! The offspring of TWO HUMAN PARENTS!

Again, that is not a scientific fact. It is a mass of cells with the potential to grow into a human being. A mass of cells which takes several months to develop a conscious mind and even longer to become viable outside of it's mother's body. 

I agree. You want to do what the Nazis did. You want to make human beings non-persons so you can throw them in your ovens. 

Fucking lol. Okay, cool, I guess thinking women should decide what to do with their bodies makes me a Nazi. Never mind that Nazis raped Nordic women and forced them to bear officers' children.

That teaches nurture. Caring for life. 

I thought that was the goal of liberals was to make everyone care and help others suffering?

I am of the mind that the best way to keep a child who will die in pain after days of life from suffering is to end its life before it *can* suffer. And I'm not alone in this. It is the most humane way for both the child and the parents.

That's stupid. Dogs cant raise a child!  How old are you!

Lol. I could ask the same of you, friend. 

Yes, I made a spelling mistake once. let's now use that to kill the unborn!

Entire civilization of strawmen up in that sentence. 

Says the person building abortion clinics to exterminate your mistakes!

Hahaha that doesn't even make sense.

That's the same standard for bringing a dog home.

Yes, keep comparing same-sex parents to dogs. That'll win you the argument.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Um. Please look up Margaret Sanger, the founder of PP. She was a eugenecist who wanted to exterminate the black race. So she set up abortion clinics in poor neighborhoods and encouraged the poor (mostly black) moms to kill their preborn infants rather than bring them into this world.

Um. Please provide a source, because Sanger's work in the African American community was done with the likes of W. E. B. Du Bois, cofounder of the NAACP, and was praised by Martin Luther King Jr. Unless literally everything everyone knows about these men is wrong, I don't think they were for the decimation of the black community or eugenics. 

The only reason anyone thinks she was a racist eugenist is because of a letter written by Sanger to another leader of a group providing contraception to poorer black communities which has been misrepresented in conservative media as proof of her supposed racist motives. It's also falsely claimed that birth control was something pushed onto unwitting and unwilling black women, even though a large portion of that demographic had been aware of and wanted access to it even before Sanger began her  minority outreach campaign. 

So, basically, that's a misleading and blatantly false spin on a woman whose legacy in with minorities is nothing but positive. It's been pushed by anti-choice groups as a means of vilifying Planned Parenthood, and it would appear that you swallowed it hook, line, and sinker.

Before you tell others to look something up, you might want to do so yourself. 


Also abortion is not without complications. 

http://www.lifenews.com/2014/12/19/suicide-rate-for-women-having-abortions-is-six-times-higher-than-women-giving-birth/

http://www.lifenews.com/2006/01/02/nat-1941/

Life News is literally an anti-choice opinion site with extreme bias and has a history of reporting falsehoods. It's not a good source. 


You guys also keep saying that conservatives don't care about children after they are born which is far from the truth, especially for religious ppl. They are more likely to support social programs and charities. 
 

Conservatives in the government don't care at all. They're actively trying to dismantle our social safety nets, and their policies most often hurt the poor and middle class and elevate the ultra-rich even further. By voting for these officials, conservatives appear to be either ignorant or supportive of these policies.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> My grandpa is a retired Methodist minister and he gets so damn mad about this misrepresentation. He has legitimately lived closer to the teachings of Jesus than anyone else I've ever known. That meant he fought to desegregate his church in the early 60s, built houses for homeless families in Mexico, helped a Kenyan man attend school in the States and move his family here, and give nearly half of his (not insignificant, he's also a shrewd investor) earnings to charity. He's spent his life trying to live as close to Jesus's teachings as he could, and hell hath no fury like my grandpa when someone speaks hypocritically about Jesus. 

Jesus was an incredible person and deserves to be remembered as he was  the hippie son of an angry, abusive Republican father who hung out with beggars and prostitutes and believed in peace, love, and tolerance above all.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your official party line, (including Hilary....see third debate) supports abortion till the day of delivery. In fact she and obama voted against the partial birth abortion ban. 

If you're a MD as you claim, you should know that abortions near "the day of delivery" don't happen unless the mother's life is on the line. And you should also know that "partial birth abortion" is a name coined by Republicans in Congress in order to brand *all* late-term abortions as violent and inhumane procedures, which they aren't.

<TEXT> You could have stopped at "Liberals teach" since the right keeps trying to defund education at every level and on every topic unless it's about **their fabricated version of Jesus.** 

FTFY. Jesus never said a word about homosexuality or abortion, and he was a proto-socialist who believed in the redistribution of wealth and preached tolerance above all. 

The right's "supply side Jesus" bears no resemblance to the man himself.

<TEXT> That's a different subject that on demand abortion. Which is what this is really about.

It's not a different subject when abortion bans cause women to die because doctors are not allowed to abort and evacuate a late-term pregnancy. 

Then PP should have no problem dropping it in order to get their federal money!

This talking point is ridiculous. Abortion is a medical procedure and PP is a medical provider. In any case, federal funding is not spent on abortion at PP. 

The opposition to abortion is majorly based on religious belief. Religion and government are meant to be entirely divorced from one another in this country. Therefore this argument has no place in politics.

So fathers are irrelevant, eh? I mean, you are proof a father is not necessary, correct?

Wow, the condescension and blatant attempt at trolling. 

All a child needs is a loving support system. Gender is irrelevant. Being raised by two men or two women who give the child unconditional positive regard and stability is better than being raised by a heterosexual couple who neglects their child or can't provide them with a stable life and vice versa. 

No one said fathers are irrelevant but you. 

And two mothers never will?? What's your point? You think I'm saying even bad mothers and fathers are good? How old are you??

With what little data we have on the subject, same-sex parents are much less likely to abuse their kids. This probably has to do with how hard it is for them to *have* children, compared to straight couples who can just *accidentally* end up with ten of them.

That's a good reason for a private citizen to kill another human being?

I don't think arguing the idea of fetus =! person is a valuable use of our time. I just think that you should take into account this difference of opinion when discussing the topic. 


Heath issues or the baby has a fatal illness.

It's eugenics over nurture?

You'd rather a baby be born with zero chance of living anything but a short (meaning days or weeks at most), painful life of impotent and invasive medical intervention and struggle while its parents are forced to watch helplessly? Because that seems more cruel than a painless (for the child) and quick abortion. 

Want to try again?

I think they covered it pretty well, why bother restating it?

For example, liberals understand that science has demonstrated that children raised by same-sex parents are at no disadvantage compared to heterosexual couples.

Dogs also dont need or deserve a mother and father. Are human beings no better than dogs to you?

By drawing this comparison, you've just proved that you yourself consider same-sex parents no better than dogs. 


You forgot to the part where liberals teach that abortion clinics are where you terminate your mistakes.

Have you never made a mistake? Has a preventative measure you've taken never failed? Do you really believe that mistakes and bad luck should have life-shattering consequences, or that people who made mistakes or had bad luck should be forced to take on the awesome responsibility that is raising a child? 

Never mind that not a single liberal I've heard of has encouraged the use of abortion as anything more than a last resort. We tend to focus on teaching sexual responsibility and encouraging contraceptive use. It works much better than shaming teenagers for their natural urges.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A) Liberals cant claim they care more about life while building abortion clinics for the genocide of the poor and undesirable.

I don't think you know what genocide means. Abortion is not something that hurts the poor. Access to abortion and contraceptive services help low-income families financially, whereas abortion/contraception access restrictions make their financial burden even more dire and debilitating. Never mind that the majority of women who have an abortion have children later in life, when they are more able to provide their families with a stable life. 


B) the right has always held that the BEST welfare for children is a ready and married mother and father. Liberals don't teach that high standard.

I'll ignore how dismissive that claim is of same-sex parents (don't worry, I'll make my point on that hideousness elsewhere in the thread) and get to the meat of the issue:

Liberals *definitely* teach that standard. That is why we want to provide people with the option of abortion/contraception in order to plan when and with whom to have children. By defunding PP and restricting abortion access, the GOP forces children to be born into broken, dysfunctional, and destitute homes. 


C) In fact they have abortion clinics because they do  not teach you to wait until you are married and ready. 

In my hometown, all sexual education classes are strictly abstinence-only and do not cover contraception or family planning at all. The teachers responsible for those classes can be fired if they even say the word "condom." 

Incidentally, that city's rate of teen pregnancy and STI transmission is one of the highest in the state, a state which has one of the highest rates in the country. 

Teaching you to keep your dick in your pants or your knees together doesn't work. Literally every peer-reviewed scientific study supports this. And abortion rates are higher in abstinence-only sex ed areas than in areas which teach comprehensive sex ed and safe sex.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Think of it: the issues that caused this monstrosity of an election and presidency are focused on and repaired to ensure it can never happen again. 

Education systems are better funded, media literacy and critical thinking are given more focus, and history is given more attention in public schools. Citizens United is overturned, grassroots campaign funding becomes the norm, and the public remains politically engaged. Candidates' tax returns are a legal requirement and divestiture is required of presidents. Gerrymandering is illegalized and districts are drawn impartially. News media are held to a high standard of factual, nonbiased reporting, and "fake news" is struck down and corrected. The electoral college is either restructured or gotten rid of, and every vote is equal. Green energy is expanded and workers retrained. 

What a pretty picture. I hope that's the one that'll come to pass, and not that one where leprosy is common in the population of Americans who survived the nukes and flooding.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> TrumpCo's rejection of norms is one the most disturbing aspects of his admin.

Abso-tootin'-lutely. They don't give a shit about *obvious* conflicts of interest, much less the appearance of conflicts, as every other WH in my lifetime has. Cheney wasn't even as obviously connected to Halliburton as this administration is to their various puppetmasters, even though we all knew what he was up to. That's disturbing because the possibilities for corruption are unknowable and probably limitless. 


Hubris. The thing about hubris is that it is always fatal. 

Trump is like the protagonist of a Greek tragedy but without any redeemable traits. 


Coverage did not elect him; American stupidity, bigotry and racism did. The GOP ranted non-stop about Obama and anyone capable of reading remained immune to Birtherism, Benghazi and apology tours. The others, which unfortunately is enough to elect someone president, believed it.

I agree that the news coverage is not the sole culprit. Media literacy in this country is shit, the fault for which lies on the shoulders of the Republican legislators who have been gutting public education in the states  and now federally  for decades. The GOP has bred a whole generation of voters willing to swallow news that "feels" right over news that *is* right, and that is the biggest threat to this country since the Cuban Missile Crisis. 

My mom has been a public school teacher since the 90s in Arizona, one of the lowest-ranked school systems in the country by state, so you'll never hear me say that ignorance and poor education  two root causes of bigotry and inequity  are not the worst crises in America right now. The GOP knew what they were doing when they systematically fucked over my entire generation's education. 


Now we have a situation in which western intel cannot rely on the U.S.; Euro militaries must start debating re-arming; China fills the TPP void; all future negotiations with the US must include the possibility of being ignored by the next administration. Mostly, TrumpCo ushers in doubt. Everyone, even our trusted allies, must now question America's word and priorities. 

I agree completely. My quip about Putin was more of an observation than a belief that it was dangerous to the country. This election is the biggest monkey wrench ever thrown into the post-WWII liberal world order, and Putin fucking loves it. Right now, I'm putting my hope into the investigative journalist community to save the world order and the country. If Putin has anything to fear about Trump, it's that Trump's carelessness and impulsiveness will cause the story to blow open, which could lead to war. Our military and our allies outnumber and outgun the Russian military and allies exponentially, and the only way Putin can achieve his goals is by covert means and peace with the US. 


I am way off topic, but I mostly agree with you. I am glad to see r/politics remain a thoughtful place.

No worries  I'm a poli sci and journalism student and can really about this for days.  </TEXT>

The reason it had such an effect on the election was how much airtime it was given. Every day, another batch of nonstory emails were the main story on cable news shows, and so the candidates' policy proposals were never mentioned. 

Hillary's policies were her babies. Policy is what she lives for. Her plans were solid and deeply thought out, whereas Trump's were usually random brain misfirings blurted out during unscripted rallies which CNN covered live and in their entirety. 

If this election had been about actual fitness for president and won on merit, Hillary would've won in a landslide. However, this election was a reality show where the most obnoxious, offensive asshole won on a technicality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This likely explains most of it, subject3355. Manafort, Flynn, Page, Tillerson and Trump all had perfectly legitimate contact with Russians and/or Ukranians. Maybe a bit shady, but all defensible. 

I would only consider those ties defensible if the others didn't exist and, once in office, ***everyone*** in the administration divested their assets, released comprehensive public statements on their connections to Russian officials, and accepted constant scrutiny concerning US-Russia relations.

But, once he takes the nomination--and then the WH--why did they not immediately stop all contact? Hustling an ambassador in the backdoor (not proven, but likely); five phone calls on the day of announced sanctions; tweeting praise of Putin's restraint? 

Hubris. I really think that's the answer. Hubris and narcissism and the "magic R" that Bill Maher talked about.


I agree that up to a couple of months into the primary I am certain Trump and Co just wanted a polishing of the brand and the ego, but once they caught the bus, how could they be so stupid as not to cut all suspicious ties? But then again, this is also the administration who nominated anti-candidates as secretaries and complains about lying photographs. 

Trump managed to survive scandal after scandal after scandal because, at the time, the news media was (whether knowingly or unknowingly) helping him win with wall-to-wall emails coverage.  They think they can still distract and misdirect the journals and public, ignorant of the fact that we're not letting this one slide. 


Nonetheless, thank you for the reply. Some slack should be cut for a group of people who had no expectation of actually winning. 

I don't know about that. I mean, even as a campaign, you'd think they'd be more careful, but Trump isn't one for forethought or caution. I bet Putin is kicking himself over this. </TEXT>

**Initial reports said the nameless man had plunged to his death from the roof of the consulate. . .  consular officials quickly changed the narrative. The anonymous man had not fallen dozens of feet from the roof of the consular building, theysaid, but rather had suffered a heart attack in the security office**, and died. . . . 

. . . the New York City medical examiner isnt sure he had a heart attack after all. . . . 

. . . its proven nearly impossible to find out how he died, who he was, and how, if at all, federal authorities were involved in any investigation.

English-language newsreportssaid Krivov, identified then only as a 63-year-old Russian national and Manhattan resident, was a security officer. But a Novemberreportfrom Sputnik, the English-language Russian media outlet, says he was a consular duty commander. . . . 


. . . **it was Krivovs job to make sure US intelligence agencies didnt have ears in the building**. . . . 

The duty commander would also have **had access to . . . the top secret codebreaker used to encrypt and decrypt messages transmitted between the consulate and other Russian channels**.. . .

Despite being described as a Manhattan resident by the NYPD, Krivov is a phantom in public records. **No one with his name, or any iteration of it, has lived in Manhattan for years**. . . 

An NYPD officer looking at the case file told BuzzFeed News no family was listed. . . .

But when BuzzFeed News went to **Krivovs address, listed in the NYPDs files, at 11 E. 90th St., it wasnt a residence. Its a Smithsonian-owned office building . . .  located a block behind the Russian Consulate, which is at 9 E. 91st St**. One of the consulates public entrances is 11 E. 91st St.

Its unclear how thoroughly or for how long the NYPD investigated Krivovs death. Multiple officials declined to offer any details about the investigation. . . . 

 . . . . With all cases like this, it is investigated by the detective squad, he said. **For some reason it was closed out.**

A separate officer said the case was listed as no criminology suspected, natural causes.

The medical examiners office, though, says **their investigation of Krivovs death remains open**. . .

 . . . others who spoke with BuzzFeed News said **this disconnect between the medical examiners office and the NYPD is not normal**. . . .

Its open until you can get a cause of death.there has to be a complete circuit with a case, said Marq Claxton, a former NYPD investigator. . . .

A separate medical examiner official said **Krivovs body had been released the day after his death, but declined to say to whom the body was released**.. . . 

The NYPDdeniedBuzzFeed News request for the incident report, saying the request did not contain enough details, including the date, precinct, and location of Krivovs death, or the incident number. ***BuzzFeed News request in fact included all of that information.***

It stands to reason that . . . much of the hand-wringing over the incident is due to bureaucratic red tape rather than suspicious circumstances. But given the unique circumstances  and a backdrop of plummeting USRussia relations  the lack of information has done little to quell theories. **The more questions that were asked about Krivov, the less people wanted to talk**.

**The State Department also refused to say whether Krivov was registered as a foreign agent, how long he had been in the US, what his immigration status was, and whether they had any contact with the Russian mission regarding his death**.

The FBI said it was not involved in investigating Krivovs death. It declined to comment further and deferred to the NYPD.

Edit: In the aforementioned follow-up, the FBI admitted to involvement in the investigation. Again, no explanation was given for the descrepancy. 

The NYPD did not give BuzzFeed News an official comment on the investigation. 

Its an open secret, US intelligence officials say, that **the consulate is a staging ground for Russian intelligence operations.Its also a coveted target for US agents.** And its importance, officials say, has been underscored as US intelligence agencies try to get their arms around the Russians sweeping operation to manipulate the US election.

Nov. 8 began with his death, and ended with one of the most contentious political upsets in history. After that, Sergei Krivov simply vanished.

This type of shit is not uncommon for Russian officials and Putin critics who are either loose ends or nuisances.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> 
I was lucky enough to be born in a family of strong feminist men and women who taught me right away that society is not individuals, and that most people who do perpetuate misogyny and bigotry do not do so consciously. Because of that, I didn't go through that "radicalization" period, but I've seen many of my friends do so. 

As with anything, young, new feminists are often not mature enough to separate the person from the group, and it's something that takes time, experience, and education to learn. In all I've learned through study and life, I've come to the conclusion that a) I am blessed to have multiple examples of pragmatic feminists in my family and b) education is the cure to all that ails every society. The more I learned, the more empathetic and humbled by just how much I will *never* know I became. 

Third wave feminism is a group of people who need to learn more about life and philosophy, nothing more than that. Just because they're easy to see on the internet does not mean they're the majority. In fact, the more a person screams about a cause, the less they usually know about it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Judging a movement by its college representation is usually not the best way to form an accurate opinion on said movement. In college, people are still young and naive. They're just learning about these issues, and they tend to be less rational in their discussion and action. 

If you want a good example of modern American feminism, look to our incomparable Michelle Obama. She's the epitome of a strong, smart woman whose actions actually outshine her (incredible) words.

Or Hillary Clinton. She's been smeared to shit by the right, but if you watch "The Choice 2016" on YouTube or just look into her life's work, she is an incredible woman and an incredible person.

When it comes to American feminism, the loud but tiny minority of "kill all men" types give the silently incredible feminists doing good works a bad rap. </TEXT>

In this subreddit it's necessary to mention that you aren't minimizing the suffering of women when talking about the issues men face, and it's always important to mention that, while having a hard time in society knows no gender, men have a much easier time than do women by sheer number of inequities. 

As always, I acknowledge that men and boys face serious issues and pressures from society which need to be addressed. In fact, many/most of the problems *women* face would be lessened alongside those of men. But when discussing women's issues, bringing up men's issues is rarely received well.  </TEXT>

Do you truly not believe that Trump's rhetoric has enflamed racist attacks on minorities? Do you deny that the Trump administration took white supremacists off of the list of hate group subtypes? Has he even acknowledged a single attack done by these groups in his name on his own volition? 

Brushing my take on this phenomenon aside and claiming I won't listen to reason does nothing but discourage conversation and belittle me. It's not much of a defense for you and makes it seem as though you can't come up with a substantive response. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good on you. My dad banned me from dating servicemen when I was younger because a sad amount of them aren't like you or him. 

One of my favorite memories with my dad was when we were out to dinner at chili's and a group of drunken marines sat by us. I was maybe 8 at the time, and the marines were cursing and talking loudly and inappropriately about a woman who worked on base. My dad walked over to their table and told them their behavior was unbecoming, that there were children listening to them, then asked for the name of their CO. He had been out of the marines just a year or so and worked as a civilian contractor for one of the proving grounds, so he was on a first name basis with most of the local officers. He told them that if he had to come over again, he would drop a line to their superiors and they'd be made an example of. 

I respect those who serve, but only when they deserve that respect. My dad taught me how to determine who does by example.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep. I've found myself telling the story of Andr Trocm in Le Chambron-sur-lingon during WWII lately. 

Trocm was the priest at the local church, and therefore a local leader. When the Gestapo came to his village and demanded a list of Jewish villagers, Trocm replied "we do not know of Jews, we only know of men." His leadership and compassion during the war led his entire village to form an Underground Railroad of sorts for fleeing Jews and it's estimated that 3500 innocent lives were saved by their efforts. 

All it takes is *one* person stepping forward and resisting to inspire hundreds more. Reminding ourselves of the most incredible examples of that, like Trocm, his nephew (who died in Majdanek concentration camp for his efforts), his flock, and other heroes like them doesn't trivialize the holocaust. It gives it more meaning.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you haven't seen it, I recommend *The Day Kennedy Died*, a documentary which outlines that tragic day moment by moment. It's on Netflix iirc. 

I've always felt a deep, personal sadness for Jackie, and that doc does a wonderful job of explaining what she did and felt and what was done for her. Her personal Secret Service bodyguard is one of the interviewees and his account is gut-wrenching. 

The most emotional part for me was when she said goodbye to get husband. His body was lying in the hospital room under a sheet, and, as she left the room, she noticed his foot was uncovered. She took his foot in her hand, kissed it, and covered it before being escorted out by her bodyguard.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I grew up in a medium-sized border town, 80% Hispanic, most of the white population was military, as was my dad. 

Off-base, I got called "gringa" a few times, mostly affectionately. On base, where the demos skewed the other way, I heard some of the most disgusting and ignorant racist garbage. 

I was all but adopted by my best friend's (formerly undocumented) parents despite the language barrier, and I love the cultural emphasis on family togetherness. It's disgusting the stereotypes and inhumanity that so many in our country spew about the Latino community.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> within his time and culture... Muhammad was actually a wonderful person as were his teachings.... he could give today's liberals a run for their money! He was a "leftist" through-and-through. 

The very same is true of Jesus in the bible. The man was a proto-socialist pacifist who fed the hungry, healed the sick, loved the earth, respected women (even though the bible has painted Mary Magdalene a prostitute and the Vatican has refused to acknowledge gospels which are more flattering), pitied the rich, and preached tolerance and love above all else. 

It's not like the New Testament has changed at all in recent years. It's all there. Yet the evangelical prosperity gospel and perverted supply-side Jesus have taken over American understanding of the religion. Jesus himself would not recognize the version of him that's been created by the religious right.

Ugh, why can't the writers think of original plot lines anymore? I swear, the first 220 seasons of *America* were solid, but lately it feels like they're trying too hard. They're stealing story arcs from literary classics and are even rehashing their own. Like, Nixon's character was realistically flawed and the Watergate season was compellingly written, but this Trump guy, and his Russia thing? No finesse in the script whatsoever.

Shame, too. For awhile there it was the best series I knew. </TEXT>

That and "paid protesters" seem to be the republican means of discrediting the social movements against Trump, yeah.  

And even *if* his argument held any water, I fail to see how it's a worthwhile criticism. First, it's not like the women who didn't vote can go back in time, and second, in what world is political engagement of women a bad thing?

White women did show up to vote.

Helluva Freudian slip. 

And literally every single demographic had low turnout this election.

Accept the responsibility instead of marching after the fact.  

I gladly accept responsibility for my actions. I accept responsibility for canvassing on behalf of a senatorial candidate, phone banking on election day, voting early, and helping organize rallies. 

Do I "deserve" to march? 

Grow up. That kind of divisive rhetoric is the biggest challenge America, and more specifically, the democratic party, have to face going forward.

Edit: also, yeah. It sucks that Trump had to happen to get people to wake up to their civic duty. I wish it hadn't taken a (hopefully only metaphorical) nuclear bomb like Trump's election to get people engaged. But I'm going to take the engagement as a silver lining, not another reason to blame a huge group of people for something with nuanced and complex causes. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-02-16 05:52:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I (21, F) was on 60mg cymbalta for about six months and it worked wonders for my depression and anxiety, but the fatigue and lethargy never went away and I was severely unmotivated to do anything but sleep. I went to the doctor and he's having me try 50mg pristiq instead. 
I've been taking it for 5 days and my tiredness has gotten worse, plus I feel woozy and just, idk, off since I started it. Plus when I spend any time out in the real world, I feel totally wrong and get emotional when I get back home, crying and anxious, the whole bit. 

Idk what's going on, I feel horrible and alone, and I just want to feel normal. Even typing this out has me in tears and I hate it. Is this just because I'm switching meds, and will it all go away? I hate being tired all the time and this switch was supposed to help that, instead it's made it and everything else worse. 

If anyone has any experience with this kind of thing or with switching from cymbalta to pristiq, I'd appreciate your insight. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Music is a really important therapy tool for me, and after my best friend took her own life this summer, I found solace in it. I built a playlist of songs right after the funeral to help me cry things out and I think it really helped me work through my emotions. If anyone is interested, here it is (warning: all of these *will* make you cry. For me, that was the point): 

**1. [Through My Prayers  Avett Brothers](https://youtu.be/ZiwVmUDWkkQ)**

Painfully accurate description of grief, regret, and the hard lessons of losing a loved one. The Avett Brothers are incredible lyricists and I also recommend "Winter in my Heart," "Laundry Room," and really all of their music. 

Every night after and every day since

I've find myself crying when the memory hits

Sometimes it knocks me down,

Sometimes I can just put it away.

**2. [Pictures of You  The Cure](https://youtu.be/-56h8d3gLgk)**

I spent a lot of time looking at old pictures of her since she took her life this summer. This song expresses how it feels to obsess over whatever you have left of that person, remembering the happy times and sad, and wondering what you could've done differently.

The Cure was her favorite band, and so they hold a special place in my heart. This one and "Lovesong" both tear me apart. 

If only I'd thought of the right words,

I'd could've held onto your heart.

If only I'd thought of the right words,

I wouldn't be breaking apart.

**3. [Transatlanticism  Death Cab for Cutie](https://youtu.be/jErtD0Gi-i4)**

This song describes an insurmountable distance between the singer and someone he loves. I bet we all know the feeling.

I need you so much closer...

Really, most of Death Cab's album Transatlanticism could go on this playlist.

 **4. [The Beacon  A Fine Frenzy](https://youtu.be/G-T3pn5shcg)**

A girl fighting for a loved one that wants to commit suicide.

You say your time has come,

You're tired of waking up.

Don't be obscene, 

I can't conceive

Of living without you.

**5. [Resurrection Fern  Iron   Wine](https://youtu.be/2QyVfs5G2uA)**

Frankly, the lyrics are so metaphorical that I have no idea what it's about, but it's truly beautiful. Same goes for all of Iron   Wine's music. 

**6. [Hear You Me  Jimmy Eat World](https://youtu.be/537v5Avw_mU)**

Heart. Breaking. A raw and honest expression of pain, gratitude, hope, and love to someone gone before their time.

And if you were with me tonight,

I'd sing to you just one more time,

A song for a heart so big,

God wouldn't let it live.

**7. [The Brightest Bulb Has Burned Out/Screws Fall Out  Less Than Jake](https://youtu.be/6qyJ4iiuwU8)**

I've known this song since I was 11, and I'd always liked it. I hadn't heard it in years until I broke out my old iPod just after the funeral. This song came on shuffle as I was walking to work and it broke me. It's like the writer had listened to one of the many conversations she and I had over the years. 

So I'll let you know, 

If you need somewhere to go,

I'll be listening when you call 

And I'll be there if you fall off.

If you need someone to believe in you,

I'll let you know, 

I will.

**8. [Mary  Scissor Sisters](https://youtu.be/6h5SQhcNY8A)**

This song has a sad backstory. The writer and singer befriended a woman over a phone chat line when he was struggling with his sexuality. She was very obese and wanted to get a gastric bypass but couldn't afford it. He told her that if his band ever made it big, he'd get it for her. Of course, the band made it and he paid for the surgery. She died due to surgical complications. This song is about her.

Cause I'd give everything I have

Forget all the things that bring me joy

If you could have one day

Of pure and simple happiness

**9. [A Better Place, A Better Time  Streetlight Manifesto](https://youtu.be/JXdnYgJy4fs)**

Begging, pleading, trying to convince his lover not to take her own life.

And when you wake up

Everything is going to be fine

I guarantee that you wake up in a better place

And in a better time.

**10. [The World Has Turned and Left Me Here  Weezer](https://youtu.be/B_nuZ4cPBrQ)**

Pure, unadulterated grief.

The world has turned and left me here

Just where I was before you appeared

<TEXT> I understand the curiosity. Really, I do. But making the process of rooting out evidence of hacking public is a stupid thing to do and the agencies know it. If they tell the world exactly how they investigated and found the evidence which led them to their conclusion means Russian hackers will know too. They'll be able to circumvent the probing process and fuck with us even more. 

The 17 agreeing intelligence statements *are* the evidence. That's how it works. People need to learn the difference between healthy skepticism and anti-intellectualism.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'll list a few of the things that Reagan accomplished, and I encourage all of you to add to the list. 

-**His tax cuts for the wealthy caused a huge economic crisis.** Turns out, cutting taxes across the board doesn't help the economy after a period of massive inflation,  *even when you make sure to cut the top bracket by 70%!* Who would have thought?


-**Double-dealing in the Iraq-Iran war and failure to condemn atrocities against civilian populations**. Reagan supplied Saddam Hussein's Iraq with weapons during the Iran-Iraq war, knowing that the Iraqi soldiers were using chemical weapons on civilians. When presented with a U.N. agreement to condemn Hussein, he vetoed it. He was *also* supplying Iran with weapons concurrently.

-**Iran-Contra** too complicated for me to type out, [here's a link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair?wprov=sfla1) to the Wikipedia entry. Basically, he gave weapons to terrorists in trade for releasing hostages (which didn't work) and to fund "freedom fighter" death squads in Nicaragua. 

**Supported the South African Apartheid government**. After passing easily through Congress, the Anti-Apartheid Act was vetoed by Reagan. 

-**Ignoring the AIDS crisis**. Reagan never acknowledged or attempted to help during this plague, which killed *millions* of Americans, because it mostly affected the gay community. He even proposed funding cuts for AIDS research.

<TITLE> Weird wave sensation on my brain... If anyone else has felt this and didn't die of it, please ease my mind, I'm freaking out. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-01 10:47:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First off, my general info - 

I [21F] have been diagnosed and on medication (Adderall 20mg IR 3x daily) for ADHD-PI for one year. Last week, I began counseling and have been diagnosed with dysthymia, GAD, and hypochondria. I will be starting antidepressants within the next 2 weeks, and I've been taking St. John's Wort for a month. 

So here's what happened: 

I was sitting on my bed, just out of a hot shower, and I suddenly felt this weird wave of pressure inside the front right side of my head. It's hard to explain. The best I can do is it felt like someone gently pressed the bottom of their hand on my brain, then rolled their hand down to the front right side, or like the right frontal lobe was falling to the right while the rest stayed still. It only lasted a few seconds, and it was very intense but not debilitating. All I could do was sit there and think "this isn't good." It didn't hurt at all, but I've had a slight headache that comes and goes by my right temple in the hours since, and I've been dizzy and unfocused. I haven't noticed any cognitive issues; I can still talk, walk, type, and see, which were the first things I tried to do after I regained my composure because I needed to know I hadn't just had a stroke or aneurysm.

Of course, being who I am, I Googled possible reasons. I'm not on pharmaceutical antidepressants, which was the most common search result, so I kept searching, which was not a comfort.

Logically, a few things might have caused the weirdness. I had taken my ADHD meds before getting into a hot shower, and my heart rate might've been a little elevated, plus I haven't eaten in probably 11 hours (depression-related appetite problems). None of the online results had anything to do with Adderall by itself, though. Another possible cause mentioned was quick, repetitive back-and-forth eye movement, and I'd been skimming my Netflix lists for 20 minutes or so before it happened.

I'm probably overreacting. I'm a hypochondriac, and this was a horrible new sensation. I worry over minor abdominal pain (it's always gas, *but what if this time I'm wrong and die??*) so this got me spiralling. I'm freaking out, worried I've got MS or I'm about to have a neurological disorder named after me. I can't stop worrying about it. My mind is going 600 miles a minute, back and forth between telling me I'm dying and trying to come up with reasonable explanations, then rejecting them immediately because I'm so sure I've got a tumor or or AVM or blah blah fuckety blah I'm tired 

Sorry, got off-track there :/... has anyone else had that feeling? Does anyone know what it is? Is it anxiety-related? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Even if we weren't blood, we were family.  My parents loved you like a daughter, and I loved you like a sister. I got the call while I was on vacation, riding in the back seat while my mom pointed out places she and my dad had gone when they first started dating. The sudden change in my voice from happy to numb during that one-minute phone conversation scared them. They needed to know what was wrong. 

I told them. Mom broke down. Dad kept his composure until we arrived at my aunt's house, where we stood in the driveway in shocked silence. I've witnessed my father cry twice in my life: the first was during his eulogy for my grandpa; the second was in that driveway.

I flew home early for your funeral. The last time I had seen your loved ones, we were in high school. Sitting at the kitchen counter, laughing and gossiping while we ate homemade frijoles and fresh tortillas faster than your mom could make them. All of my memories with your family were happy ones until that day.


I saw your brother first. When he looked at me, he started to cry. "I didn't want to see you here," he told me, "you remind me of her too much. She was so happy when you were around, she loved you." He hugged me as we wept, and I finally understood that you were gone. Seeing him made it real.

Then I saw your mother. She stood up to embrace me and collapsed in my arms. I held her up and guided her back to the seat. She was in a hundred million pieces, and had been unable to eat or sleep since you died. All she could do was cry louder than I thought possible, with more pain than I though humans could withstand. Your father remained stoic. His wife needed someone to lean on. 

Your sister cried so hard that she physically couldn't anymore. Her heartbreaking, beautiful eulogy was spoken in a wavering voice, and she was constantly on the verge of losing her composure. Through my teary eyes, she looked just like you. 

My parents came home a few days later, as we couldn't afford to all come back early. They'd found the pictures you took on that disposable camera during our first trip to the mountains together, your first time seeing snow. We made a snowman and you sat next to him, grinning like a fool and flashing a peace sign for a picture. It's now framed and sitting on your mom's bedside table.

All four of your parents cried in the driveway of the house we had sleepovers in every other week, holding a picture of their late daughter, happy, in the snow. 

Today, one month has passed since we stood in the cemetery holding roses for your casket. I wish you knew how much we loved you. You died because you didn't want to burden us, not knowing that you'd never be a burden.

We all miss you so much.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You ended your life one month ago today. In a week, it will have been one month since we buried you. 

I had my old iPod on shuffle while I was walking to work today. It played a song I haven't heard in years. I'd always liked it -- the lyrics are beautiful and full of love -- but I had never had an emotional connection to it. Until today. 

It said everything I wanted to say to you before it happened, and it resembled our conversations in the months leading up to your death so much it was uncanny. It even got your age right. 

It knocked the wind out of me and I started crying. I miss you so much, babe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I knew A was depressed. She had been for years. When we met, we were in seventh grade and she cut herself. She told me, the day after she had been caught sneaking out of her bedroom window to meet her boyfriend, that she would rather kill herself than face her parents. I told her not to, I was there for her, and she lived through her parents' disappointment and punishment. 

The number of times she cried her eyes out with her head on my chest in the two years of middle school, I don't even know. 
We went to separate high schools, and lost our closeness and contact for a year. Because of a boy, of all stupid reasons. But we came back together. Of course we did. No one could make me laugh the way she did, and no one understood her better than I. She told me that she had attempted suicide within the last few months. She downed a bottle of sleeping pills, or most of one, and woke up the next day feeling like human garbage. But she was alive. I told her that she needed to see a professional, but she didn't want to. She thought she should be able to get well alone. Seeing a psychiatrist would make her weak. 

She went off to college. She was brilliant, a natural scientist, and wanted to major in genetics. We talked occasionally. Sometimes we were happy, sometimes we were trudging through shit, but we still talked. She called me whenever she felt overwhelmed, and I told her how strong she was and how amazing it was that she tried so hard. Everything seemed like it was getting better. 

Then she met her husband. They got married fast -- too fast, I think. He was enlisted, and would make more money as a married man than singly. He had anger issues, and he was possessive and became abusive. But they were married, and that was that. She felt obligated to make it work with him. The calls became less regular. 

I got a text from a friend at 4 in the morning today, saying "call me." I looked at it and promptly fell asleep again. Six hours later, as I was driving doing vacation things with my family, my (other) best friend called me. She told me that A was dead, but she didn't know details. She just didn't want me to find out by reading some stranger's Facebook obit. A's mother told me she committed suicide, and I had this horrible crystalizing moment. Of course she had. Her secret marriage to an abusive man, her crushing sense of inadequacy, her conviction that she was worthless, and God knows what else she hadn't been telling me about... 

I'm a mess. I can't help thinking I should have been there. I could have stopped her. 

Why didn't she call me? </TEXT>
