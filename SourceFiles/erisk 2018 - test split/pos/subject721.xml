<TEXT> It pisses me off you can even name bills like that. They're designed to frame you in a negative light simply for speaking out against it.

"I don't support the Patriot Act" what are you, a terrorist!? But that's a lot easier than referring to the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act.

A controversial one in NY is the Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act, or "Safe Act". Because again, if you come out and say "I don't support the Safe Act" you immediately sound like a crazy gun nut and people will discredit you. (Not saying I'm for or against it, simply using its name as an example).

I don't know what the word is for doing this, but honestly this shit bugs me and I think it's *really* bad for democracy in general. The names are designed to immediately sway your opinion before you know what is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **EDIT** I am literally the dumbest person on the earth. Apparently this venue has 2 stages and I was at the wrong one. Better luck next year :(

Last week I found out TYS was playing at a small venue this weekend. I'm not familiar with their stuff, I couldn't name you a single song or album but I know I've liked what I've heard on this subreddit so I decided to check them out.

Wikipedia lists 7 individuals as active band members, but there were only 4 or 5 people on stage.

When they tour, do they not have the 'jazz ensemble' with them? Because I definitely didn't see anyone with a violin, saxophone, or trumpet.

In either case it was a pretty good show. Only like 15 people showed up, which I think was the smallest concert I've ever been to, with a close second to Epica back in 2007 -- their first US tour -- which had about 30 or 40 people. But yea, despite the small crowd and lack of live jazz it was still a pretty good show. I was just curious if that was a typical thing for them or what. </TEXT>

Then, despite damn near everyone he's surrounded himself with being investigated for Russian compromises, he's trying to play it cool and say it's the Dems that are in Russian pockets?

But if it's no big deal for half your associates to be tied to Russia, why is it a big deal for the Dems to suddenly, allegedly, be tied to Russia? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm all for legalizing prostitution, but:

Police say they also found pills, a stamp bag of heroin and other drug paraphernalia in her dresser drawer. Police say Chalmers' 15-year-old son was in a back bedroom during the entire incident.

 Police say they found her in a second-floor, locked bathroom with drug paraphernalia. Vareha's 4-year-old son was in the living room. The boy was handed over to his grandmother and CYF was notified.

These women absolutely should be in trouble. No child should have to go to a home where his or her parent is fucking complete strangers for money.

It's simply dangerous for everyone involved. The kids, the "sellers", and even the "buyer" are all at risk here.

If you want to open up a business and have the workers and clients be tested, great. All the power to you. But fucking strangers for money with young children home isn't a good idea. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure I understand:

 The original bill claimed drivers who rolled coal intended to harass other peoplelanguage that concerned some senate Republicans.

 However, in order to successfully roll coal in a diesel truck, an illegal device called a smoke switch has to be installed, which is what allows the engine to suck in more diesel fuel and produce the thick clouds of black smoke from the exhaust. Original supporters of the bill argued that installation of such a device was evidence of intent, but the bill wasnt budging until that part was taken out.

I thought "rolling coal" was simply an ECU tune so it burns rich? Not really a "switch" at all.

Additionally, if the switch is *already* illegal then why did the supporters want that removed from the bill? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wouldn't necessarily say they "support communism" but I think it's easy to see why many youths in America would be fed up with modern capitalistic society.

'The American Dream' has become "I hope I can pay off my student loans" rather than, "I hope to buy a house".

Many people are, to some degree, wage slaves. Don't get me wrong, I live pretty comfortably for my age, especially considering that I pay $1K/mo in student loans... But I can't do anything. I can't afford to live alone. I can't afford to travel (like I even have the time off to travel if I *could* afford it). I can't afford to spend much on hobbies.

If I lose my job, I'm fucked. My debts would clean out my savings in no time. When I pay off these existing debts, **then** I can start saving up to get started on that 30-year mortgage for a house.

Meanwhile companies give salaries to CEOs so big one would have to try *real fucking hard* to spend all of it. Don't get me wrong, my boss' boss works 24/7 and I think he deserves to make whatever he makes. But I work for a small 60-person company. But then you look at the huge banking industry, ISP/Telecom companies and all these other huge industries and it just disgusts me. Morally bankrupt businesses which will shaft every single person who works there if it'll get the shareholders more money. "We can't afford to pay our IT department overtime" they say while giving multi-million dollar bonuses to all the bigwigs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look into knocking out your Gen Ed courses at a cheap community college, then transfer to a different school to get your actual degree. There's no reason to pay State University Money for things like writing or math (unless that's your actual degree, I suppose).

It can be tricky though, lots of schools are very particular about what can and cannot be transferred.

Also, in my opinion, if you don't know what you want to major in... Don't go to college. Wracking up tens of thousands of dollars of debt with no "end game" is a crazy idea.

I might even go as far as to say consider the field's employment before you get a degree. A buddy of mine has his PhD in some sort of marine biology field and can't find any work because it's such a specialized degree. So he's stuck teaching part time at a college while repaying these massive loans.

Of course, certain individuals can make any degree work for them, if they're smart/skilled enough and networked well. But for the most part, if you earn a degree in a field that is not in demand... Good luck. </TEXT>

I told him I'd reimburse him for gas and that he should put 93 in it (very easy to find where I live), and that he is not to eat in it.

So he drops me off at the airport, and I find out my flight was cancelled. He turns around and comes to pick me up... And he's eating fucking Dunkin Donuts in the car.

We get home and I go out for a drive, get out and just went to brush my pants off and I got something on my hands. A bit of cream fell between his legs and onto the leather seats, got nice and smooshed into the pores... And all over my suit pants.

Next day I had my dad take me to the airport and I *forgot* to leave my keys with him, for my brother.

Sorry not sorry. Not 30 minutes and he already broke 1 of the 2 rules.

So yea... I'd be apprehensive of loaning my car to anyone.

<TEXT> You know what would be a decent place to start? Paying IT employees overtime.

The OT laws in the US haven't been updated in over 20 years for IT workers. And back in '96 when they were updated, they changed it from [6.5 Min Wage] to be a flat [6.5 Min Wage in 1996].

So if you make more than $27.63/hr, you are exempt from overtime eligibility.

Forget the snacks and the cool break room or the massages or that other crap. Fucking pay me when you tell me I need to work until 2AM on a Friday.

Oh well.

And yea, I went from the Z to the Fit. My logic was, "If I'm going from almost 300HP and RWD to *something practical* it's just going to feel like a tease so I may as well jump into the deep end of the Practicality side."

At the time, no dealers had a Fiesta ST for me to test drive and I did not like a regular Fiesta so I just said fuck it and went with the Fit. Fortunately I have good credit, so it was doable... Definitely a very stupid decision from a Financial perspective. But hey, it's a lower interest rate **and** a lower principal than any of my student loans. So I got that going for me? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  have a great MT

Have you driven a 2016 or newer?

I bought one and got rid of it 6 months later. One of the major reasons was the 6MT.

Say you're cruising around in any manual. You rev it high, let off the pedal and they drop, then harshly get on the pedal again. The car kind of jerks, as you would expect it to.

The 2016 Fit I had would do this... Except it would do this without me ever changing the throttle. It would just chug **as if** I were repeatedly taking my foot off the gas, then floor it.

It would only happen in first gear, and if I immediately shifted into second it was fine. But yea sometimes I'd shift into first at a red light, give it a little gas and keep my foot steady and then it just starts going nuts.


Other than that, overall a great car for what it is. I just wasn't the demographic for it and thought I could convince myself I'd be OK with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also, why do Italian cars always seem to self-immolate? 

This is all largely speculation as I'm not super knowledgeable about Italian or German cars.

I assume it's a combination of 2 things:

* Mid/Rear engine
* Is it a track car or a GT car?

Point number one seems obvious. You've got the engine and the exhaust all bundled together in one spot. That's a lot of heat, which simply invites the chance for things to catch on fire. I saw one video of a Lamborghini, I think it was, catching fire when the Valet revved it hard too close to a fucking shrub in their parking lot.

As for number two, I'd like to again point out this is purely a guess. But I would say that Porsche, for the most part, is more of a GT manufacturer. As such, they're probably more "willing" to spend the engineering time, money, and weight, to ensure their vehicles are going to be problem-free in that domain. Plenty of cooling for long drives and such. I suppose Ferrari has plenty of GT cars rather than "track focused" cars but even still they've always stuck me as being on a higher level and as such would still have more issues with heat/fire. </TEXT>

Both the FiST and my student loans will be paid off in 2022. That's $1300 I *won't* be throwing at banks every month.

Who knows what the market will be like in 5 years. And hopefully I'll be making a good bit more than I do now.

Right now I'd like a 370Z Nismo, Focus RS, or a used Exige/Elise. All of which would be obtainable today if not for my student loans (although /r/personalfinance would kill me for spending such a large percent of my income on something guaranteed to depreciate).

I do plan on saving to buy a house when my current debt is taken care of, so who knows how that might effect my car budget too. Maybe I'll keep the FiST as a daily and buy something cheap for an autocross project. Who knows. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dr. David Dao announced today his purchase of a Caribbean Island.
Not a large one but big enough to land his new private jet on. 

You'd be surprised how cheap an island is!

$275K really isn't that much, even if it's only 2 acres. </TEXT>

<TEXT> UA was within their right to call the police.

I think the cops handled it piss poorly, but given America's attitude towards airport security I don't think he'd have had much of a case for excessive force or anything like that in the courts -- even with the dozens of people who recorded the incident on their cellphones, sadly.

I don't think he'd have won. Or at least, not without some very expensive legal expertise.

Edit: Alternative theory is that maybe the dude simply didn't care all that much? I'm not greedy. I'd settle for $5M and get everything behind me rather than fight in the court for however long a case like this would take even if I might get $20M or something. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Settlements *are* usually quite quick, aren't they? That's the whole point of settling outside of court.

"Here take this and just shut up."

I think the guy probably knows he wouldn't get millions and probably agreed to a 6 or 7 figure amount.

I think UA calling the police was a poor choice, but to my understanding they were within their legal right to do so. And given how this country is with airport security, I don't think he'd have gotten much if he went after the cops.  </TEXT>

I have a much harder time taking things in just listening -- especially if I'm doing other stuff. Or if I need to pause and rewind it's a pain in the ass because a chapter might be 30 minutes or longer. Trying to back up 30 seconds is difficult on touch devices, or even a lower-resolution monitor with a mouse.

Also, I can pull up Google Play Books on my work computer and read when it's slow at work. Much harder to pretend like I'm busy with headphones on while listening to an audio book.  </TEXT>

Even with Google's vast sums of wealth, you greatly underestimate how much time it would take to do this. Getting the fiber set up. Complying with any individual state laws. Hiring techs, customer service reps, offices for customers to go in and pay bills.

Not to mention being inundated with legal battles filled against them from every ISP in the area. Even if they're shit cases that don't have much to stand on, it still needs to be dealt with.

Yes, allowing ISPs to behave in such a poor manner should create a demand for a more 'ethical' service provider... But it's just not that simple.  </TEXT>

Every type of racing has such strict regulations, manufacturers can't try anything new even if they wanted to.

This year the WRC made some pretty significant increases to the performance of their cars, and journalists kept posting about "the return of Group B" because they know it would get clicks. Group B my ass; back in the day damn near anything was allowed and the number of production models required was vastly lower than today's requirements. It's never ever going to be like that again, regardless of whether or not today's cars are faster and safer.  </TEXT>

I know it's a selfish and shitty thing to do but I just have a tough time talking with my parents.

Either she bitches about her asshole boss or updates me on how many squirrels/rabbits the dog has caught, or some neighbor's dog or... It's all just very 'microcosmic'. I just really don't give a shit. Then I have little to talk about because my life is quite stable. I'm a single male with a steady job who does the same things on the same days each week, and my parents don't get my hobbies/interests.

Then I feel bad for *not* talking with my dad if I talk with my mom. He is an alcoholic and he wasn't physically abusive to me as a kid but he was definitely a real fucking asshole. So we don't get along great. He's working on sobriety after seriously fucking up his life due to alcohol last year. I don't think he's particularly happy with life and has a shit job then works around the house when he's not at his actual job, so he rarely has stuff to talk about -- and again, no common interests so I can't talk much about my interests because he doesn't understand. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you should be there.

I was 18 or 19, we had my dog since he was a puppy. He was about 9 years old when we had to put him down.

He was **very** protective and would bark at everyone and anyone when he heard the door to the house open. Hell, usually as soon as he hears a car pull into the driveway he'd be barking. Anyways, I came home from work one day to a quiet house. That's weird. My mom was sitting on the couch and I immediately ask where the dog is, and that's when she told me he had to be put down.

She said she had the option to wait before the vet did it but she didn't want us 'to go through that'.

I'm not angry at her decision or anything, but I definitely would've liked to say goodbye. </TEXT>

I'm paraphrasing, I have no idea what I said at time, but the jist was "Here's an idea, how about you don't shit on me when I'm trying to improve my cooking skills and instead you just help me". Whatever I said definitely wasn't that douchey but ultimately she got mad at me because I was tired of her making fun of me when I'd ask for help.

<TEXT> I think there are many factors at play, but I thin there's a certain distinction between "DLC" and "micro-transactions".

I suppose it depends on exactly what you classify as "content" in the phrase "Downloadable Content" but to me DLC is akin to an "expansion pack". You're buying for something that adds a not insignificant amount of content to the video game. Perhaps a new class or character. New zone(s). Things like that.

MTX on the other hand, I see as insignificant things such as skins or things that don't make any *real* difference to the game.

I can't believe the whole Horse Armor thing was over a decade ago. I can't even remember what I was playing then, never mind what the "gaming landscape" was like in terms of DLC/MTX. But as you / others have said, I think ultimately nowadays gamers are simply sick and tired of feeling like they need to buy DLC to play with their friends, or get fatigued playing these massive open world games and as such have started to favor cosmetic-only models.

Also, I don't think it's *entirely* fair to compare Steam Market prices for items. It's not reflective of what content creators charge for goods. It's totally open to let people pay whatever they are willing to pay.

That said, I think multiplayer vs singleplayer plays a huge role in how it's perceived. Why would I pay for some mediocre looking armor that literally no one but me will ever see in a single player game? People don't even like pre-order cosmetic exclusives, let alone paying extra for it today. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know very little about this sort of thing, but from my understanding a major reason Ford isn't developing an RS is because the Fiesta is just too small.

I'm not saying swapping a Golf R drivetrain WOULDN'T work, but:

* Golf R wheelbase is 103.5", Fiesta is 98"
* Golf is 168" long, Fiesta is 160"
* Golf is 70" wide, Fiesta is 67"

Again I'm far from an expert, and obviously the drivetrain doesn't take up the full length/width of the vehicle, but it sounds like you'd have to do a lot of adjustment to make it fit.


The said, there's a way to make it work because [this monstrosity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Fiesta_RS_WRC) exists. </TEXT>

Hearthstone has to concern itself with card expansions and such since only certain sets are valid for competitive, right? So no one's going to buy cards if there's a new set every month or every other month. That's not long enough to get much value out of the cards before they're "out of season". </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wish my kidney stone was that "easy".

I just turned 18. On the morning of my last day at my summer job before starting college the following week, I woke up due to the most intense pain I ever experienced. Laying down hurt. Walking hurt. Sitting hurt. I could do nothing to relieve the pain.

My mom took me to the hospital and they loaded me to with pain killers and it was much better. They did some scans and quickly found the rock in my kidney. They said it was **too big** to break up via ultrasound; it would simply break apart into smaller stones.

The doctors kept me there for 24 hours to pump me full of fluids, in an attempt to get me to pass the stone. No such luck.

I had surgery scheduled 2 weeks later to have it removed.

For two weeks, I lived with this big ass rock that could move without notice and throw me into a crippling pain. And as I mentioned above, I was just about to start college... Commuting 50 miles each way. I was super scared of it happening while driving.

Fortunately, it only moved on the weekends when I was around the house. One day it was so bad, if I ate or drank or tried to go to the bathroom I would puke from the pain. Got sent to the ER that night because there was a risk of serious dehydration.

Eventually got it removed. They had to play a Crane Grab game. Shove a camera and a little claw up my dick, pull the fucker out, and stick a catheter in.

Having that in me was extremely unpleasant. Pissing blood is disgusting. Having the nurse try and start a lawnmower with my ripcord was very close to the worst part of the whole ordeal, but not as bad as the long-lasting pain of the stone movements. Or the fear of a movement.


Fuck kidney stones, man. </TEXT>

Bone stock, but I've been meaning to replace the rear motor mount. And some day I want to buy Cobb's "Stage 3" package. Tune, intercooler, intake + exhaust. $3K gives "+20%HP and +40% torque" according to Cobb.

I'm completely OK with 220HP and 280 lb-ft of torque in a car that only weighs 2700 lbs. </TEXT>

Resist the urge to post whatever menial thing happened to you on a given day. Resist the urge to post another selfie; no one forgot what you look like. Unfollow people.

At this point, I basically use Facebook for:

* Keeping track of Events happening at a variety of local places: concert venues, motorsports, and local gaming shops
* Following bands I listen to. I dislike subscribing to record labels' mailing lists because it's easy to overlook news about bands I actually like as they send you stuff about all the bands they've signed. So FB is, IMO, a good way to get updates from the bands I care about in regards to new albums, tours, and other news.
* Communicate with my D D groups. Honestly I'd rather just have a group text going, but whatever. There are arguments for using something other than texting; easier to share PDFs, separate discussions etc.

I very very rarely ever actually post status updates, photos, share stuff, or comment on people's statuses. </TEXT>

I'd probably also react poorly to a girl laughing at it, but I still think it's just a weird behavior.

Would you, OP, be "shaken up" if a guy laughed at your vagina?

But yea as others have said, I think if you simply apologize then explain, "Well, it was contorted when I pulled it out, I never saw it like that before. You **know** I like it, I'm sorry I laughed" then you should be OK as long as he's a level dude. </TEXT>

Just under $22K.

If you're in the market for a fun car under $25K and **have** to have used, it's probably not a bad buy for $22K.

But I suspect I'd take my Fiesta 10/10 times.

I will concede that I like the [dash](http://images.autotrader.com/scaler/920/640/hn/c/927219114ba849bfa5d50d44eaa6534b.jpg). Extremely simplistic climate controls, small screen flush with the dash.

There's probably a bit of truth to it. Young and optimistic about how much better the world could be, if we'd all just stop being so greedy and selfish.

Then you get older, probably have a family to take care of, care more about how much gets taken out of your paycheck because you've got mouths to feed. Less energy for working and being responsible for things outside of work, so you're less pleased with what gets taken out for taxes.

Certainly not the case for everyone, but.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wouldn't even care about the R35 being a dinosaur if Nissan kept it at the original MSRP of $69,850

I agree that the GT-R's price is quite high nowadays, but you act as if today's GT-R is the same as what came out in 2007.

Originally, it was making 478HP and 434 lb-ft of torque.

This improved to 523HP and 451 lb-ft in 2010/2011.

After that, Nissan squeezed even more out of the VR38DETT and listed the GT-R's specs as 545HP and 463 lb-ft of torque.

And that's strictly just looking at the engine. They also improved the suspension, threw bigger rotors on it, lighter wheels, aerodynamic improvements with the "facelifts" it's received, and they've improved the interior.

Now, is all of that worth the $100K base price Nissan is asking today? I'll let you decide. But yea, the GT-R you buy today and the GT-R you bought in 2007 are **quite** different. 

Edit: It's actually $110K for a base GT-R, now. That is **quite** expensive indeed. But I still stand by the fact that Nissan *has* improved the GT-R quite a lot over it's life.  

Double Edit: Their site actually lists it as 565HP too, so even more than I said above.  I can't think of many cars that have gained a nearly 20% increase in HP for the same generation of the car without significant price changes. </TEXT>

Who is this car marketed towards? People who want a Focus/Fiesta ST but can't drive stick?

<TEXT> I have a shameful amount of hours logged in DOTA 2.

There are a lot of things I dislike about HotS, but I do have fun when I play it. More specifically, I generally have fun *no matter how the game goes*.

I think I have a pretty good understanding of "DOTA Theory", but my actual skills are on a much lower level. And for me, there are few things worse than a shitty, long game of DOTA. 30 minutes in, stomping the other team but no one on your team wants to push your advantage. No one will take high ground. It just drags on another 30 minutes of pussyfooting and you eventually lose. Or one of those games where you're just losing the entire time but, again, the enemy team is also not very good and instead of ending the game they back off, wait for Rosh, farm their next item, then win. Meanwhile all you can do is sit in your base and kill creeps because the other team has covered your entire jungle in vision. I fully admit I'm just as much to blame for a loss as anyone else on my team; that's not my issue. My issues is that I don't want to queue up for a game and have it potentially be an hour long trainwreck.

There's none of that in HOTS. Even when you're losing, because the objectives are so powerful, it's always worth contesting them. You're never stuck just turtling in your base forever. Games are over in 10-20 minutes.

I miss laning in DOTA, the comparatively insane power and long stuns. But I'm just not going to play a game where I can be stuck getting berated by teammates for an hour. </TEXT>

I lost my only brother unexpectedly, five months ago. Not necessarily the same as losing a parent, but certainly shitty in its own right.

My best friend sat up with me all night the day I got that phone call (live far from my family) and went to the store and bought some ingredients to cook me whatever I wanted, try to make me laugh when I wasn't crying, and asking what thoughts and emotions were going through my head when I was.

Everyone grieves in their own way, but I'm very grateful for how he dealt with me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, instead of wasting $1,000 for a short shifter, eBay exhaust and cheap wheels, put that money aside for a Miata or some other cheap, fun car.

You can polish a turd but at the end of the day it's still a turd. I don't mean that a Matrix is a bad car across the board... But it certainly wasn't developed with *spirited driving* in mind, and trying to make it into something it's not will cost *at least* a couple hundred dollars bare minimum. And it won't be much more fun at all.

Just do the standard maintenance things you'd do for *any* car and bank what you can for a base vehicle worth dumping some money into, if you want better performance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm inclined to agree that they're a little static, especially at this point. But that's not to say I don't enjoy them.

A few things:

* I think Matt is simply a charismatic person and enjoy listening to him. If schmee tried to do these, I'd never watch them.
* I really like seeing some of the insane projects people work on, such as that widebody 2JZ BMW, the Coyote Cayman, and that SEMA-prepped Veloster
* Some of the guests can be very interesting. The recent Honda Insight video is a great example. I always thought the Insight was sort of cool, like it had lot of elements of an almost really cool car. Then you actually look at it and say, "nope" -- but the car owner knew a ton about the car, about the batteries, and even though it's not something I'd ever buy I still like learning / seeing people who are into their car
* Vehicles I'll never even *see* in person let alone drive or own, such as last week's DB11 video
* Also interesting to see Matt's opinion of any given car. I have a tremendously limited list of vehicles I've driven, and of those cars less than half of them are cars anyone is interested in.

I'm definitely much much less interested in his videos for new "average" cars, though. For example, I didn't watch this week's Camaro SS video. I've never been into Camaros so I simply don't care. It's a 2017 so I assume it's stock, or close to -- even further lessening my interest.    </TEXT>

Use the clippers to neaten up the beard. The slightly damp paper towels in the sink will catch and hold on to most of this. Then just pick up the towel and throw it in the trash.

I only 'actually' shave my neck, and at this point there's nothing left but the tiniest of stuble which is easy enough to just wet another paper towel or a few squares of TP and rub around in the sink to pick it all up. Or just wash it down, but that might be bad for the plumbing. </TEXT>

Long story short I had a FWB thing with a girl who didn't like to give head, and told me she didn't much care for receiving it either. So we'd just make out, get handsy, then bone.

Her poorly kept hair downtown didn't bother me much because there wasn't the expectation I'd be up to my nose in it.

If the girl did like/want oral, then maintenance would be **far** more important.

My personal preference is for it being smooth down there, but that's not a deal breaker. </TEXT>

That is one of the most successful series of games **of all time**, and according to Wikipedia is the single most successful FPS series.

With annual releases and a heavy MP-focused game it also has the benefit of "social sales". People buy it because their friends buy it and they want to play together.

<TEXT> You can get a decent Japanese sedan for $3-5K easily on Craigslist. I assume laws vary by state so you'll have to do your own homework on buying used vehicles through a private sale. Chances have it, you (the buyer) will have very few 'protections'. I sold a car off CL though, it was tremendously easy. $3K for a Corolla with 135K miles, I was getting emails not 15 minutes after posting it. Agreed to sell it to one guy, he showed up with a wad of Hundreds, we both signed the Title, took the plates off and he drove home with the title.

---

Any old Corolla or Civic is fine really. Obviously lower miles is better, but ultimately those cars will run forever.

The most unfortunate part of this is that you absolutely should get it looked over by a mechanic. I want to say this is referred to as a "third party inspection" or TPI, but I could be mistaken. It's early and I'm not awake yet.

This will cost you $50-100, which is a lot, especially for someone in your position but it sounds like you cannot risk buying something and find out it's got some massive issues and die not long after.

But yea, you don't need a $10K+ car. Something half that price should be perfectly adequate.

I'm not sure what /u/PvtPyle05 is referring to by "driving services", were you looking to become an Uber/Lyft driver or something?       </TEXT>

<TEXT> Y'know how Time Warner and Charter just merged into a single ISP? That's good for both.

The ISPs like it because it's less competition.

It's also good for Trump because once they repeal more Net Neutrality fundamentals then they have fewer ISPs to deal with to inject date into your web traffic. Trump / Russia could then theoretically just push fake news into your web traffic to support whatever assinine claim he wants to make. It's one fewer ISP to deal with in the courts to get user data.

I know that's full on 1984 shit, but the fact is it's a dangerously powerful tool that needs tremendous oversight.

The President who has flat out referred to "First Amendment people" as "foolish". Now they're ceasing to publish the White House visitors. He clearly thinks information and the internet is an enemy, and by giving ISPs whatever they want he puts himself in a better position when he needs a favor from them. </TEXT>

Sure it visually looks dated, but in part due to the visual design choice to support the theme and narrative. I wish more people would play this over swooning ME:A, BattleFront II, or other recent titles.  

Like I said man, I only watched him play for an hour. It looked like typical hack n slash gameplay.

<TEXT> The only thing that bugs me about IT is no overtime pay.

The last time the laws were updated, in the US, was in 1996 when they made it so that "salary employees earning at least $455wk or $27.63/hr are exempt from overtime laws."

If you're wondering how they came up with that $27.63, they tweaked the law from how it was introduced in 1990*. Back then it said you must earn at least [min. wage]  6.5. When they adjusted the law, they set it at [1996's min. wage]  6.5. As for the $455/wk figure, they tripled the old value of $150/wk which was some arbitrary value established in the 70's.

So it pisses me off that the wage laws are 21 years old.

\*: "Computer Employees" were added to the overtime exemption list in 1990, the laws governing these requirements were first introduced long before then. </TEXT>

But I agree, Porsche naming conventions are terrible. If I pull up their website right now and click on "911 Models", you get this page:

911 Carrera has 8 options.

911 Targa has 2 options.

911 Turbo has 4 options.

911 GTS has 5.

Then there's also the 911 GT3 and 911 R listed, too.

That's **21** different 911 Somethings which all look quite similar. In addition to that, I think "Carrera", "Targa", and "GT*" are all extremely ambiguous. The only 911 sub-brand which which implies "additional performance" based off the name would be "Turbo", in my opinion.

I love Porsche and I'd love to own a 911 one day, but fuck trying to figure out which one.

And then once you do, you get to go through the dozens of individual options for your vehicle. </TEXT>

American muscle cars have decades of culture in the US that Nissan simply can't match. Like yea, the Z has a pretty strong community but it's not even remotely close.

I know people who like Camaros and Mustangs because their dad had one growing up. They not really "into cars" very much but still like driving something fun. These aren't potential customers Nissan is losing out on by not offering a cheaper option; these are people who are going to buy that specific car regardless.

I just looked up the Mustang's price and the V6 is actually *cheaper* than the ecoboost -- so even if Nissan did go this route and offer an I4 turbo / NA V6 it's not going to be much cheaper, if at all. So yea... </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The bill, which received general approval last December, tackles the main issues head-on by granting copying permission in some circumstances and by flat-out banning the use of DRM when the public should have right of access to a copyrighted work.

 In a boost to educators, citizens will be given the right to circumvent DRM for teaching and scientific research purposes. There will also be an exception for private copying.

 The Dridex Trojan infected computers through a malicious Microsoft Office document, typically disguised as an invoice and emailed to victims.

 The malware **relied on tricking people into installing it** on their machines, **rather than exploiting a security hole in the operating system**.

Compared to today's article:

 When recipients open the document, the exploit  if successful  is used to carry out a series of actions that lead to the installation ofDridexbotnetID 7500 on the user's system.

Sounds like it's an overall different attack vector. 2015 sounds like the user is opening legit_file.doc.exe where as today they're opening an actual .doc which contains links to a dangerous, outside source. </TEXT>

I've found that dotnet devs tend to be terrible at javascript and most javascript devs are bad too. linting saves lives.

Heh. So I actually work for a medical company. When they were just getting started in the 80's / 90's they outsourced the development for their Windows desktop application to an Indian firm. Eventually paid them to rewrite it as a web application and purchased the source code so they could hire some devs in house to maintain / improve it over the years. It was recently re-written *again* using more recent technologies / frameworks.

So yeaaa... Definitely lots of *quality* code here.

I'll have to look at one of those JS analyzers. I just spent 2 months using a static analyser for the .NET stuff, didn't even occur to me that there might be a similar tool for JS. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would assume it ultimately comes down to budget.

It's probably not worth the cost to cover much more than the main WRC teams. They can only afford so many cameras, air time on TV, and editors for producing their "Daily Highlight" videos.

Speaking for myself, I usually tune out when they cover the WRC 2 stuff. The teams themselves get little time in front of the camera so I don't care who wins or loses. I'm not sure if I could even name 3 separate drivers from that bracket.

Personally, I would **not** be interested in Daily Highlight videos doubling from 25 minutes to 50 minutes due to the addition of thorough WRC2 coverage **if** this caused the WRC+ subscription price to increase. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm currently going through and cleaning up my company's flagship project. Most of the C# isn't *too* bad but I've moved on to the JavaScript and there's been some real head scratchers.

One thing I've noticed is missing semicolons in many places, which I've corrected. I looked up why this doesn't blow up, assuming it was up to modern browsers' JS engines to fix this. Turns out JS has a feature called [automatic semicolon insertion](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2846298). Which is something I strongly dislike the entire concept of.

However, it seemed a little "hypocritical" of me as I love things like ternary expressions, not encapsulating single-line statements in braces for an IF or a FOR statement, and using var in place of especially long types.

I know a lot of developers dislike at least those last two examples as they can make things harder to read / less standardized / less explicit.

Just made me wonder what are some features, particularly of .NET, that you don't take advantage of due to personal preference? </TEXT>

<TEXT> * US employees too expensive?
* foreign employees underpaid? 
* failed US educational system?

I'd say it's a combination of these 3. Probably in order from Most Significant to Least Significant in terms of how we got into this situation.

 Employers view IT as a necessary evil. An unrelenting, all consuming pit of money and they don't want to spend a dime more than they have to. So they don't want to pay the high wages American IT workers demand. ^*. I used to work for an international US Bank. Located in the States, on my office I worked on a team with 4 other individuals. 2 Indians over here on an H1B, a woman who held dual citizenship, and a guy who might have been a US citizen but I'm not sure. Anyways, in my physical office, I was the only one *from* the US. My team consisted of the 5 of us and 10 others in a different state. 10/10 on my other team were all here on H1B's. And I can guarantee you the work we were doing wasn't exceptionally demanding -- not in the "We can't find qualified American workers" sense that is often used as a reason to justify needing H1B's.

Couple that with being able to import cheap laborers who have very few, if any, rights and suddenly you've got a very desirable thing. You hire these people on work visas and either they pull their weight and don't ask for anything, or they suck and you cut their visa and send them packing. What are they going to? Sue for improper termination? Fat chance.

And as you said, our education system. I don't have "IT grad numbers" off the top of my head, but it's only getting more and more expensive to go to school. I, foolishly, went to an over priced private school. It's actually worked out pretty well for me, but I honest-to-god tutored some of the goddamn **dumbest** fucking kids. When I was getting my Bachelor's the IT chair asked me to tutor the Associate level students 10-20 hours per week. I had this one kid who was one semester from graduating who couldn't write a comment. He couldn't do anything. I spoke to the chair about my concern and he was wholly indifferent. I spoke with one of the student's professors and he basically acknowledged the kid was a moron, but if he passed his assignments and quizzes, well, what can you do.

But yea I do believe there's an attitude of, "We don't care about your education so long as you keep writing those tuition checks" in this country. Certainly in a lot of private colleges, but I wouldn't be surprised if many public colleges behave the same way. A friend of mine initially earned a BS in Business Management because he didn't know what he wanted to do in life. We were talking about it the other day and he mentioned how that program was, by a large margin, the largest program at this major state college churning out thousands of these degrees. Talk about market saturation...
 
---

^* Fun Fact: I recently did some research about labor laws. I knew I was ineligible to earn Over Time working as a programmer but I wanted to learn the specifics.

 Section 13(a)(1) and Section 13(a)(17) of the FLSA (Fair Labor Standards Act) provide an exemption from both Minimum Wage and Overtime Pay for programmers, analysts, engineers, and other similarly skilled workers in the computer field who meet certain tests regarding their job duties and who are paid **at least $455 per week on a salary basis or paid on an hourly basis at a rate not less than $27.63 an hour.**

I pulled that from a PDF on the Department of Labor's website that I pulled up on my PC. Trying to pull it up on my phone but it just automatically downloads the document so I can't link it but simply googling "DOL computer overtime" should yield it.

Anyways, in 1990, "Computer Employees" were added to the overtime exemption list of they made at least 6 times more than minimum wage. 

In 1996 the law was changed to 6 times what the minimum wage was in 1996. And the law hasn't been changed since then.

The laws dictating whether or not I am entitled to getting paid for the amount of work I do is so old that it could legally buy a beer ^^^if ^^^you ^^^could ^^^find ^^^somewhere ^^^which ^^^serves ^^^alcohol ^^^to ^^^legislation.       </TEXT>

I'm not saying it's impossible to find work, but I feel bad for anyone graduating without having an internship or pet project on GitHub or anything in addition to your expensive piece of paper.

I don't mean to sound all "doom and gloom" but IT is a very competitive field. What school you went to, what your GPA was doesn't mean much to most employers. You need to be able to demonstrate you can actually get shit done.

Start talking to your professors or TA's if you can. Meet people. Get involved. Find projects. Do things.

I went on at least 5 interviews while getting my degree because my professors passed my resume off to someone they knew. I didn't get a job that way, but at least I got interview experience. Full disclosure, I went to an overpriced school with very small class sizes (5-20 people) so in class it was very easy to talk with and get to know your professors. I assume you went to a more traditional school with big lecture halls where the professor doesn't know anyone's name.   </TEXT>

Given that you were already disinterested in the brand, I'd assume you're not going to research them too thoroughly on your own... But that's your decision.

There is little stopping most car buyers from doing their homework before buying a new, or 'gently used' cars.


I guess I'm just jaded because I'm in my 20's and owe more in student loans than I make in a year *before tax*. I just googled "car sales commission" and the first article I found suggests:

  "Typical commissions range from 20-30% of the profit. So if a car sells for $1,000 over Invoice the sales person would get $250 on a 25% commission"

So for someone like me, that's a lot of money. Especially factoring in, again, the fact that 3/3 of the salesmen I've purchased from played zero role in my decision to buy the car.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is that due to a lack of dealerships, or due to the fact that they're a company that only **really** started producing cars in the past decade?

The Roadster is like 15 years old now but the Model S has sold approximately 160K cars since its inception in 2012, according to Wikipedia.

By contrast, Toyota sold approximately **360K** Corollas in the US in 2015 (also from Wikipedia)

In one year, they've sold over twice as many vehicles as Tesla has in half of a decade.

They have a lot of money, but they are still a young company working to ramp up production numbers.

Not to mention they use... Well it's more common now, but I think you could still call it unconventional technology. So that's going to make it even harder to deal with.


In any case, maybe they do provide a valuable service in those regards but I was referring strictly to the sale/purchase of vehicles.   </TEXT>

I'm sure there are some people who buy sub-200K cars who make, at most, $500K. To these kinds of people a 20K difference is a lot.

Not everyone who buys one will be some filthy rich car baron. 

No idea how much money my boss and his wife make but they have a Z4, X5, and he got rid of his 911 for an i8. The Porsche was just too expensive, he said. </TEXT>

The fuck? When I was selling my 350Z I had no issues driving ST's. Went to two or three different dealers trying to find the right one.

I test drove a Focus ST at one dealership and the dude was like, "Here's the key, come back in 30. I'm finishing up with a customer right now."

Ended up coming back to that same dealer 6 months later for a Fiesta ST; same exact thing. "Here's the keys, see you in a bit".

Good call.

Nissan hasn't said a peep about a 370Z successor. There's a COMPLETELY UNSUBSTANTIATED [rumor of a successor at this year's Tokyo Motor Show](http://blog.caranddriver.com/nissan-z-concept-coming-production-car-could-reach-500-horsepower/), but again:

* Nissan hasn't said a word
* That is a blog post article which doesn't cite a source
* The rendering is from someone unaffiliated with Nissan
* Any other article reporting this just cites this shitty C D blog as their source

So yea... You'd be waiting like at least until 2020 honestly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sort of, but I think the bigger problem is that it *starts* at a few thousand dollars over the Camaro, Mustang, Challenger, and Genesis Coupe.

Each car is a little better than its competitors in all of their own ways, but ultimately the Z doesn't bring much to command a higher price. Especially considering that the Base trim doesn't even include an LSD so really you should be looking at Sport trims or better -- only further raising the price.

So between being more expensive than American 2-doors, and the fact the today's generation just doesn't have the *income* for a $30K+ performance vehicle that is overall fairly average... who are they trying to sell it to? Like don't get me wrong, I'm a giant Z fanboy and I'd buy one if I had the cash, but I fully understand why many don't / won't.

Another thing is that the 370Z tries too much to be a GT car; comfy leather seats, nice (seemingly) interior with decent materials and such. It's fairly heavy (though again, lighter than the American options)... But then what's the point of the G35/G37? Those are simply a more comfy, more luxurious Z. Sooo why don't we strip out a few hundred pounds worth of luxury shit in the Z, make it a nice proper lightweight sports car and then have the comfy G series for those who want that. </TEXT>

If you're not into Z's / Nissan, I can absolutely understand how they might look damn near identical. Especially when you're actually driving and see one.


Major differences are Nissan's atrocious "hook" headlights design on the 370Z, though strangely I prefer the 370Z's taillights. Hood and bumper are a bit more aggressive, but again if you're super into Z's / driving, it's quite hard to discern. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think that's a fair comparison.

The interiors are certainly *styled* in an almost identical manner, but  the quality did go up between the 350Z and its later generations, as well as the changes brought on by the 370Z. The 350Z's cubby hole door was some shitty hard plastic thing. Looks like it's a nice soft leather in the 370Z?

I can't say whether the interior is up to par for a vehicle that *starts* at $30K, but I mean you can get a used one for a reasonable price and it's really not that bad.


That said, I think the 370Z's steering wheel is ugly and the gauge cluster on the dashboard is ugly. I get it, it's an iconic thing with the series but I remember thinking it was quite worthless and missing key features in my '03 Z. From what I hear of the 370Z, they're really not making much better use of it. But hey at least one of them can display the fucking clock now.

I wish the climate controls + radio would switch places with the cubby hole above it, but then where would they stuff the intotainment crap. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There was a discussion thread on here earlier this week or maybe last week talking about the same thing.

"Open World Fatigue", you could call it.

When you have the freedom to go anywhere and do anything in any order, and have a mini map chalk full of Points of Interest, it can ruin the narrative / feeling. Nothing is important. Everything can wait.

I recently purchased Grandia 2 on the PC, which I've never played before and I've been really surprised at how much I'm enjoying it. You don't sit through countless tutorial popups. You don't get bombarded with countless things to do. You just do your job, explore cool maps and fight shit. It's well paced and just generally a breath of fresh air from "modern game design philosophy". Don't get me wrong, I do wish certain modern-day features were in G2 but for a game that first came it in 2000 it's held up very well.

That said, I think the issue is ultimately a player-controllable problem. Pick a quest and stick to it. Don't get side tracked talking to every mook in every village. Get an objective, see it through, and come back.

Of course this isn't a perfect solution. Sometimes it just doesn't make good sense to skip something in the same area, or maybe stopping to do this one other thing first will get you a helpful item. These are certainly valid complaints, and I'm not entirely sure how to address them from the perspective of "open world gaming".

I think in general a lot of people are starting to get tied of every game being an open world with a million side quests and points of interest. It can be a mile wide but only a foot deep. While this can describe many games, obviously some do it better than others but in either case I think the only "real" solution is simply for a shift in the way games are made.

After playing Grandia 2 these past few weeks I'm definitely looking for more turn based RPGs that are less "modern" in that you just buy the game and you get a game. No dealing with N different game library managers. The main menu doesn't need to fetch DLC advertisements. Multiplayer isn't shoehorned in because everything needs multiplayer. The tutorial is minimal and optional.

That last part is honestly one of the biggest things that annoys me about modern games. So many games assume you're a brain-dead vegetable who has never played a video game before. Like I get it, some tutorial is a good thing and some games do tutorials very well. But when it's telling me to use W or the D-Pad or the Joystick to move forward and look around I groan every time. And then you open up the menu and holy shit you get 100 tooltips explaining every single UI element and entire mechanics. </TEXT>

I don't have especially long legs and have sit a little closer to the wheel than my arm's would necessarily like, but if I move back then it is uncomfortable to fully depress the clutch so I just end up sitting too close.

How fast were you able to get the Fiesta up to?

I've done one real track day in a 350Z, prior to any autocross experience. It was a lot of fun, but rather intimidating barreling down a straight at 130 and then slamming the brakes just before entering a very hard corner.

The one and only autocross event was in the Fiesta. Much more fun, for me. Maybe if I had a lot more autocross time I'd have enjoyed the track more.

I'd be a little wary of the Fiesta overheating, or melting its brakes as you found.

 Koni Yellows (the fronds are red because they were the prototype shocks) no leaks. Fronts also revalved for stiffer rebound (I forget the rate)

<TEXT> One recently opened up in my town but it's insanely expensive; $100 for a 'lane'.

It says it a lane can fit up to 6 people, but I don't know that many people willing to go throw axes; so really it'd be like $30-50 per person which is a lot for only 1 hour.

Edit: Rather, I don't mind spending *up to* that much for a fun night out, but chances have it you're going to be terrible. And at $30 an hour, I'm not going to be able to do it with any frequency. </TEXT>

They're a great "I just graduated and can't afford a $15-20K+ car" car. 

Like you can get a nice Touring trim for that cheap; heated leather seats, possible navigation if you want it (I preferred one without). So it's pretty comfy for the price, too.

There's plenty of cars that are faster for the same (or less), or lighter ones, or better in some other metric -- but they're still solid fun. I miss mine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can get them in AWD, but you lose the manual transmission if you do.

Honestly I considered one when I was looking to replace my 350Z.

But it's over priced and not as fun.

IMO the issue with the Juke is that the AWD trim offers nothing over a WRX. It's more expensive, fewer doors, and looks worse.

FWD only, not as fun as the Fiesta and also still more expensive.

The ground clearance would be nice (I live in the snowy North East) but honestly I live in the city and most of my driving is highway so it doesn't really make the much of a difference if it's got 3" of clearance or 10". Either it's a blizzard and I'm not going anywhere, or its been plowed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Modern safety standards require cars to:

 The newest (2009) rule says that vehicles weighing 6,000 pounds or less must be able to withstand a force equal to three times their weight applied alternately to the left and right sides of the roof. The roof cannot bend so far that it would touch the head of a median-height-male test dummy.

Which is quite impressive.

That said,

 Experts agree that to withstand the forces of a real rollover, roofs should support about four times the vehicle weight, not three times their weight as the new rule specifies.

 Safety belts are not required to hold occupants in place during a rollover. As cars roll, occupants are pulled out of their seats and toward the roof. Most safety belts in use today won't stop that.

So while modern safety standards have come a long way... damn, that surprises me. </TEXT>

When was the last time you've tried to use EA help?

I bought Battlefield 1 the first weekend of the month, on Friday. Installed it Saturday, played for a bit, and requested a refund. I haven't heard a peep from them. **Every single link** on their website 404's. I can see that I've got a Pending Refund on the "My Cases" page, and "Refund Requested" on my Order History page and that is it.

Trying to use Chat just says, "Please wait while chat loads" forever. Any link 404's. They don't have a phone number **anywhere**, and I **still** haven't gotten my refund, almost a month later.

Steam you click refund and the game is out of your library and money returned next day.

<TEXT> This makes me really excited.

I'm a hardcore DOTA fan, although I just took my first step towards sobriety and uninstalled it after playing since TI2.

I tried out HOTS, and while there are a lot of things I miss from DOTA, I will say Blizzard did a solid job of taking an original take on a saturated genre. One thing I didn't like though was just how brutal it took to level up and get skins; and I sure as hell wasn't going to pay *that* price. So -- at the time -- I just went back to logging a shameful amount of hours on DOTA.

Applying the "Overwatch Model", I'm kinda thinking of going and installing this right now. Me and old friend were just talking about looking for something to play together, and while I do kinda miss DOTA, or wish HOTS had some of those things I like more about DOTA, I don't want to deal with the 50 minute games, getting shit stomped, just wishing it would **end**. The only thing worse than losing a bad game of DOTA is getting kicked in the balls for an equal amount of time.

I think I'm going to go play me some ~~Crystal Maiden~~ Jaina Proudmoore right now. As the top-post says, I wish all the heroes were free but oh well; this is better than nothing.

Edit: Is this like a smoker substituting cigarettes with candies or some other "hand held snack"? </TEXT>

Specifically this line*:

 It was a way to associate an ad with a users page without putting it directly on the page, which advertisers worried would imply an association between their brand and the pages content. Specifically, we came up with it when a major car company freaked out that theyd bought a banner ad on a page that celebrated anal sex. I wrote the code to launch the window and run an ad in it.

<TEXT> Is that the Scale75 model? How was it?

This thing is beautifully painted by the way. How'd you do the skin tone? I've been working on trying to step up my painting and every time I'm always disappointed with how the skin always comes out.
I try usually mixing Vallejo's "Pale Flesh" and either a gray or a brown depending on what I'm painting, a light brown wash, and then try to highlight... But it always comes out 1 of 2 ways:

* Too thick
* Too thin and splotchy

In either case, the wash often doesn't look great either.

I can never get a good middle ground between the two paint: thinner ratio, or perhaps basing gray is a problem? </TEXT>

<TITLE> How to deal with a player who often gets off topic? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-25 03:54:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been playing with this one group for about a year now, maybe less. 7-12 months I'd say.

Overall it's a good group, we all get along but I only know 1 of them particularly well (the DM). Something that's been really bothering me recently though is that the player who hosts gets off topic all the fucking time.

We're usually there for 3, maybe 4 hours and it seems like maybe an hour, hour and a half of that is *actually* playing D D.

The rest of the time is him segueing story after story after story that was vaguely related to something that just happened. Sometimes they're amusing, half the time they're about some obscure movie or game system none of us have ever played. But then he gets off topic and eventually someone else has another story to share and it just feeds off him.

Me and the DM try to get things back on rails, but I'm not necessarily the best "leader"; I might interrupt when there's a very brief lull in his stories but I can't always keep the train on the rails. The DM tries, but it's also not a guarantee of any sort that we'll actually start playing once one of us tries to get shit going again.

The issue is that he *is* actually a really nice dude... He's just a fucking oblivious conversation dominator and I guess we're all too nice and don't want to interrupt so we quietly nod a little bit until there's a good opportunity. I don't really know how to bring this up though because it's his house. I don't get the sense that he "likes to hear himself talk" or anything like that. I have nothing against him. It's just that I'm here to play a game and I'd like to actually play the game.

Any suggestions / dealt with similar behavior? </TEXT>

Basically, because rally racing is performed over the span of *hundreds* of miles it's impossible for the drivers to memorize every turn for every stage. So they have a person sit in the passenger seat ("codriver") who actually reads off these pacenotes, which instruct the driver of things like:

* Upcoming turns and their severity
* Water hazards
* Jumps / crests

The Model S is definitely quick, but it's not really marketed as a driver's car or a performance car. They want to appeal to everyone, and therefore they give it a nice big open space.

<TEXT> I'm almost done with book 4 and I get what you mean. But it's not just the women; both sexes do it.

All of the girls are constantly, "Men! What a bunch of insufferable idiots". All the men are like, "Every woman is the most confusing person".

I get the whole, "Men and women are different, there are male and female halves of the one power" but it does definitely get  tiring when so many of the characters subscribe to similar ideals about the opposite sex.

I haven't been interested in a single romantic arc between Perrin, Rand, or Nynaeve and so far really wish "love" wasn't part of it.

Elayne loves Rand despite barely knowing him. Nynaeve loves Lan, an emotionless silent stone. Rand doesn't know who he loves despite barely knowing any of the "contestants".

The only relationship that seems remotely "real" is Perrin and Faile because they have actually spent a lot of time together and helped one another. </TEXT>

I picked up WoT because Sanderson has really gotten me into reading.

I'm *almost* done with Book #4 and I just don't think I can do it anymore. 5 and 6 are almost as long. I feel like I've gotten tiny scraps of a reward for having made it this far.

There's so many things I do like about the series; it's just that for every 5 pages I enjoy, I have to get through 150 pages which do very little for me. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [The Shadow Rising] Almost finished, not sure I'm going to read the next book. Can you guys convince me? (Long post / a little ranty) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-24 18:56:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm on chapter 51 of The Shadow Rising. 8 Chapters to go, but right now I'm thinking I'm not going to finish the series.

Book 1 was a bit slow, but introduced enough to get me interested.

Book 2 was much more enjoyable and laid some ground work for all of our characters. I think this was my favorite.

Book 3 was like a mix of 1 and 2, I thought. A bit slow, and while a good amount happened at the same time I feel like not enough happened. Or at least, I was hoping for a little bit more individual development. But there were enough chapters that left me saying, "Fuck that was cool I need more".

Book 4 has just been SO slow. The only reason I'm closed to finished with it is because I had to spend 15 hours in a car the other weekend and was able to get through 20 chapters while listening to the audio book (normally I actually read).

The past few chapters Jordan had laid some serious groundwork. [Perrin spoilers](/s "letting the White Cloaks into town after defending against the Trollocs"). [White Tower spoilers](/s  "Elaida leading an insurrection -- probably the most interesting plot point to me, especially factoring that Moraine is completely unaware"). [Rand spoilers](/s "I just do don't care about the Aiel. All of these chapters are just Rand and Avienda yelling at each other. I get that they're setting up for all the clan chiefs to come and shit's going to go down but I'm just so not interested in their culture, and Rand is still using 'not a tenth of what he's capable of'"). [Elayne and Nynaeve spoilers](/s "Another set of characters where I just want to see some growth but so little is happening. We've been hunting the Black Ajah for how long and there's nothing to show for it, except for a recent brush with another Forsaken who mysteriously mind controlled the girls and made some comments about how weak they are").

I also get really annoyed with a few things regarding the Forsaken. [Lanfear](/s "It annoys how she just pops up at her whim"). [Moghedien](/s "Similarly, her just showing up out of the blue and mind controlling Elayne and Nynaeve really bothered me. It's just like, 'Oh OK well I guess that's a thing you can do. Or maybe only her, fuck if I know"). The Aiel eluded to the Soulless coming next and I'm not even a little excited because I already don't know Jack about the "current lineup of bad guys".

I want to get into the series, especially now that I've invested ~3-4 months of reading. But fuck. Half the protagonists resent everything happening to them, and the other half has not progressed very much. During some of the recent Rand chapters I've had the thought of, "This series seems almost more about just different cultures of people than anything else."

Which is fine, there's nothing wrong with that, it's just not my thing. I don't find the Tinkers interesting. I don't care about Aiel ways and the *proper way* to ask for permission to enter a person's home.

I *do* find the one power interesting. I do find tel'aran'rhiod interesting. I do find... Whatever you'd call Perrin's ability interesting. But after 3,000 pages of reading I just feel like I've gotten so very little reward out of it. Really struggling to want to read them, knowing books 4-6 are the longest 3 of the series.


Without spoiling much, can you guys give me an idea as to what book 5 holds? Will it get more into the story elements I do find interesting? I'm afraid that Jordan has established the "bottom of the ocean" already and that the intrigue of the book is more cultural/political and grounded in character growth as *people* rather than exploring the magic and things like that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> i5-6500, GTX 970 and 8GB of DDR4, I had very few issues playing at 25601440.

Only time I did was on my Loud playthrough, and even then lagspikes / frame drop wasn't consistently an issue for me. Sometimes it would dip briefly when I first got a dude with lots of NPCs on the screen but it would quickly resume to a playable state.

On my quiet / low chaos, stealthy playthrough I had zero issues ever.

So in my personal experience, I wouldn't consider the performance issues to be significant enough to not buy the game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see your point but you need to realize internet is not a necessity.

Despite being a programmer by trade, someone who grew up from a very young age using the internet as a daily part of my life, and just generally being a tech enthusiast, I do agree that it's not a necessity.

But I also think that the internet is one of the single greatest things mankind has built. You can learn almost anything. It is the largest collection of damn-near the collective knowledge of the world. It is a tremendously powerful tool regardless of what your using it for, whether it be personal or professional. It has absolutely revolutionized way the world interacts, learns, and generally behaves.

I don't think it's a matter of necessity or not. I simply think it's wrong to allow a select few to indiscriminately track and sell damn near everything I do.

As I edited my post to say, software companies already do this but there's a lot you can do to control what gets tracked. With something like this, though, all bets are off. </TEXT>

You get the point but the more weird/random the better. Basically anything to throw off their attempt to profile you.  

Just generate a random website which pulls random articles from Wikipedia, then make a browser plugin repeated hit that address at certain intervals? Lol.

But even still, storage is cheap and it's all through their lines. So that wouldn't even really do much. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love it:

 The Senate measure was**introduced two weeks agoby Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and 23 Republican co-sponsors. Flake said at the time that he is trying to "protect consumers from overreaching Internet regulation."**

Yes, protect us from not having our personal data sold. While we're at it why don't we protect us from HIPA too and start selling our medical data.

 FCC Chairman Ajit Pai argues thatconsumers would be confused if there are different privacy rules for ISPs than for online companies like Google and Facebook. **"American consumers should not have to be lawyers or engineers to figure out if their information is protected," Pai recentlytold Democratic lawmakers.**

Yes; now you can all sleep soundly knowing your information is being sold. 

Edit: To everyone already saying, "But Google/Facebook already sell your data!!"

You can change search providers. Lots of people don't even have a Facebook account. For me, I don't use their apps and I only use it for chat to coordinate with my D D groups.

If you think the two are the same then you should seriously consider the differences between the two. You can install browser plugins to mitigate tracking and use different sites, browsers, and devices.

You have some modicum of control.

In most of this country, you have 1 choice for an internet provider. So it doesn't matter what you do or where you go; it's going to them first. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a '14 Fiesta ST.

It's absolutely manageable, but anyone who says it isn't there is lying.

I wouldn't say it's bad, definitely easy to correct, but I can feel it in first and second if I floor it. Third... I don't often floor it in third, and if I have recently I can't recall weather / tire temperatures so it might be unfair to say.

Full disclosure; I only have All Seasons for not-winter, and Winter tires. I'm looking to get a set of actual Summer tires this year which I'm sure will help but I don't believe it'll still remove the problem.

Also, as others have said, the factory rear motor mount is absolute dogshit in the Fiesta; the engine seriously moves. That definitely doesn't help. Short comparison video of stock vs aftermarket; https://youtu.be/SfQUrLCX-MM </TEXT>

<TEXT> I literally fucked up my Ubuntu install trying to update my video drivers recently.

I just upgraded to 2x 25601440 monitors and was having a lot of issues with the default device drivers. Found some tutorial online for the Nvidia drivers; followed the steps, rebooted, then when I would try to log in my screen would flash random colors and dump me back to the login screen.

It was a relatively new Linux install, after trying to fix it over the course of the week I said fuck it and reformatted the disk from my Windows partition (was dual booting across 2 physically different disks). Rebooted again and now Windows wouldn't boot because the MBR was fucked.

Eventually fish out my Windows disc and repaired that, but fuck what a goddamn headache.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't disagree, but from what I understand "street legal" is actually not an exceptionally difficult obstacle overcome.

 Most requirements for automobiles are consistent between U.S. states. A notable exception is California emission control, which has traditionally been more strict than that in other states. Common requirements for automobiles include structure (examples: hood) and safety equipment (examples: headlamps and bumpers)

- [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street-legal_vehicle)

It's really just lights, directionals, seatbelts. Stuff like that.

Which all adds weight, and every pound matters at this obscene level of performance. But overall, it's pretty easy to meet those requirements.


Edit; Found this link on Google: http://blogs.lawyers.com/2011/01/what-makes-a-car-street-legal/

Again, most of this stuff just adds weight. Sound restrictions probably vary by state, but I've honestly never heard of anyone getting ticketed for such a thing.

So it's really not too difficult to build an obscene car that you could still legally drive on the street. As I said, for this bleeding-edge performance of course every pound matters, but you could get very close to it without sacrificing these requirements. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The way I see it, Google at least does stuff with my data.

What has MS done to improve their product by harvesting my data?

Google Suggested Search Queries are crazy accurate a lot of the time. Google Maps traffic updates are **awesome**. Notifications on my phone providing info about an upcoming flight is handy. Swype / Gboard is nice because you don't get the same physical feedback from an actual keyboard so texting is more error prone which they can work to correct.

What the fuck is MS doing with my data? I don't use Bing, or their maps platform. I don't use Skype, or OneDrive. I don't use Office on my home PC. I don't have an issue typing on a physical keyboard.

I'm OK with companies tracking data if I get something out of it. I'm not OK with companies tracking my data just because they can. Not all companies are equal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here are just a few things I found quickly glossing over her [Wikipedia page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren):


1) In December 2012, Warren was assigned a seat on the Senate Banking Committee, the committee that oversees the implementation of DoddFrank and other regulation of the banking industry.

2) In May 2013, Warren introduced the Bank on Student Loans Fairness Act, which would allow students to take out government education loans at the same rate that banks pay to borrow from the federal government, 0.75%

3) During the 2014 election cycle, Warren was a top Democratic fundraiser. Following the election, Warren was appointed to become the first-ever Strategic Adviser of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee

4) July 2015 Senator Warren, along with John McCain (R-AZ), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), and Angus King (I-ME) re-introduced the 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act, a modern version of the Banking Act of 1933. The legislation is intended to reduce the risk for the American taxpayer in the financial system and decrease the likelihood of future financial crises.

5) December 2016, Warren gained a seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, termed by The Boston Globe to be "a high-profile perch on one of the chambers most powerful committees"  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think those are all fair complaints.

I think from a mechanics / game stand point, it's superior to D3 in almost every way. But D3 does one thing better: production.

Everything **sounds** good in D3. Even early skills have a nice, bassy rumble to them. Things just "feel" powerful. Input is very smooth.

It's been a long standing complaint that melee is a little wonky in PoE. Combined with the fact that most of their income goes towards development of features rather than things like audio, visual, cinematics or voice overs -- it is easy to lose interest. Especially if you're playing alone.

And by playing alone, I mean without separate voice chat and friends. I actually enjoy the game less in a party with randoms.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll admit I think D3 handles difficulty very well. It's easy to get a character to cap after you've been forced to play through regularly, once.

But PoE 3.0 will contain 10 Acts that you play through once.

I'm not hardcore into the game so maybe GGG has detailed things better, but I **think** the time to reach end game will probably still be the same, it's just that no longer need to slog through the same game three times over per character. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> (**Edit:** Yea you guys must be right about it having been the Oculus Rift -- but I wouldn't buy an OR anyways)

I got to play this game "Cranga" - it's just Giant Jenga - for like 10 minutes at PAX East this weekend. It was very simple but I was absolutely blown away by the experience. It completely surpassed my expectations in terms of:

* The headset was very comfortable and lightweight.
* I had no issues with the refresh rate of the displays or anything visually.
* The tracking for the hands felt perfect.

I'm not sure what VR headset I was using. The controllers didn't look like the Vive's, but I just googled [Playstation VR](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstation-vr/?emcid=pa-pe-97928) and the headset didn't look like that. Also, I think I saw two little cameras on stands that I assume we're to help with tracking my physical movements, but I don't think the Vive has anything like that, does it?

Unfortunately it was so busy at PAX I didn't really have time to investigate, and English was the developer's second language so I was having a tough time understanding him when I tried to ask a few questions.

1) I thought I read on this sub that people who have had LASIK eye surgery have had issues with VR. I didn't notice any problems but I wasn't playing a "serious" game, nor did I play very long. So for those here had who have had LASIK, how has VR been for you?

2) Would this year be a good year to buy a Vive? My parents asked if I wanted one for Christmas after telling them about it, but I was wondering if a completely Wireless version was in the near future.

3) Accessories! 

- Is the "Link Box" actually as important as its [product description](https://www.vive.com/us/accessory/link-box/) makes it sound?

- What is the nose rest? I'm guessing it goes over the lower half of your face and helps disperse weight that would mainly be supported by your nose?

4) Finally, how often do you guys use yours / what do you use it for? I imagine I'd like to use it for watching videos, light gaming, and I periodically tinker around with game development (Unity, mostly). </TEXT>

This is a concern regardless of the weather. You can be the best, safest driver in the world and still have some jerkoff crash into you.

I live in a state which got ~7 feet of snow from a single storm a few years ago. Admittedly, that was a rather extreme case, but the point is we're certainly no strangers to snowfall.

There are zero laws relating to tires or anything like that. Almost everyone I know follows the, "I've got AWD I'm fine even though I'm driving on OEM All Seasons. No I don't know how many miles are on them, why do you ask?" ideology.

<TEXT> ... but in its current form, what you get is simply a Diablo-type game with streamlined loot - you get items that enhance your builds in very specific ways, rather than being given items that are nothing more than bundle of random stats like in most other action RPG games.

Blizzard has done a better job of creating interesting Legendary Effects that make the gear more impactful for Builds, but it wasn't always that way. Vanilla gear was terrible, and even early RoS it was mediocre at best.

One of my issues is is that it's impossible to gear up an Alt like this, because everything you find will suck for that other character unless they use the same stat.

Now OK, I know you can get to level cap **extremely** easily so ultimately that doesn't matter, but I still don't like it. As you said, "within the context of the game it works" but that's what I'm saying: I dislike and disagree with the core fundamentals of D3.

Because some of those Legendaries are so powerful, you don't want to give up their special abilities shoehorning you into keeping it until it drops again but better.

 The issue you're talking about in regards to getting the same items with better rolls only comes up when you still want to keep playing after investing a lot of time on a specific character, which is honestly something you couldn't even do in other Diablo games since the difficulty stopped at Hell.

If by "other Diablo games" you're specifically referring to D1 and D2, sure. But again we're comparing a series that started in 1996 with the most recent base game coming out **16** years later. 12 years after D2, which is really considered to have defined the genre. In that case, I don't think it's fair to flatly compare games that came out more than a decade apart from each other. Gaming and game design has changed significantly in that much time.

But in D2 specifically, I'd disagree. Between runewords, crafting, and trading it wasn't as simple as "I hope this Random Mob in this Rift / this Rift Boss drops a better version of what I already have"

If by "other Diablo games", you mean other "Diablo-like games", I can't comment much here as I never played many "Diablo clones" other than Torchlight and PoE. Naturally all of these types of games will eventually boil down to "The only upgrades I can get are better-rolled versions of what I have", but I think D3 hits this wall very quickly. Certainly more quickly than PoE. I never got very far in Torchlight or Titan Quest to comment on those. Didn't play Grim Dawn or a lot of the others.

Then of course you have all the various difficulty levels, the set dungeon challenges and the upcoming rift challenges which are designed to keep you busy after having played hundreds of hours. And seeing as how the game didn't originally have 13 levels of Torment difficulty, I'm pretty sure Blizzard didn't expect people to want to play the game for that long. 

Given that D2 still has a healthy population, I don't know why Blizzard would think this. I don't have the game installed to check bnet but last I knew when you log in it tells you how many active players there are. But a quick Google search shows threads on various forums from 2016 discussing playing the game, so I'd wager it is still active. I'll admit the Set Dungeons we kind of cool but I don't know much about the Rift Challenges.

 Basically, the reason why they're about to release a new Ancient version of the legendaries we already have is because people are still interested in playing the game even to this day, which sort of proves that the game isn't in fact broken since nobody in their right mind would play a broken game for that long.

OK? If people enjoy the game, great. Good for them. Let them enjoy it. They can disagree with me, and I can disagree with them. That doesn't mean either person is right or wrong, it just means that D3 isn't the game I wanted it to be. And given that a game by Blizzard, one of the most successful studios in all of gaming, has a whopping ~50 total upvotes on this sub shows that a lot of people also agree that it's not the game they wanted. Again, neither is right or wrong, it's just not what *I* hoped it would be.

Furthermore, that doesn't change the fact that Ancients++ are just plain **lazy**. I think even those who enjoy D3 in its current state would agree.

With that being said, little clarification: you can trade with other players in your games, and you are not guaranteed to get your class's main stats on your items either. 

Sure, but trading is more like "Well I don't want/need it so here you can have this". It's nothing like what trading was in D2. And don't get me wrong: trading in D2 is far from great. Trading in Path of Exile, which is very similar to D2, is widely agreed upon to be the worst part of the game.

And the chances of it not rolling your stat is GREATLY less likely than it is to roll yours. So, OK, definitively you're not **guaranteed**, but it's a miniscule chance that it may as well be.


At the end of the day, I just see all these new and interesting content patches PoE releases multiple times per year, I can't help but shake my head when Blizzard announces "Same Gear, Better Stats".  </TEXT>

It's a double edged sword for sure.

<TEXT> Almost as if D2 was from a completely different era of gaming, one might think.

My issue isn't the lack of content. It's that D3 is **fundamentally** a broken game.

Online-only for absolutely no reason, given you can't trade with other players. The game is a giant Loot Pinata, with loot guaranteed to roll your class main stat, which is a standard formula for the damage for Everything. Set Items which make specific combinations of skills distinctly better than coning up with a build on your own -- at least until you start getting Ancient items. Or Super Ancient items or whatever the fuck they're called. In either case, it's loot you've already seen before just with higher stat rolls.

Wow. Such excite. Much creativity. </TEXT>

Game hands you loot. No trading. Gear automatically rolls the stats your class needs. And I loathe the "All damage is based off your weapon + main stat" formula. Challenges hand your a free Set for the "Blizzard Build of the Month".

It's just a fundamentally un-interesting game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's the thing though.

In highschool -- for me at least -- English class consisted of reading Shakespeare and a dozen other novels I liked almost none of, and writing papers about symbolism and themes in them.

Most of the classes had very little focus on any form of "real" communication.

It doesn't teach you to debate, there was very little focus on actual linguistics. It was just reading, papers, and spelling quizzes.

And now that I think about it, I think writing **so many** papers could arguably be a bad thing. They teach you to spend so much time on them, needs to be X pages long, and learn to write a Bibliography.

I now write massive emails, proof read it twice, format it all fancy before hitting send and then no one reads it because it's so long.

Meanwhile my boss writes extremely brief emails, and *his* boss often writes like I typed when I was 11.

I've started going back and trimming out a ton of fat and superfluous details because more often than not these "nice, detailed" emails just confuse people and then they call me and ask me to explain. </TEXT>

Yea, we should definitely plan our school curriculum around the miniscule chance someone will "make it" in the performance / entertainment / arts sector.


I get your point; not every class you take is going to be relevant to every career choice. But at that point, what about chemistry, or physics, or calculus, or a foreign language? School is full of classes that aren't relevant to a lot of things in the real world. You know how many times I've **ever** needed to speak Spanish? Zero. Exactly zero times.

<TEXT> I live in the North East, had 2 paid internships in college ($10hr and $15hr), one of which turned into a full time job upon graduation.

Since graduating, I have never once had an issue finding jobs to apply for or getting contacted by recruiters. And usually getting at least one interview.

Interviewed with at least a dozen companies between two states in New England, and went on at least 5 interviews since moving to New York.

I've got 4.5 years of experience *now*, but when I moved here I had about 2 years of experience, if you include my time as a intern.

I absolutely would not count myself as a "hot ticket". I had a shit GPA.

I sincerely think that people who say there aren't enough IT jobs are geographically limiting themselves and therefore can't find a job.

Like OK I get it, not everyone can just uproot and move to another state for a job. But also a lot of people **can**, they simply won't.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The computer science and IT industry is over-saturated and becoming increasingly outsourced.   

Whether they are or not isn't especially important, I think. There's a good chance that if you have any sort of office job, you could automate a good amount of shit you do if you knew how to.

For example, today I'm writing a little script which parses data from one file, then searches for all instances of that data in hundreds of other files. It's not just a simple "Search for X" though as I've had to add a lot of other parameters based on the data's "proximity" to certain things which indicate if I actually care about that instance of the data being used or not.

Admittedly, I *am* a programmer but I think the general idea of what I'm doing could apply to someone working in any department.

Shit, our Accounting department still runs on sneakernet. One of the women there **manually calculates** everyone's available Vacation / Sick time, and for some reason it's always a month or two out of date by the time she sends them. I just got an email today "As of Jan 25th your available time is..."

Fuck that. I wrote a script to loop over every Excel file in my "Timesheets" folder. Multiply [Number of Files] by [Number of hours accrued per pay period] and then subtract [Sum of all cells in all sheets which contain the Vacation code]. Boom. Instant, On Demand totals.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  All their games are wimpering when it comes to streams, vods, and official trailers. 

I mean, what do they have?

Infinity Blade, an iOS game. The most recent of which came out 3-4 years ago.

Gears of War seems like their most popular series of all time. I assume it's more successful financially/player numbers than Unreal just because gaming is overall more popular than Unreal was during it's own "hay day". Either way, GoW's latest entry was also 3-4 years ago.

Paragon... Wikipedia says it hit Early Access last year, and then Open Beta later that year. So I don't think it's entirely fair to judge an unfinished product. That said, free to play "multiplayer battle arena" games are **so** over saturated. If late 2000's / early 2010's were full of MMO's wanting a slice of the WoW pie, "MOBAs" are definitely the same thing the past 5 years or so. Just another game on the pile of titles wanting that LoL/DOTA money. I don't mean to say it's a bad game; I haven't even played it. Just that the genre is too crowded and people aren't willing to get invested in a similar title.

And then that leaves us with Unreal Tournament. I'm quite excited for UT, but honestly I don't even know if I'll *actually* play it all that much. It's mostly just nostalgia at this point as I enjoyed Unreal Gold and a few of the UT games as a kid. But I'm just not into competitive multiplayer nearly as much as I used to be, and I don't know how much of a market there truly will be. I commend them for making what seems to be a pretty "true to its original" reincarnation, and I hope it succeeds, but we will see. Last time I installed it though it still seemed quite early on its development. I don't think there were many "completed" maps.


So... Across the board I don't see how any of their recent works would attract much attention on twitch, in the news, or wherever else. </TEXT>

All that was said is that there will be 3 performance cars, and that the GT86 should be lighter than its competition.

That's it.

It was purely the journalist who wrote the article that brought up the MR2.

As I linked in another comment, Jalopnik has reported nothing more "three cars coming soon" and only said it **seems like** an MR2 successor could be one of them.

Not that I hold Jalopnik in particularly high regard, but the point is no one from Toyota has said a fucking thing about the MR2 or a mid engined production car in the near future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Per [this Arstechnica article](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/02/fcc-lets-billion-dollar-isps-hide-fees-and-data-caps-democrat-says/?comments=1 post=32880173)

 By setting the threshold at 250,000 subscribers and exempting small ISPs owned by larger companies, the FCC is effectively "exempt[ing] billion-dollar public companies" from rules that can be complied with in mere hours each year, said Mignon Clyburn, the FCC's only Democrat.

So I'm a lot less OK with it than one might be at first thought.

Edit: And as far as the rules they no longer have to follow:

 The enhanced transparency rules expand upon rules first implemented in 2010. To comply with the enhanced rules, home Internet providers and cellular carriers must make public disclosures that include the following:

 * Pricethe full monthly service charge. Any promotional rates should be clearly noted as such, specify the duration of the promotional period, and note the full monthly service charge the consumer will incur after the expiration of the promotional period.

 * Other feesall additional one-time and/or recurring fees and/or surcharges the consumer may incur either to initiate, maintain, or discontinue service, including the name, definition, and cost of each additional fee. These may include modem rental fees, installation fees, service charges, and early termination fees, among others.

 * Data caps and allowancesany data caps or allowances that are a part of the plan the consumer is purchasing, as well as the consequences of exceeding the cap or allowance (e.g., additional charges, loss of service for the remainder of the billing cycle).

 The new rules also require ISPs to disclose more information about network performance, including packet loss statistics.

So that's what these "small businesses" will no longer have to report. Which is pretty fucking important information. </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK so let's go over what the journalist said, versus what Toyota said:

 Toyota is set once again to be a major player in the performance car market. Echoing its line-up of 20 years ago, the heart of its sporting range will be **The Three Brothers**, according to legendary Toyota engineer, and Gazoo Racing chief, Tetsuya Tada.

 That means a new Supra, the GT86 taking the place once held by successive generations of Celica, and a spiritual successor to the MR2 in the form of a lightweight sports car. Tada-San expressed Toyotas desire to have the trio in production together **As soon as possible**. With other performance specials like the new Yaris GRNM hot hatch, Toyotas driver-focused offering should soon be unrecognisable from the barren period of recent years.

 The confirmation of a new MR2 is fantastic news for driving enthusiasts, and should at last mean some competition for the Mazda MX5 in the segment.

 ...

 One big reason the GT86 isnt gaining lots more power is the incoming Supra, a car that makes Tada-Sans face light up at the very mention of its name. Telling EVO **The car should be lighter than its rivals**

Everything that is bolded are the actual quotes from Toyota.

Absolutely nothing is in stone. It's the journalist who brought up the MR-2 with passive, vague language like "spiritual successor to" and "lightweight sports car". And then later on goes to quote Toyota while saying how the GT86 is supposed to be lightweight.

Why would they double-dip with two "lightweight sports cars" if the only thing separating the GT86 and the alleged "MR2 Successor" is the engine placement?

Not that they're great either, but [Jalopnik](http://jalopnik.com/toyota-hints-at-new-mr2-and-three-sportscar-lineup-1793108540) wrote:

 This **seems to be** a confirmation that a new MR2 is in the works, and Evo speculates that Toyota will seek to incorporate hybrid technology developed for their LMP1 racecars, and that the MR2 **will likely retain** its traditional mid-engine design. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The large hardware disparity between the Switch and Xbox One/PS4 means that you are much less likely to see current games ported across.

That's not necessarily true though. The entire beauty **of** supporting such a popular like Unreal is that you, the game developer, can configure different build profiles / platforms and publish to multiple at once.

You develop high-fidelity assets to be included when you're building for PC / XB+PS, and then develop less demanding resources to be included for the Switch build of the game.

Yes, surely the hardware limits will still come into play, but it's going to be far easier to develop a game for all 3 consoles than before when you can use a single development environment. </TEXT>

Do you want to have to get out and walk around your car **every single time** you need to get something out of the back?

Like yea, he'll absolutely be talked about for some time. But unless he actually starts WW3 or something along those lines, he can fade into obscurity with all the other Presidents your US History teacher briefly glossed over -- Eventually.

You're right that we'll continue to hear about him for a while even after his term (I really hope he doesn't get a second term holy shit). But unless he **seriously** does something monumental, he'll be a distant memory before long.

The only reason I've heard much about any of the Bush family or Bill Clinton is because their family was running this election. Yea Reagan gets thrown around often and what not, but I dunno; you just make it sound like day in and day out from here until we die it's gonna be Trump, Trump, Trump. </TEXT>

Looks like Ford reps have been quite about whether the ST will indeed make it to the US or not.

How soon do you need a new car? Are you basically looking to trade in your current one before something breaks and renders it worthless?

If that's the case, then I'd just jump into a 2017. The 2018 offers new looks, LED lights, a little bit more power, and different paint options. The 2016 introduced Android Auto / Apple Car Play, and IMO that's the "major feature" separating the pre-16's with anything after it. Nothing in the 2018 model seems *exceptionally* worth waiting for. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not advocating it, I'm just making the counter argument that just because some might download something, it doesn't necessarily have a real world, tangible net loss for Nintendo.

See here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_sales

 However, other scholars and free culture and copyleft activists argue that the industry figures are grossly inflated, because some **individuals who obtain pirated copies would not have purchased the content, even if the opportunity for piracy did not exist.**

Consider this hypothetical situation: Someone lives in a country where Nintendo does not conduct business. You cannot buy Nintendo products anywhere.

If a person who lives in this country downloads this emulator along with a copy of the game, then Nintendo has not lost a sale because this person couldn't buy it even if they wanted to. </TEXT>

Per the FAQ link:

 Q: Where is game save data stored?


 A: On Nintendo Switch, game save data is stored on the consoles System Memory. This will not change whether downloadable software or software from a game card is being played.

<TEXT> From what I hear of Japan, there's so much infrastructure and mass transit it's great.

Take the train / subway to work. Perfect. Throw it in your laptop bag and play. Or as you said, flying? Great.

But for someone like me in the Western world who drives to and from work... Portability doesn't mean shit.

It's too big to carry around with me to play while waiting in the doctor's office or things like that. So for someone like me I have to say, what's the point? Because now it's just a really fancy, unique, weak livingroom console.

I haven't followed the console very closely. Do we know yet if it's supposed to "replace" the 3DS? Will they be making 3DS-only games still? One of my biggest gripes with that thing is the low-resolution text literally hurts my eyes, and the ergonomics is just not right for my hands. Get cramped up before long.

If everything that would be on the 3DS will be on the Switch, and I can play it un-docked with the Pro controller I might be interested once the price comes down. I'm not spending $300 on the console and $70 on a controller. </TEXT>

<TEXT> * 1) Dont invest in the car, drive it to 80k miles, sell it.

I'd do this. I kind of feel like a decade+ old Toyota is going to be worth little no matter what. Or at least, the difference won't be significant.

* 2) Invest in the car (tints, replace stock radio with touch screen, replace hubcaps with rims, replace interior seating), and sell at 80k miles.

I would probably replace the head unit so you can get something with Bluetooth or at least an aux port, but tinted windows and wheels on a Camry? It's your car, do whatever you want.. but if you know you're scrapping it before long I think this is a foolish idea.

* 3) Invest in the car (same as above), and sell NOW at 40k miles.

Alternatively you could take the money all the "upgrades" would cost and light it on fire. Modding your car decreases the value. Period.

Nobody wants your modded ecobox.

* 4) Sell the car as is at 40k miles, buy something nicer potentially with more mileage.

Up to you. Like I said, you could probably sell it with 40K on the clock for $4K.. or sell it with 80K for $3K... An early 2000's Toyota is exactly what it is, and no one is going to pay much more money for it just because it has low miles. Toyota will last forever: would spend $6K on a newer model with more features, or $6K on a lower mileage one with less features? Of course you'd do the former -- you're talking about getting rid of it already because it's a Camry lol.

Background: I am a college student graduating this year with a focus on paying off reasonably manageable student loans. Thank you for any advice in advance, I appreciate any advice anyone more savvy can provide.

Yea definitely #1 then. Fuck getting a new car, dude. Drive it and enjoy not having a car payment. Throw the money the would be your car payment at your student loans and get rid of them faster.

I don't mean to sound like a dick, a Camry is a fine car [for its target demographic] but.. yea at the end of the day you're just talking about polishing a turd. Either drive it or get rid of it.

<TEXT> ... they take to mods extremely well. 

It depends on what you're doing.

Suspension mods will do a ton for the car, absolutely. And sway bars are cheap as hell.

But if you're looking for power gains, fuck no. The VQ engines breath so well from the factory. A plenum spacer, intake, and exhaust (along with a tune) will get you like 20-30HP.

Assuming you didn't cheap out and buy a shitty eBay exhaust, you're probably looking at close to $3K for less than a 10% increase.

The only way to get any additional power is to go forced induction. In which case you're looking at $5K for a single turbo kit or supercharger, or $7-10K for a twin turbo setup.

I'm not certain about the 370Z but the general recommendation for the 350Z is to reinforce the internals if you're looking to go above 400WHP. I assume the 370Z probably doesn't have much higher of a threshold.

I'm a huge Z fanboy, I love the looks, think it sounds great. I'd happily buy a brand new Nismo 370Z if I had $40K that I absolutely needed to get rid of... But they definitely have their limitations.  </TEXT>

That's thing it: It's really not.

V6 Mustang 0-60 in 5.3,  mile in ~13.5

V6 Camaro - 5.1   ~13.5

370Z - 5.1   ~13.0


I'm on mobile so I'm not going to bother looking up skid pad stats or stopping distance, but I know the numbers are out there -- I've looked it all up before. I think Car and Driver has all those specs. But yea; in every single metric it's either better than, or only marginally worse than, the other V6 American offerings.

I understand there is a lot more to a car then just stats pulled off zeroto60times.com --  they all have their own personalities when driving them. But at the end of the day, you're really not going to notice much of a difference. Especially when you consider that 99% of drivers never autocross / track their cars.

So yea, it's definitely a 'Jack of all trades' car and I 100% don't blame anyone for wishing it was lighter. It just irks me when people act like it's total trash because it does everything well but nothing great. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let's see...

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_elections_by_popular_vote_margin#List), 62,979,636 people voted in the general election for Trump. For simplicity's sake, let's just call it an even 63M.

Trump Wall costs according to...

[Trump](https://youtu.be/vU8dCYocuyI?t=108) himself: $4B

[Trump again](https://youtu.be/vU8dCYocuyI?t=135): $6-7B, 8, 10, maybe 12, depending.

[Paul Ryan](http://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/trump-border-wall-to-cost-dollar216-billion-take-35-years-to-build-internal-report/ar-AAmNQtl): $15B (further down in that same article, it cites [Bernstein Research](https://www.bernsteinresearch.com) as estimating up to $25B)

[Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-border-wall-cost_us_589cf9d9e4b0ab2d2b13ae7b): $21.6B

So we've got quite a range of numbers. I realize both Trump/Ryan as well as MSN/HuffPo are *probably* going to be biased, so I tried to provide a variety of sources... Anyways...

$4B / 63M people = $63.49/per

$12B / 63M = $190.48

$15B / 63M = $238.10

$21.6B / 63M = $342.85

$25B / 63M = $396.82



Maaaaybe at the $63.49 tier he could get 63M backers on kickstarter :P

Though I guess he could just offer multiple tiers for more wealthy donors.

<TEXT>  The truth is that there is a huge portion of Americans who prefer to have economic freedom with their healthcare choices.

I think this is the fundamental difference that makes people come to a point where they need to agree to disagree.

The way I see it, it has nothing to do with 'economics'.  I just it's **bizarre** we live in a world where I could live my whole life working a job, paying taxes, being a "productive member of society" -- then hypothetically my employer goes out of business. I lose my health insurance. Driving to a job interview, I get involved in a hit-and-run... And then what? I spent my whole life 'doing what I should', not getting in trouble etc. and that's just the way the cookie crumbles? Tough shit?

I think the sheer concept of being OK with a society like this is insane. "Sorry fucko, shouldn't have gotten into an accident."? We have **more** than enough wealth in this country. Yes, my example was hypothetical but it could absolutely happen. </TEXT>

I've definitely heard people say it doesn't handle as well as you might expect / want -- I know /u/thesmokingtire isn't a huge fan. But honestly, I think it's plenty capable. Are there cars that corner better? Of course. Are there cars that are more nimble? No doubt. Are there cars that are faster in a straight line? Absolutely.

But it still does all of them pretty well. And in my opinion, looks a hell of a lot better than the comparably-priced Mustang/Camaro/Challenger which all make similar power (if you're not looking at the V8's, anyways) while being lighter than all of them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm quite interested in the Cobb package for my Fiesta, but I don't get these "full blown" project ST's Matt has done. There's this one and that ~~['big turbo' Fiesta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLDRXiSO7vE)~~ wait no, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXFmDtf42Sw).

For this Focus... I don't "get" sinking *that* much money and effort into a FWD hatchback. He only uses it for autocross / track use, so whatever. But that Fiesta? The Fiesta rocks because all the power comes on so early; it's very easy to have fun in. What he's done, you need to be all the way up near the limiter for the turbo to get spooled up. What the fuck is the point.


To each their own, but I sincerely do not understand. As I said, I'd like the Cobb package for a little mower power / a lot more torque but that's about it. At the end of the day it's still a FWD ecohatch with some factory Go Fast parts, so it just doesn't seem worthwhile to spend any more than that.

**Edit** maybe it was a different Fiesta video? I could've sworn I remembered Matt liking this one a lot less but clearly I'm mistaken... Was only half paying attention though

Double edit: Yea I updated the link. "My peak power's at about 7500... You wanna shift around 72", he says. To me, wtf is the point of that in the Fiesta? </TEXT>

Go Best Buy and bought some new RAM, swapped it out, same result.

I start looking into it more and find out that a few generations ago, Intel got rid of the northbridge and included the memory controller directly in the processor. So it's either the motherboard (bad memory DIMMs) or the CPU (damaged pins).

List of crime committed by specific subgroup of a tiny population: ???

What I don't understand is this: Your problem is people are here illegally, correct? So what do crime statistics matter? Whether their only crime is that they snuck into the US or not, you want them out, correct? I'm not saying that's unreasonable, no one likes the concept of their tax money supporting people who aren't paying into the system. **However** I do not see how this list will accomplish/improve anything.

For someone who rambled on about cutting taxes and trimming the budget, you know what I see? Pointless regulation that will only cost money.

So, yes, he literally said to go and publish a weekly list of crimes committed by illegals.

One day I didn't have the hat on and swung by the store, the cashier was like, "Hey you're not wearing your Monster hat!"

Like, even the red from the sunset in the painting is roughly nose height. And the blue container things in the photo are also right about level with his nose (from a 2D perspective)

Very different *colors*, but the raw "framing" is definitely there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really don't think it's necessary at all.

My two internships I had in college were through my school's Employment Office. One turned into a full time job.

My second job I found through a staffing agency, as well as my current job.

LinkedIn has done two things for me:

* [Leaked my data](http://www.csoonline.com/article/3086942/security/linkedin-data-breach-blamed-for-multiple-secondary-compromises.html).
* Cluttered my inbox with notifications from jerkoff recruiters who didn't read my profile but think I might be an excellent match for this great opportunity they have. 

I would never use 'regular' social media sites like FB, Twitter, Instagram etc. for professional purposes, unless I owned my own business and was using the company page for some reason. 

In that case I can see the argument, but then it's really just marketing   PR, not "social networking". </TEXT>

Unless you really want a roadster, I wouldn't do it personally.

Yes 10K miles is effectively a brand new car, but the Z has proven itself to be a very reliable sports car even at 100-150K and beyond.

Unless you aim to keep the car for a very long time (in which case, the extremely low mileage **is** a huge boon) I'd rather buy something with higher miles but get '06 or newer. I just found an '07 Touring with 78K miles on it for $12K on ebay. Even though I said it is a very reliable car, I'd look for something with closer to 50K than 80K but you get my point.

I'd say sit, save up more money, and find a newer model for a similar price. Z's are only getting cheaper. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't looked in a long time, so maybe I'm wrong, but to my understanding is that CF hoods are barely lighter than stock so it doesn't make a ton of sense to replace *just* that.

Like for your average autocross driver, would you rather spend $500 and save a couple of pounds, or spend $500 on tires/suspension mods?

Its weight savings becomes significant the more you spend... But for one single thing like that, it's kind of pointless. Only reason not to just get an imitation one is simply to say, "Yes, it's real carbon fiber."

For professional racing teams, it's worthwhile because that's not going to be only weight-saving change, so when you add up all those reductions it becomes significant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not trying to be a dick, but I realize it's expensive today.

The entire pretense of my question is under the guise of it becoming an affordable material, which is why I linked / mentioned the article.

The question is simply:  Does CF behave in a similar enough manner to current materials that we **could** see a world where cars are primarily made out of CF (once the price is worked out), or is its "conditional strength" such that it's not optimal to largely (if not entirely) replace steel/aluminum in current vehicles.  </TEXT>

I would argue that each individual collision / "instance of abuse" is most likely far worse for a race car than your daily driver, yes. But these race cars have the budgets of major corporations behind them to fully repair it, no questions asked, after each race.

If you get rear ended in a hypothetical carbon fiber Corolla, have it repaired (based on insurance pay out) and then you get t-boned in the same region but from a different angle... Then how does it hold up?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The advantage of carbon fibre is that it is extremely strong and light. Meaning that if you could produce it cheaper and put it into more cars, you can achieve great gains.

That's what I'm talking about though. Hypothetically, say CF can be produced at a cost that would make it viable to replace current materials. Is it safe enough for "daily driven, road-going use" that's going to see hundreds of thousands of miles of driving and be subjected to the abuse every Joe Schmoe's DD is subjected to.


Your input on dent/scratch/shatter is interesting though; I hadn't factored repair costs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was reading [this article](http://techau.com.au/mass-production-of-carbon-fibre-solved-by-csiro-and-deakin-costs-set-to-crash/) (which is now no longer loading for me...). Basically a group of scientists/engineers in Australia claim to have invented a "scalable" way to produce carbon fiber, dramatically reducing the cost to produce it.

Now, to my limited understanding, carbon fiber is extremely strong *in one direction*, based on how it's weaved. So for its current usage in things like motorsports or very high-end performance cars,  this isn't as big of deal because:

1) Motorsports have other existing safety regulations (roll cages, Hans device etc)

2) Performance vehicles which currently make extensive use *generally* don't rack up too many miles / aren't bought for their safety ratings

Given its "conditional strength" from weave, is CF actually safe to replace steal / aluminum with for autobody construction for every-day cars that will be the sole means of transportation for millions of drivers? Are they actually safe when considering the wide array of crash test requirements a vehicle must conform to? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Usha Ram says her manager gave her permission to take home the food.

 Her boss, Janif Mohammed, fired her to warn other staff against theft.

 Mr Mohammed, who defended himself, says Ms Ram was an exemplary employee, a "wonderful lady" and a "good worker". The two had worked together since 1989.

What a fuckin' dick.


 At the time of her dismissal, in January 2014, she was earning $21,000 a year and working full-time. Her husband is physically disabled and she also supports an adult daughter with a mental disability. She is the sole earner in her household.

 The judge ordered the franchise co-owners, Mr Mohammed and Michael Lacombe, to pay her $21,000 in general damages, or the equivalent of one-year severance. The judge also awarded her $25,000 in aggravated damages for emotional distress.

Often times, I find these "emotional damage" payments to be excessive and terribly prone to manipulation... But this woman's situation, I really feel bad for her. I do believe she thought she believed she has permission for what she did. Then to be fired for it, while supporting her husband and disabled daughter... That's gotta be stressful. I was a mess when I got laid off and only had to worry about student loans / myself. </TEXT>

My 31 year old brother unexpectedly passed away in November. It'll be 4 months exactly, tomorrow. I can still remember every single detail about receiving the phone call. Flying home. Going to the funeral. Every little detail like it just happened a minute ago.

It sucks, but it does get easier to bear.

I'd strongly recommend talking to a professional. Grief counselors are a thing. It's helped my parents a bit. I've already been seeing a psychologist for other issues, but she's been very helpful with this too. Her husband also unexpectedly died a few months before my brother, actually...

Everyone dies. It's a natural part of life. It sucks, but sooner or later it happens. All you can do is try to make peace with that fact. Make peace with the fact that you can't understand it, won't understand it. You might have a lot of questions that you'll never get the answers to. It's those things you need to learn to control, so they don't get the best of you.

Sorry for your loss. A sibling isn't the same as a SO, but I can understand what you're going through. I imagine it's  awful in different ways, but yea...     </TEXT>

You don't need to look that far back, though. You could go back 5-7 years and find high mileage Hyundai that will be reliable.

And besides, they still do their 10 year / 100K warranty. Even if the car isn't **the most reliable**, you're covered. Sure as shit beats the 3 year / 36K on my 2014 Ford.
 

I'm on mobile so I can't figure out how to link search results but if you simply go to /r/Hyundai and search for "reliability" you get plenty of threads. I see posts of people taking about '05 SUV's with 200K miles where they've had to do nothing but standard maintenance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ... it would be much better to buy a European electric car or a Tesla rather than this substandard GM vehicle.

Don't get me wrong, I'm as much of a Musk fanboy as many redditors are, but what are you even saying?

Have you looked at the [Model X problems](https://www.google.com/search?q=model+x+quality+issues oq=model+x+quality+issues gs_l=mobile-heirloom-serp.12...0.0.1.7222.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c..34.mobile-heirloom-serp..7.6.1062.lYYUkZEXQLo)? Car starts at $86K (USD) and goes up to $116K and the trim on the body doesn't even line up. That is substandard for a $20K car, never mind something that costs more than most people's annual pre-tax income.

Like let's not pretend Tesla is perfect. They have their problems. As do the Germans.

So, not only is the Model 3 not even out yet, but if you can afford the $42K for an i3 you're getting a car with a 100+change mile range, or 180 of you buy the hybrid. That is substandard.

VW doesn't have anything fully Electric on the market last I knew, but even if they did I personally don't like them -- especially not after "Dieselgate". And I'm pretty sure Audi and Merc don't have anything all electric, either.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been playing an Eldritch Knight this season in Adventures League. I'm having *fun*, but the class seems objectively terrible. I'm really **not** a "min maxer", so I could just be playing it poorly but my issues are primarily:

* Needing STR, INT and wanting CON, you're spread thin on stats.
* Restricted to Evocation and Abjuration spells
* Gaining higher level spell slots so slowly

It's a fun, flavorful class, but I get the feeling that if I tried hard enough, I could probably just multi class between a caster and a melee class and be equally effective, or probably even more effective.

I read through the Hexblade PDF earlier this morning and... Wow.

* Use CHA instead of STR or DEX, minimizing "desirable" stats.
* Improved Crit
* Bonus Damage
* Healing

I realize those last 3 are only against your Cursed target, but only requiring a Short rest between uses isn't a steep requirement for how good it is.

Level 10 there's just a 50% chance to evade **any** Attack Roll by the cursed target!? Not just melee -- spells and ranged attacks too.

Then at 14 you can daisy chain your curse freely.

And this is all on top of what you get just for being a Warlock.

---

It just all sounds so fun and I want to be playing that right now. EK is just like... Neat I'm 7th level and now I can cast 2 second level spells from an extremely limited spell list. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [The Dragon Reborn] Just finished #3 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-15 15:36:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 85% of the way through this book I was thinking, "Pretty good but I think I enjoyed #2 more."

Just finished that last 15% and **damn** that was a great ending.

Mat is the best. I really love this "Dark One's Luck" thing and I can't wait to see how Jordan utilizes it in books to come.  Not sure what to make of Mat's comment to Thom when he left him with Mother Guenna. I *think* I accidentally [spoiled](/s "Mat dying and coming back, so I assume his comment was foreshadowing his own death"). But with my shitty memory maybe whatever I glimpsed was talking about a different character... Or so I'm trying to convince myself  But I laughed so hard when he killed the first High Lord in the Stone and then raised his staff triumphantly, accidentally felling another High Lord behind him. I can picture the scene perfectly.

Egwene's developments as a Dreamer is going to be awesome. I know this whole time Moraine / the Amrylin was saying how Egwene and Nynaeve have the potential to be some of the strongest Aes Sedai but damn. "Tying" up and shielding one of the Black in Tel'aran'rhiod in her dream was cool.

Nynaeve's a fucking badass too but I can't even remember what she did earlier in the book that made me think so. Did she weave up some Balefire? I can't remember, and Book 2   3 are blurring together for me. Her interaction with Mother Guenna in Tear was thoroughly amusing. That said, her persistent "Fuck the Aes Sedai and Moraine for everything they've done to me/us Two Rivers folk" still annoys me. I don't care if she is/could be Aes Sedai Numero Uno -- maybe she could've helped Egwene, but I don't believe she could've done fuck all for Rand. And besides, The Wheel weaves as The Wheel wills. It's not Moraine's fault, you woolheaded sack of vegetables.

I'm not sure what I think of Perrin. I don't dislike him, he's understandably apprehensive of this whole Wolf thing. It's just that with Hopper warning him, his "uncomfortableness" with his eyes changing, his enjoyment of the Blacksmithing work he did in Tear -- everything -- I have no idea what to expect out of him. Him saving Faile was rad, though.

Rand is a badass. Callandor is awesome. His fight with Baalzamon, or whoever it was, was badass. The sword itself almost reminds me of a Shardblade from The Stormlight Archive, except way more fucking powerful because it's a sa'angreal and not just a badass magic sword. I think I should've seen that coming, but eh I suck at predicting things in books. It was a cool surprise, to me. One thing I didn't quite get is why the seal was unbroken this time. RAFO, I suppose!  My only concern, this book we barely saw Rand. What glimpses we did get he was often going on about being afraid of hurting those around him. I'm afraid he's going to become a "distant" character because oh the whole "I could kill everybody" thing... But surely he's too important to be left on the edges of the focus.

Also, I just love Loial. He's just so... happy-go-lucky. Like he knows shit's dangerous, but he just has this certain confidence to him that things are going to work out, that he's not going to throw in the towel and return to his Stedding. Not without sufficient material for his book!  I can't help but picture the Ogier like some sort of cross between Aslan, the lion from Chronicles of Narnia, and the Khajit from The Elder Scrolls. Like I've seen fan art of the Ogier and I know that description is way off, but just the way Jordan describes his "mane" and "tufts of hair", a very deep voice and a splitting smile and huge tea-cup sized eyes... I just picture a walking, talking humanoid Lion. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-02-10 14:24:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was just reading an article on /r/technology about a new proposal by the Department of Homeland Security. What they're suggesting is that international tourists would have to surrender the passwords to their social media accounts in order to gain entrance to the US.

I'm -- obviously -- not a lawyer, but my understanding of the 5th Amendment and self-incrimination is that a US citizen cannot be made to give up the PIN to a combination lock, or a password to an account. You **can** be made to surrender a key to a physical lock, but not made to give up knowledge basically.

So **if** this DOHS proposal were to hypothetically be applied to US citizens traveling from state to state, this would be a huge violation of our 5th Amendment rights, right?

This made me wonder about the legal rights of tourists visiting the US. Are they granted to same freedoms and protections a citizen are granted? If so, when does the visitor come under the protection of the Constitution? I assume not until DOHS / Border Protection / Whoever says, "OK welcome to the US"?

Note; /r/legaladvice told me to post here instead. </TEXT>

I just hit 100 last night, rest of my party is 40-70 or so. I'm slowly accumulating Felonies. I've got maybe 30 on Adell. Try to throw a stack of dudes into the gate when I can, but it feels sort of pointless because I know eventually I'm just going to recreate almost my entire party once I unlock the higher tiers of characters. Should I only focus on Adell / Rozalin until they're able to carry everyone?

I've mostly been working on unlocking the classes, as soon as I do I delete my current and create a new one then just level them via bonus gauge EXP.

I've also been using a Fist weapon on Adell. I like the displacement effect from Triple Strike as I can punch a guy off the Dimensional Gate in Item World if needed, but I don't like the mixed stats and overall I think that Swords just have better skills. But at this point I don't want to switch.

What about Healers? I was "taught" to give them Bows in Disgaea 1, but this time I've been experimenting with Staves and I like it way more. I can level up via Healing, Bonus Gauge EXP, or just participating in Team Attacks. I see no reason to use a Bow when the Staff will let me cast from further away. Plus I can have the Healer create a Mage and teach the Healer to cast offensive spells this way instead of plinking dudes with arrows.

Are any of the Named characters worthwhile? Adell and Rozalin are my two best, backed by an array of Skulls (though in hindsight I wish I went with Mages instead). I was thinking about leveling Pram and Plenair and a few others who have "S" or "A" tier Weapon Proficiency. I figure it's probably better to have character skills in addition to the weapon skills, no?

Any tips regarding Felonies? I've mostly been throwing the Baliffs onto items I want to level; Imperial Seals and their higher tiers, weapons etc. Should I just get a Legendary low-level item and blitz through it instead, Gency'ing out to slap a new Baliff onto it once I've cleared the current one?

Lastly, I see I can petition the Assembly for Cave of Ordeals. Is this identical to the COO from Disgaea 1? I remember there was a single stage with a 33 group of enemies. I can't tell you how many times I Winged Slayer'd that map, grinding Laharl for hours as a kid. I hurt unlocked The Big Bang, I think it is, which also has a 33 attack pattern. But only a 27% chance to pass the COO bill, at best. Don't want to waste my time trying to bribe the bill through if it's not as ludicrous as it was in Disgaea 1.

**Edit** Oh! Also, what effects a Miss chance? It seems like my Skulls miss their spells way more than I remember in D1. It's so frustrating. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I'm trying to integrate a PHP application into my ASP.NET one </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-02 21:11:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My company's flagship product is an ASP.NET web application which uses MVC 4 and is hooked up to a MS SQL database.

We currently use some tremendously old PHP web forum software as a means off providing customer support, and it's my job to replace.

The current software has two major issues:

* Requires a very old version of PHP, so it's running on a Windows 2003 server which we want to scrap.
* Currently, anyone can find it and create an account and spam the forums.

I've been looking into using phpBB. But I'm having a lot of issues wrapping my head around something that I know *is* possible, I just have no clue how/where to begin.

We'd like it so that once the user logs in to our main application then clicks the Forum link, they'll automatically be logged in there. Fortunately, phpBB does support MS SQL but the password hashing it uses is different than what we use so I'm a little unclear on how this might work. Ignoring that, I'm not sure what is the best/safest way to achieve this sort of "shared authentication":

Session variable? Assuming the new forum will be running on the same server as the main application (currently not the case).

Use a "common" cookie on the client machine for the two applications? Is that safe?

Simply pass their credentials as part of the POST data to be parsed by the forum software?


I've never had to do anything like this, haven't worked with PHP in over 5 years (and even then it was in college), and would still consider myself *relatively* new to web development. The majority of my experience is with desktop applications.

Just hoping anyone here might have any advice or worked on something similar. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [The Dragon Reborn] A question about this series of Egwene chapters </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-01 21:56:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just finished chapter 23, where Egwene completes her trial and is raised to Accepted. But I'm a little confused about this chapter

Something was wrong and the ter'angreal, the arch, started to behave weirdly. Once she got out, once she finished the trials, Alanna (Green) apologized profusely for not speaking up about what she felt and for endangering Egwene and wanted to share in Egwene's chores/punishment, which the Amrylin said no to. Then this paragraph comes up:

 The desire to confess had died in Egwene. ... She [Alanna] couldn't have deliberately caused the ter'angreal to go wild; I did that. Can she be Black Ajah?

What did she want to confess? That she was responsible for the ter'angreal misbehaving? How did Egwene come to that conclusion?

I remember in The Great Hunt during Nynaeve's trial she channeled while within one of the arches and when she came out she was warned that is terribly dangerous and not to do so again. But Egwene doesn't know that, right? So why/how does she blame herself?

---

I'm reading at work and get interrupted relatively often so my concentration gets broken. A lot happened the past few chapters, I just want to recap to make sure I've got it right:

* Verin gave Egwene the ring which supposedly helped the last Dreamer cross into the 'Dreamworld'
* Verin also gave Egwene the dossier with information on the 13 Aes Sedai who disappeared with Liandrin
* Sheriam mentioned... Something about 13 Aes Sedai and 13 Mydraal (or was it Dreadlords?) being needed for something but I can't remember for what. To make someone who can Channel succumb to the will of the Dark One? To still/gentle someone? Or something else entirely?


---

Overall I'm enjoying the book a lot, but it really feels like the last 2-4  chapters dumped a ton of information on the reader. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Driver side door won't close / Recall notice for faulty doors? </TITLE>

<TEXT> Below freezing and I went to go brush off the snow from my car / let it warm up prior to leaving for work this morning. Had to use a little effort to get the door open, and now it doesn't close. It doesn't full on swing open, but it's very clearly not secure. If I even bump it with my elbow, it'll swing open.

I found this recall online:

https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2015/04/24/ford-motor-company-issues-safety-recall-in-north-america-for-doo.html

So I'm going to call the dealership when they open in 30 minutes. I bought my 2014 in June of 2015, and this was issued April 2015... so it's very possible this was never performed on my car.

But 20 minutes after this happened, I ran out to my car again as I needed to park it elsewhere... and the door is fine now.

Could've just been the cold, I guess, but I've never heard of a car being stuck frozen open. Mostly just wanted to share that recall notice. I know it's a year old, but... </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Edit; mistyped the title, only 1 rule question -- just meant to type that I had a few questions in general.


I kind of lost interest in rally last year and didn't watch any, and I think I only caught maybe half of the 2015 season.

Decided to resubscribe to WRC+ the other day and watched the first rally. Really enjoyed it, I think it's going to be a great season. I wasn't aware of all the changes; namely bigger turbos. New manufacturer is always exciting. Generally, I never cared for Ogier. He's a fucking phenomenal driver and I respect the hell out of him, but he was always very impersonal and just gave off a douchey vibe IMO but this year he actually seemed like a pretty cool dude. Felt super bad for the Belgian going out like that, he was doing so well. Ott Tanak did pretty damn well too; last I remember of him was the "Titanak" when he accidentally went off a cliff into a river or something. Also, where's Mads this year? I saw he's doing some other rally; is he out of WRC entirely or just not participating in MC? Looks like Kris Meeke inherited his hardware problems :P and also why is Mikkelson in WRC2 / racing a Skoda?


Lastly, if a driver does not finish an individual stage in a rally, how is their overall time "scored"? Like say a driver basically totals his car on the last stage of day 2 but is able to compete and finishes on day 3. Do they just assign the Slowest time for the stage they didn't finish? Or is it a weighted average, or...? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I posted the other week having blown through the first half of TGH and wanted to share my enjoyment... guess I'm back.

**Broad strokes**

Awesome. I'm amazed at how quickly I finished this book, as someone who is still fairly new to reading for fun. Rand squaring off against Ba'alzamon was way more satisfying this time than EotW. I felt sincerely terrible for Egwene; being a damane seems terrible. Reminded me a little bit of the "Reek" chapters in ASOIAF. Overall though, I loved how much we start to learn about The White Tower and The One Power and just everything. The Ways are cool and the Black Wind is terrifying. Nynaeve's trial to become an Accepted was my favorite part of the whole book, I think. Can't wait to go crawl into bed and start #3.

---

**More specifically / Points of Interest**

I feel like I totally missed the ending to Chapter 48. Min finds Rand and then Lanfear, a Forsaken, just pops up out of nowhere to say "Hi" and then disappears. *What?* Like the Forsaken serve The Dark One, no? Why didn't she just fuck up Rand's unconcious body. Also, I need to go back and find a description of Selene, absently-minded wondering if they're the same person... I have nothing beyond my distrust for Selene / her absence in Cairhein to link these two as one, but I also can't think of a reason it might not be true. And would anyone be able to sum up what I should know about Lanfear by this point? Like the name rung a bell before "Forsaken" was dropped but I could only think, "I recognize that name." 

There are just so many characters, I can't keep them all 100% straight.

Is Liandrin the Black Ajay? I don't *think* so, but yet again I feel like I'm forgetting a detail from before. And what she did was definitely a [dick move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWY47bW8K3s). **Please don't spoil who IS, if it is not Liandrin**.

**Final question** -- does anyone know if the [WoT Re-Read Blog series on Tor.com](http://www.tor.com/series/wot-reread/) is safe from spoilers? I don't want to accidentally have something ruined / pointed out. Obviously stay away from the posts for the books I haven't read yet, but would it be a bad idea to look at the posts for each book as I finish them? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just started noticing this fairly quiet noise. It only seems to happen above 40 mph. Doesn't matter the gear, RPM doesn't seem to matter either but it's tough to tell for sure. I can hear it on the highway at 2.5-3K RPM or on the street at ~2K or below.

Haven't really had the time to investigate it unfortunately, but as soon as I put my foot on the gas, even the tiniest amount, I can hear a kind of faint "airy" noise. It sounds to my **non**-expert opinion like it's having trouble "breathing". I popped the hood but couldn't see anything obvious.

It hasn't been *especially* cold, a little above freezing for the most part. I had winter tires put on recently and thought my brakes sounded different / feel more while braking, so I've been paying extra close attention to every little noise. Not sure if this this something I just never noticed, or if it's actually a new noise.

Is there a way I can look up to see if my vehicle is still under the factory warranty? It's only got 19K on it, but it's a '14... Not sure when the 3 years is up. Also, any ideas what I might be hearing?

I'll try to get a recording today after work but with just a cell phone I think you'll get nothing but wind noise... </TEXT>

<TITLE> No spoilers: Do you think it'd be feasible to actually skip the first book? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm a little over half way through book #2 and I've been talking to my other Reading friends about how much I enjoy it, despite how much I struggled to read #1. It took me three separate tries to finish the first book, though I'm much more into reading now than the last 2 times I had picked it up. 

So they're a little apprehensive because of my experience with EotW. We're all into epic fantasies, starting with A Song of Ice And Fire, then Mistborn and Stormlight, but now we've all branched off into reading our own things.

Just curious, do you guys think one could still appreciate the series if one only read a synopsis of the first book? 

While it is slow, the pacing did a good job of building a sense of fear and paranoia amongst the characters. I think a lot might be lost without actually reading about Mat's dagger, as well as the relationships / dynamics between all of the characters. Particularly Nynaeve as she feels very strongly about *everything*.

On the other hand, because it's 14 friggen books, I think that there's enough to come that it wouldn't make such a huge difference if you skipped #1. But again, I'm only half way through #2 so what do I know. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh my god. It took me so much to push through the first book. Overall I liked it, enough to continue cleaely, and I'm glad I did. 

Nynaeve's entire "test" was cool. I don't much care for the Lan love arc, it seemed to come out of left field in the first book -- for both characters -- or maybe I just really am that oblivious? So the third arc was a little cheesy I thought, but then she just says "To hell with you, and hell with your Ass Sedai rules" and fucking portals her way out. And then finally the Amrylin.

I just thought it was a really fucking cool and "rewarding" chapter. I'm enjoying TGH so much more than EotW and this chapter just really sealed the deal.

I told myself I was going to alternate reading something by Jordan and then once that's finished I'd something by Sanderson until I've finished both. But I just ordered book number 3, so we'll see about that.

None of my friends have read WoT and I just needed to freak out after that chapter.

Oh and also I accidentally saw l a thread titled "Does anyone else not like Nynaeve?" or something like that. I didn't read it, but 1/2 through book number 2 I can definitely get it so far. 

She has like 3 modes: Overbearing mother / Condescending-tone mother, Hate Aes Sedai, Random love interest out of nowhere. I just want to yell at her, "You get to be a badass wizard. Shut up and say thank you!" OK maybe not 'Thank You' after having to leave behind her home in that second Arch, but you get the point! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question about dog tag silencers </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-09 14:26:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Sorry if this is the wrong sub, but I don't know where to ask this. 

My brother was in the national guard and passed away in November. I started wearing his dog tag, and then over Christmas my mother gave me this beautiful necklace pendant with his ashes. 

I want to wear them both, but any time I move at all they clink together and it's very annoying. I looked around for dog tag silencers, but all I can find are this style: 

https://img1.etsystatic.com/000/0/6638710/il_570xN.292084419.jpg

These don't work for me as the pendant can and does clink against the exposed metal. 

I've temporarily solved this by wrapping the dog tag in paper, then putting the silencer on but this is not a very good solution. I shower with them on, and obviously the paper won't hold up. 

**Question / TLDR:** Do they make dog tag silencers which **fully** cover it? Ideally I want something like what I linked above, but with a clear plastic that goes over the "body" of the tag itself, rather than just the edges. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-01-03 18:39:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I finished book #1 over Christmas weekend. Overall, I enjoyed it. The first half was so very slow but when they finally get to Caemlyn it really starts to pick up. But then the last few chapters when they go to the Eye just felt... I don't know what the word is. Not *rushed*, but something like that.

Aside from Lan   Moraine, the rest of our party is mostly defenseless. Yea they've been practicing with their weapons, but they've had almost no real experience.

Then Rand just suddenly goes Beastmode and severed Bazalmon's dark tether thing and now he's dead and everything is OK. Our teenaged sheepherder just squared off with the big baddie and it felt so anticlimactic, premature, hard to believe and so on.

I'm 1/4 of the way finished with The Great Hunt, so obviously I enjoyed it enough to keep reading  (and know more about the Dark One than at the end of EotW) but I periodically think back to the end of the first book and just don't "get" it. It felt like if you watched The Matrix and movie transitioned from Neo training with Morpheus in the dojo after he's first brought into the real world, then jump to Neo facing off against the group of men with the Merovingian in the second movie -- in terms of prowess / strength gain.

I just can't help but think that Rand should *not* have been able to do that so soon or so easily.

* 5.58.5 inch Sketch pad (so, not meant for paint obviously)
* $4 Crayola set of watercolors

I know that a good artist can make a nice painting even with some pretty poor quality supplies. However, I also fully realize the importance of using quality supplies and the difference they make -- I simply just don't have the money to fund the hobby.

Anyways, I have two questions: 

* Should I even bother trying to learn with these very limited resources, or would that just be an exercise in frustration? 
* If you guys think it *might* be reasonable to give it a shot, any tips? Controlling the water on the brush and having just these dinky little ovals of paint is really difficult and time consuming. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Familial Details: My brother passed away in November. He was going through a very rocky time with his wife, who wasn't exactly high on my list for a Sister In Law. They were separated and my brother was living with my parents, but they weren't legally divorced yet. They have a son, my nephew, who will be turning 4 next spring. I live ~450 miles from all of my family.

---

I was home for Christmas last week and my parents went to visit their grandson on Christmas Eve but I didn't go with them because I don't much like my sister in law's family. But also because I just didn't have the strength to see my brother's son.

I never really had any relationship or interactions with my two uncles when I was young, and now that I'm older my aunts all got divorced and I don't see the uncles anymore, ever. I didn't want it to be that way with my nephew, I wanted to be a part of his life -- especially since I don't particularly want kids of my own. Maybe be the cool rich uncle who spoils him, or just help keep him on the right track as my brother wasn't the smartest, nor his wife.

But now... I've just been feeling confused or unsure of what to make of my relationship with my nephew. He's still family and all, but without my brother, combined with the distance, it's different somehow. I feel selfish for "withdrawing" because I don't like my SIL and her family but I don't know what to do or anything.

<TEXT> My friend bought a 2014 Corolla LE Eco last year. It has about 30K miles on it.

Last winter he complained about how poor it handles on the snow, how light and floaty and slippery it feels. This weekend we got a light dusting, probably 2" max. I commented to him how I was surprised that my Fiesta ST had no issues, as I figured with all that torque and lightweight it was going to be bad. Don't have the money for winter tires this year.

He said his Corolla was already slipping last night, before all of the snow had even fallen.

For those of you in colder / snowy climates, how has it been?

Also, I was wondering what tires come stock on the car? I found measurements, but couldn't find brand / model. </TEXT>

 What is the hub hole diameter size in the middle of the rim?

But I can't seem to find the measurement. Just stuff for the lug nut pattern, offsets, or tire /wheel width... Does anyone here know? </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's an HPDE school near me that has Novice classes available for the 2017 season at Watkins Glen International in New York.

For those who have taken their FiST out to a proper track day, not just autocross, how is it? I'm concerned about it overheating primarily. But any other concerns?

I did this once, two years ago in my 350Z but it was actually pretty intimidating and I was a bit out of my element. But now that I've done some autocross, and will have done more by the time this event rolls around I'll be more confident. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really really don't want to spend the money on winter tires this year. I have the winter tires from my 350Z in the attic still. I'm not sure of the measurements off the top of my head but I want to say they're on the stock 18x8.5" wheels.

I suppose buying wheels with the FiST's bolt pattern might be equally as expensive, if not more, than winter tires, but assuming that is cheaper, can these tires fit the FiST OK?

I've had no luck trying to sell them on Craigslist to fund new ones of appropriate size. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm a software engineer and I've been at my company for about 2 year and have been employed in my field for 4 years since graduating. Database work is by far my weakest skill and I greatly prefer programming applications.

Yesterday, a coworker of mine on the Database team mentions to me a recent update I made to one of our modules isn't working right. Half of the data that's supposed to be written to a file is missing. After some tooling around, I identified that the data I was receiving from the DB was in the incorrect order. I tell him this, and he tells me that it's in the right order when he generates it on his end blah blah blah it **must** be an issue with how the code deals with hundreds of thousands of records in memory and I'm not doing something right.

Because DB work is my weakest skill, he's been employed here way longer, and has been working in the field in general way longer than I have, I take his word for it. Spent literally all afternoon researching what could be going wrong, then for shits and giggles I decide to run the DB code on the DB itself... Sure enough it's in the wrong fucking order. He didn't even bother to check. I called him over and showed him exactly where the data was wrong in the application side code and he assured me it was correct in the DB.

(If you're asking yourself, "But /u/subject721 why didn't you just check the DB in the first place? Could have saved yourself hours of effort" it's because the DB code that runs takes a solid 20+ minutes to execute and if I let it run while I'm trying to figure out what's wrong on the code side then it'll take even longer, so I took his word for it trusting his experience in the field)

I get it -- we all make mistakes. I'm not mad his script is broken. But what the fuck, he didn't even try to confirm what I told him I suspect to be the issue before dismissing me.

And this isn't the first or even the second time I've had a problem with this guy. Shortly after I started working here, we did a production update and a module I worked on was no longer working. "Well it's got to be something the code is doing". It took me a while to determine the cause of the problem was because he simply lost the database scripts I gave him. Normally I'd just email the files to the DBA, but since I was new at the company he specifically instructed me on where to upload the files to our network where he maintains a list of all the DB changes. But somehow he lost the file, and even though I was like "I'm pretty sure this is just running the old DB script" he was insistent he didn't miss anything and that I missed a something in the actual code for the update.

There was a third incident as well, which happened sometime between these two incidents but I honestly don't remember the details. Another co-worker, who is also relatively new at the company, has shared a lot of my frustrations with this guy and has some other complaints of his own about this dude too.

I really wanted to talk to our boss yesterday at the end of the day, but I decided not to. I was frustrated and probably wouldn't have articulated myself well. Hell, I don't think I would be any better today.

Have any of you guys had to deal with an over-confident coworker who refuses to even *consider* he might be wrong unless you jump through hurdles proving it? What can I do / how could I talk to my boss about this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This spell is worded so poorly.

My party last night got into a pretty big battle when our Druid polymoprphed the creature into a harmless rabbit then killed it.

I was like, "I'm pretty sure it doesn't work that way" then we re-read the spell and there was a bit of confusion but we just let it ride.

For next time though, if you turn a monster into something much much weaker, kill that thing, it turns back into the original form with an amount of HP lost equal to the HP of the thing it was turned into right?

Like say it has 50 HP and you turn it into something with 5 HP, kill that 5 HP then it reverts back to it's original form at 45, right? </TEXT>

<TITLE> My motherboard is slightly(?) defective; what are the implications? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 2 weeks ago my 5 year old computer shit the bed. I replaced the motherboard, CPU, and RAM. I bought an EVGA Z170 FTW edition, i5-6500, and 8GB of DDR4 RAM.

In the BIOS, my computer was reporting only 4GB of RAM in one of the banks and then just said "unrecognized" in the other bank, and Windows was *highly* unstable.

I RMA'd the RAM and bought some 2x8GB kit of PNY memory from Best Buy just to hold me over until NewEgg processes my replacement.

Well, BIOS only reports 8GB now and Windows is still unstable. Can't run any applications, can't shut down, can't open the task manager -- can't do anything other than boot to my desktop reliably.

Did a fresh reinstall of Windows using the built-in repair utility in Windows 10. This fixed my usability issues! Now Windows runs perfectly. But my computer is still only detecting 8GB of RAM.

I *really* don't want to disassemble my PC, RMA the motherboard, wait for a replacement, and re-build the whole thing.

I'm wondering what are the implications if I were to just deal with my computer as is? Obviously I'm shorting myself on my memory, won't be able to take advantage of dual channel etc. but is there really any other problem? I'm concerned if something more serious goes wrong in the future, then who knows what...

I did download the latest chipset drivers from EVGA's website, but I haven't upgraded the BIOS. Full disclosure, I've never flashed the BIOS before and I'm afraid of fucking it up. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT>  A	model	may 	not	declare	a	Charge	 if	it 	is	currently	engaged	by	an	enemy	model.	A	model	may 	not	target	an	enemy	model	that	it	is	currently	engaging 	with 	a	 Charge.

Can someone explain exactly what the second sentence means?

I found out yesterday that my local scene has been playing this very wrong.

 We've basically been reading it as "May not target a model with a Charge if it is currently engaging" -- as in, if Seenah and Obulus are duking it out, I couldn't charge Obulus with Jaecar because he is engaging Seenah.

I know now that is incorrect.... So what exactly is this rule saying? Is that too prevent shenanigans with models that have Counter-Charge? ie "You ended your activation and now I get to Counter Charge even though we're both engaging"?

Furthermore: If I have Counter-Charge, it **does** trigger it my opponent's Charge fails to get them into melee, right?

**Edit** Re-reading it, it's basically just saying you can't charge a model you're already in melee with. So in my situation above, Seenah can't charge Obulus because Seenah is already engaging Obulus. Is that correct?

**Double Edit**: Thanks for the clarification everyone. I have no idea how we got it so wrong this whole time! It's definitely been a "least favorite" rule, glad one of the guys noticed this. I've been gimping Seenah so hard this whole time!! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a $300 budget and need a new motherboard and processor as mine shit the proverbial bed on Monday. I had a second-gen i7 with an LGA 1155 socket.

The cheapest board [on Amazon] compatible with my current processor is $160 made by some brand I've never heard of; Tyan. So it seems like I may as well spend a bit more and get a new CPU unless someone has a better idea.

I would like to retain the DDR3 RAM I have currently, and I have a strong preference for an EVGA branded board. I've had terrible luck with Asus products over the past 5 years. Current board is MSI and it's been OK but a little wonky since day 1.

I was looking at these two motherboards:

https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00K8KPXUO/ref=aw_wl_ov_dp_1_2?colid=3DAHR1QKZQG6Q coliid=IMBMAQ8KTZ156 vs=1

But I don't understand what the difference is. Amazon's product details blow ass, and NewEgg is blocked at work. Are there just charging more because it's branded gaming, or is there some actual difference?

Looking at this processor:

https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00CO8TBOW/ref=aw_wl_ov_dp_1_1?colid=3DAHR1QKZQG6Q coliid=I3TWS9HVO5UA8G

If I go with the "gaming" motherboard I've exceeded my budget a more than I'd like.

* 8GB RAM
* 1TB HDD
* 500GB SSD
* 120GB SSD
* GTX 970
* 750W PSU
* Windows 10

Computer was running OK yesterday, an extended session of Deus Ex: Mankind Divided didn't cause any major issues, though the UI was being weird in the game (icons on the hotbar not refreshing quickly, that sort of thing) but no outstanding issues.

I booted up this morning and after a few seconds it just reboots itself. I let it it do this for about 5 minutes and eventually I got a screen that said it couldn't use the overclock settings and let me get into the BIOS... But I don't OC any of my hardware. Tried rebooting and back to square one.

I unplugged my GPU, all my drives, reconnected the main mobo connectors and booted it back up. Didn't restart itself.

No onboard video so I plugged in my video card and a monitor and it booted up again, except my monitor wasn't getting power (ancient house, likely something screwy with the outlets because if I swap outlets the PC still works).

Plug everything back in to my desk and it's restarting itself again. I unplugged drives, USB peripherals, everything I could but it's not staying on.

Unfortunately I don't have a spare PSU to test with or anything like that.

Any ideas? Thanks.

Edit: Replaced the PSU, not that. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I [26M] think my roommate [23M] is becoming schizophrenic </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-04 14:50:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **TL:DR** Craigslist roommate who is likely depressed and abuses alcohol / marijuana was sent home from work for "saying crazy shit", said he can see colors with meaning, auras, and the he's moved things with his mind. He also said he will "give a week's notice, but is going to show us how connected to the earth he is". My other roommate and I are concerned both for our own well-being and his health. Wtf do we do?



A few months ago my other roommate [27M] and I had to fill an empty bedroom in our 3BR apartment, but didn't know anyone so we grabbed someone off Craigslist.

He seemed OK, a little odd, mumbles a lot, a little depressed / lonely but has a decent job and a GF and doesn't cause problems, and at the end of the day we just need someone to pay rent.

Couple months go by and me and the other roommate definitely agree this guy is weird, he's said he's moved stuff with his mind while meditating but we kind of just chocked it up to him being a massive pothead.

The past 2 weeks or so, my roommate was saying how Craigslist guy has been acting really weird, that they've had some weird conversations. My friend / older roommate is working becoming a guidance counselor and the CL-dude knows this so he's kind of confided in him a bit and we've tried to get him to see an actual professional but he can't really afford to.

Then yesterday, I guess his GF got a call from his boss telling her to come pick him up because he's saying "crazy shit". She dropped him off at our place and he told her he was just going to get some stuff then go to her place. He never went to her place, so she started panicking. I guess the cops were looking for him, as well as some mental health crisis group.

Eventually he shows up at our place and that health group swung by and did some sort of assessment, talking to him. Despite saying he can "see colors with meaning" and "auras", apparently they thought he was fine and did nothing.

Then later that day, my two roommates were talking again and he described himself as "blue, and a little orange, but trying to get rid of that". He also said something about how he thinks it's all connected, the universe, my other roommate trying to help this guy, a "no smoking" sign we have in our living room (he's trying to quit cigarettes". Then most unsettling of all, he says "I'll give you a week's notice, but I'm going to show you how connected to the earth I am".

My roommate asked if he should be concerned, by he said he won't hurt anyone / himself, and we mostly believe that... But still, WTF. At the very least we're both extremely uncomfortable.

This dude clearly needs help, but we have no idea what to do. I'm not comfortable with him living with us, but no idea what to do. How could we kick him out? We're on a month-to-month rental property, but if he's unstable who knows what he might do.

My sane roommate's GF knows someone who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and she said this guy's behavior is very similar to the other person before he "snapped", so we think it's that / sounds similar to what I've read on wikipedia but we obviously don't know. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I took a beginner course a year ago and then continued fencing for about a month or two after that, then stopped.

I just signed up for beginner classes at a different, cheaper school a few weeks ago and just thought of a question after we practiced Parry 4's and 6's last week.

Is the idea to deflect the blade **and** keep the bout going, or do you not really care if you deflect the blade so it connects off target? I guess all that matters is denying your opponent the touch, but while practicing with one of the guys last week he kept hitting my arm when I'd try to parry 6.

I'm left handed and he is right handed,  he was aiming for my chest and as I'd try to push his blade out of the way it often resulted in my arm taking the hit.

As I said before, I guess so long as they don't score a touch then good enough, but I kept thinking that if this were an actual bout that would get really tedious having to halt every single time. So am I doing something wrong, or is this just kind of normal / part of learning? </TEXT>

I know tire width helps grip, obviously, but how does the diameter come into play? Simply just more rubber to "share the load" and prevent them from getting worn out too fast?

Then on the other end of the spectrum why do you see such small tires on rally cars? 15 or 16" are quite common there. Is that just because of requirements dictated by the governing body? ie "must not stray too far from OEM sizes" or something? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a web application using C#, .NET 4.0, MVC and RazorViews.

On a page within our site, we have links to a variety of audio files, primarily mp3's.

If the user has something other than Windows Media Player set as their default media player, they are able to stream the mp3 straight from our website. VLC Player does this perfectly.

If they have WMP as their default player, however, the application launches and pops up with the following error:

 Windows Media Player cannot play the file. The latter nigh not support the file type or night not support the codec that was used to compress the file.

This can be resolved by simply downloading and installing a third-party codec and then it will work with WMP.

But if you look at the wikipedia entry for WMP, it says streaming capabilities have been improved with version 12.

Am I missing something? I've tried googling around but a lot of results just recommend using all sorts of third party solutions, using different media players, adding a media player control to a desktop application, or were answers about how to go into WMP and stream something manually. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I completely missed this, in a blog post on their website Hansi announced they're playing Imaginations From the Other Side in full this year.

I was literally just saying to a friend the other day, "I'm excited to see them two years in a row but I didn't love BtRM so I hope the setlist is different enough." So that's definitely different enough.

Not my favorite album of theirs, but I've never had an opportunity to see a band play an album in its entirety so I'm super excited now. </TEXT>

<TITLE> First autocross event last weekend </TITLE>

<TEXT> I did my first Autocross event ever, this weekend. I've done an HPDE a year ago at Watkins Glen International in a 350Z which was insanely fun, but I felt a bit out of my league. This autocross event was much better for me.

I was so slow, but it felt good seeing seconds drop off each lap.

Here a playlist of 5 of my 8 runs.

http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8zklCxSqdGVSeRdi_9kgxnrOvDkMgefe

 Unfortunately my GoPro died before I could record my fastest laps, but I went from 57 seconds on my first lap down to 46 seconds by the end of the day. 34 seconds was the fastest time of the day, and the other FiST at the event did a 0:37 run so I clearly have a ton of room for improvement but hey I'm content with 17^th out of 20 in my group.

<TEXT> I'm just curious, what are some things you guys encounter while playing D D that annoy you?

For me, one of the biggest things is Rogues who check goddamn every openable object for traps.

I think it interrupts the game, narrative and general "immersion" to constantly have to roll a skill check every single time the party goes through a door to the point where it honestly annoys me. Admittedly, in my current campaign we have *two* Rogues, but someone is *always* describing how they're going to open a door and rolling for it. I just think that, as a role-playing game, if your character feels compelled to check every single surface for a trap either they're a really shitty thief with no intuition, or have a mental disorder.

I get that DM's aren't just going to say, "Hey there are no traps in here" because it they *don't* say it then you'll know there are. But it's just so tiresome. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [WoR] Question about Syl </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-19 19:00:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just downloaded the Stormlight Companion Book and under the "Named Spren"  it has this entry:

 Sylphrena, better known as Syl, is an honorspren bonded to Kaladin. She embodies the charateristics of her type of spren, being changeable and playful, while also urging Kaladin to embrace the ideals of the Windrunners. **She bears some relationship to the Stormfather, who seems to feel responsible for all windspren and to have forbidden them from entering into bonds and making new surgebinders**

So, I don't get it. Syl is an Honorspren, but then it says the Stormfather feels responsible for all Windspren. Do Spren start as one type, then for unknown reasons become attracted to something in the physical realm and start to bond, then change their "type"? Based off the 'entering into bonds' it sounds like that might be the case?


**Edit** Under the Stormfather's entry we have this line:

 As one of the three spren who can bond with humans to create a Bondsmith ...

So maybe it's more limited. Only Spren of types X,Y,Z can become A,B, or C? </TEXT>

How is the order of operations resolved for a single Character Play? For example, if Stave uses his Heroic, can you Push the model, then after the Push do damage? If this kills Vileswarm, where does he explode? Or if the model being hit has the Ball, from where does it Scatter-- before or after the Push? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got into fencing last year for about half a year, so I know the basics but far from an expert.

Just watching USA vs UK in the Olympics right now and it sounded like one of the announcers said "You can block with your arm since that's not a valid target."

It sounded like they're implying it's common tactic to actively use your arm to block your flank.

Now, from a sport point of view, that *sort of* makes sense to force their point to hit an invalid target, but from a sword fighting stand point that's obviously really stupid to actively put your body in harm's way (though I suppose the arm is better than the flank, if I had to pick where to be stabbed).

It'll still pause the action since it's off target, but is it considered "a dick move" to actively try and "block" with your arm, or does no one really care? </TEXT>

<TITLE> [WoR] Question about the Heralds / prominent character at the end of the book </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-03 15:44:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I've generally been assuming the Heralds are reborn as "regular men" who discover their powers in life. If you read the descriptions in the WoK prelude, some of them around very similar to Kaladin, Dalinar, and Shallan or maybe Jasnah.

I was discussing this idea with my roommate yesterday and he made a good point that this might not be the case because Nin / Nalen saved  Szeth after he died.

If Nin / Nalan knows this name, then it stands to reason the Heralds "permanently" exist despite being able to die, right? Like it's not as if they get "reincarnated" into someone else-- they just come back as themselves.

So I'm thinking I'm completely wrong about my original assessment. Are all of our characters, Kaladin, Dalinar, Shallan, Renarin, Jasnah and possibly Szeth simply just "regular" Radiants who would be a member of an Order headed by one of the Heralds?

I guess I'm just having trouble trying to understand the "hierarchy" to the whole Knights Radiant / Heralds thing, and I'm thrown off by the WoK-Prelude implication that the Heralds cannot truly die. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Quick rule question about Stave... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-02 04:16:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Lob Barrel states:

 All models hit suffer a [4] Push directly away from the
centre of the AOE and the knocked-down condition.
This Character Play may only be used once per turn.

Now, the way I understand this rule, regardless of where the model is in relation to the center, if it's hit, it is pushed 4".

I played my Brewers for the first time against a relatively new player and he was pushing models equal to the difference of 4" and [models' distance from the center]".

So if I only just barely clipped a model with the AOE, he'd only push it 2.5" because because it's a 3" AOE, 1.5" radius... 1.5 + 2.5 = 4.

I'm *quite sure* this is not correct, but I can't find anything explicitly stating otherwise.

He was pretty salty the entire night when he learned that a charge doesn't have to be  **directly** towards a model and that Tapper can Old Jakes himself (was insistent that 'friendly guild model' means another model until I showed him Hearne's Heroic which explicitly states 'other guild model', and even then his argument was it could've been erratad in season 2) so I was just like, whatever I'm not even gonna argue it.

Edit: derp, the definition for a Push clearly states "pushed up to the distance shown".

I was looking for AoE rules and stuff :( </TEXT>

<TITLE> What do you guys think of Casket's Legendary / Seenah's Trait? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-26 16:24:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm still pretty new to GB, playing against the Morticians with my Hunters last night.

It was probably the most fun game I've played, ending when he Icy Sponged Casket and managed to finish off Egret, securing the final 4 VP he needed for the win.

I understand Legendary Plays are once-per-game, but does Casket seem a tad too strong to you guys? Both Character Plays are really good, his Traits are extremely strong (admittedly, all the Light Footed Hunters are well equipped to deal with his bullshit) and then you have Casket Time. Oh and also he generates an Influence for the team.

Compare this to Mob Favorite on Seenah. He's a good model, but he generates no Influence, has a Playbook-Result-Only Character Play (admittedly it is very strong)  that requires 6+ successes to be used.

In the ~month I've been playing 2-3 games a week, I've gotten Mob Favorite once.

Admittedly, I'm sure a lot of this boils down to me not using Seenah to his maximum effectiveness but it seems pretty difficult to actually get Bear Hug with any reliability. Yea he rolls 11 or more Dice on the charge, but more than half of those need to be successes, after armor, for Hug to go off.

Now I suppose you're saying, "If you're charging something that isn't Snared you're doing it wrong", which is pretty fair. This was the first game I didn't run Hearne, and I didn't have Zarola either so my only real opportunities for Snare were Theron and Chaska/Jaecar traps-- and against the Morticians with Puppet Master *and* Lure, those Traps are more of a liability than anything.

Just wanted to see what some more seasoned players thought? Different models, different roles, but with some minor overlap... </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Q) What is the definition of "condition damage" (pg 16)**


Example, if someone dies to Seenah's Bear Hug's Bleed damage,
		does that trigger 'Mob Favorite!' ? I'm guessing no.


----


**Q) How exactly do Icy Sponges work? How many do you get?**


This is my interpreation after reading it 3 times:

* The first time, you only heal up to [IS1] HP.
* The second time, you can heal up to [IS2] HP [which you'll obviously do instead].
* Third time and beyond, you can still only heal up to [IS2] HP? 

I guess this would make the most sense -- we can't have our athletes *dying* now can we?


----

**Q) Do Dodges / Pushes ignore intervening models?**

Someone told me Yes, they ignore them (can't stop 'on top' of them, of course) but you can freely move around them. Reading the rules, ti seems like it's specifically **terrain** that doesn't impede these re-positioning effects?

I was just hoping someone could tell me a little bit about the Hunters? Steam Forged's website isn't exactly spectacular lol.


Edit: So I was actually *really* surprised everything I bought cost me $180... but is the entire faction only 8 models? Did I literally just buy *an entire faction* for under $200?

<TEXT> I used to have a 350Z and did a HPDE course at Watkins Glen International last year, which was a ton of fun.

I unfortunately had to switch to a Fiesta ST, now I'm looking to do autocross.

I found my region website; wny-scca.com

Looks to decently active. I wanted to try and talk to people first / meet people before I get started. So.. anyone in the Buffalo area? How is the crowd?

----

As far as autocross itself is concerned, how stressful on the car is it? Would I be doing once per month in my DD?

Obviously, it's much lower speeds than Watkins Glen, but I'll still be at high RPMs the entire time. Not as hard on my brakes, but I'm sure they'll still get quite the work out.

Would I need dedicated tires / brake pads / fresh fluids each time? I'm afraid I'm under-estimating the wear and tear autocross can do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I live down town, on street parking. The streets are lined with trees, the kind that just love to drip sap all over the place.

I just picked up a Fiesta ST this weekend with the gorgeous tri-coat Molten Orange color. Is there anything I can do to try and help preserve the paint when I've little choice but to park under these trees?


Edit: just noticed the typo in my title. Should say "paint", not "paying". Stupid phone  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I found a lot of reviews online talking about the quality and results of this package, but nothing really about how long it takes to install everything.

I won't be buying it soon, but just so I can plan-- roughly how long does it take to install everything? I'll most likely be paying to have it done (no tools / not a mechanical person / on street parking; no drive way) so I'm just wondering how much more it'll cost than the price for the parts itself... </TEXT>

<TITLE> Dumb questions from a new owner / new to Ford in general; adjusting the seats? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-19 18:46:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just picked up my 2014 Molten Orange FiST yesterday and I love the car! These recaros are insane, they hug you so well. But the headrest feels a little wierd, like they're angled *forward*. I don't often put my head against the headrest, but when I do it's very unpleasant, like I have to angle my head downwards.

Is there a way to adjust this? The dealership didn't have the user manual, but I find a 2016 manual online. But what they show doesn't seem to match up, at least not with the recaros. I assume it's a difference between the regular seats you'd get in a non-STR trim Fiesta.

Also, the guy at the dealership told me the lever on the side of the seat adjusts it up and down, but when I crank it makes a teeny tiny adjustment forward and back, even though the seat also has the manual bar to adjust the seat underneath. Like this lever just lets me "fine tune" what that bar unearth the seat allows. I definitely feel a little higher up than I'd like, I'd love to find out how to lower them...


Also, do they pipe in noise into the cabin via the speakers? I know they should be taken with a grain of salt but in the [Regular Car Review](https://youtu.be/gw-3zLZheII?t=5) he says they are. But a buddy of mine who owns one says they're actually not. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How to Smoke when you're behind? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-05 21:32:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm a pretty average 3-point-something K MMR player.

I realize that at this level, smokes are one of the most heavily under-utilized item in my matches and I rarely see them beyond a Lycan or Ursa picking it up to solo smoke.

When we have decent offensive vision, I try to encourage the team to gather to smoke and go for a kill when I can and usually this works well.

Periodically, I'll be losing a game and someone urges we smoke and try to get kills... When we have zero offensive vision, and minimal or no defensive vision. I've always felt like this is absolutely a terrible idea; we're already behind, unexpectedly walking into the whole team will probably be a disaster.

I feel like it's a waste of time; we're not farming, we don't know where we're going, and we don't know what we're going to find if anything.

I suppose it varies from game to game, team comp to team comp, but am I wrong? Is it a decent idea to smoke and hunt even if you don't have adequate vision?

Generally speaking, how should one handle such a situation? I'd much rather simply try to get up some defensive vision and farm, let them come to us under a tower or fail to find a pick off of their own in our jungle then try to go on the offense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been diagnosed with depression, take medication for it and see a therapist. One thing I've come to realize is that I hold myself to impossibly high standards and dismiss any compliments because I feel like the other person doesn't know the whole truth, both in my professional life and personal life.

While talking with my therapist, I cited a recent example where a coworker said I was a good guy and a good programmer. But I don't believe it to be true because he works in a different department, and while my software might meet his direct criteria, under the hood there's a lot that could be improved (which he doesn't see; only the end product).

She said that because I don't respect myself, because I'm never content with anything I do, it prevents me from ever really respecting others as well.

While I don't fully agree with that entire sentiment, she is mostly right. I do realize my expectations and standards are unrealistic, but despite my best efforts to lighten up, to be nicer to myself or more forgiving of my mistakes / shortcomings, I can't seem to really "accept" or internalize these views. I can't really believe them.

At what point do you say, "OK, I've done the best I can and that's good enough for me"? How do I stop *always* searching for things to improve while simultaneously dismissing everything else? Bleh. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Anyone else think the new Armlet is insanely powerful? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I played a few games last night, once against a Wraith King who picked up Armlet first pretty early, and a second game where my roommate grabbed it on Legion Commander.

5 Additional free armor is bonkers. It now gives more than a max rank Frost Armor from Lich. Combined with the new Armor aura from towers, and the increased base HP / HP per Strength, you can get very fat very early.

Admittedly, these are only 2 All Pick games with minimal thought put into team comps, we could've done more to deal with that Wraith King but he just felt unstoppable. The Legion Commander game wasn't bad, but we all played poorly and it didn't go well.

We do have that new component for Medallion, blanking on its name, which could help to mitigate some of all that new armor, but damn.



I also didn't realize how much it's gotten buffed over each patch. In a year and a half since 6.82, the cost has dropped by almost 300g between Recipe cost reductions and the components themselves getting cheaper. I think this item has always enjoyed a good bit of popularity, but I really think it's going to explode in popularity this patch.

What has been your experience with the new Armlet? </TEXT>

<TITLE> (Spoilers Everything) Theory about Tyrion's origins? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-26 19:31:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So we know Dany is a Targaryen. The leading fan theory is that Jon is, as well.


I haven't been super into ASOIAF since finishing the most recent book a few years ago but now that the TV show is back on I'm a bit excited again. So I don't know if there's a leading theory on who the third Targaryen is-- the house crest is a three headed dragon after all.


Tyrion was on the boat with "Griff" aka Aegon after leaving Westeros behind. But they've been separated for a while so as far as I know his status is Unknown. Please correct me if I'm wrong there.


I was talking to my coworker today, he had this theory that Tyrion is actually a bastard Targaryen, and these were his supporting arguments:


His mother was in King's Landing in the year 272 and one of the Targaryen's ruling at the time made comments to her, asking if her body was ruined from giving birth to the twins

Tyrion was born in 273, a year later (so, depending on when she was in King's Landing it could have been only 9 months)

Tyrion was described as a hideous baby with "a monster, with a tail, monstrous huge head, thick black hair, a beard, an evil eye, lion's claws, with teeth so long he was not able to close his mouth, and both male and female genitals." (From westeros.org). Sounds a lot like a dragon to me. This could be a way for people to say he's a Targaryen, without committing the offense / insult of directly calling him one. I also just found a note saying that Dragons are neither male nor female, which is also significant considering the description mentions he has both genitals.


Building on that, this story was brought up in both the book (I believe Cersei tells Tyrion), and in the show (Oberyn described his disappointment that Tyrion was simply crippled, not a monster, when he visited Tyrion in his prison cell before his Trial for allegedly killing Joffrey). So clearly this description of him must be somewhat important to the audience, whether we knew it or not.


And in the show he's already in Dany's good graces. So that's a plus.

Thoughts? Criticisms? Corrections?

I never heard this theory before, it seems fairly sound. Though I'm not sure what would become of Griff / Aegon if he lives. Guess he's not a sibling of Dany's, but rather the nephew of, so she'd still have claim to the thrown over him. Or maybe he'll die in the books and just never appear in the show. </TEXT>

<TEXT> At my first job out of college, I worked individually with small businesses developing custom software for them. Solely responsible for all aspects of development. As a very disorganized person (hardcore ADD and just not organized in general) this was not a good role for me. They'd kind of just email me stuff and I'd try to work on it. Having direct contact with the person or people who make the end decisions was helpful, but yea overall this just wasn't good.

At my next job, we used a bug tracking system called JIRA. Most of my work was pretty simple and overall this worked fairly well. It was also a very large operation. 15 UI developers, 10 back end developers, a few DBA's plus managers for each team.

At my current job, we use a different tracker called Mantis, but it's more or less the same. But for the nature of our business it's not as effective. Or perhaps it's just how we use it. Here, it's me and one other developer plus our boss, and a single DBA though we do some of the DB work too.

---- 

 At my last job, I worked on a single software product. At my current job, we have a few different products under one umbrella all part of separate Solution files (.net dev) but they all share a singular Login solution and that routes them to the correct "module" based on their login credentials. There's also a few other projects completely separate to this "main" product line.

I often find myself having to go back and forth digging through emails, bug postings and calling / talking to my boss and it just feels like a lot of overhead to get all relevant information. Coincidentally, I was just creating an Excel document to track all of my stuff when my 1 coworker just messaged me saying she also wishes we had better documentation (she started this job 2 weeks after I did and she has pretty much identical work experience as me).

So, what does your company do? Do you think it works well? Any suggestions for me? I want to propose *something* to my boss, but I need to come up with a better, easy system. But I'm afraid of introducing more beauracracy, especially when something like this can usually fall apart very easily unless everyone is on board and uses it. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was diagnosed in middle school wth ADD. Last year (well over 10 years later) I got re-diagnosed, after college when I was afraid it was effecting my job.

When I got re-diagnosed, I was also diagnosed with depression which wasn't exactly a shock to me. I've been taking the ADD medication for about a year. I've been taking antidepressants since last August, but I had multiple, multi-week interruptions in January and at the beginning of this month. This most recent time, I was also off the anti's as well.

Needless to say, my brain chemistry was all kinds of fucked. I had a bit of a breakdown at work and talked to HR because I was a giant mess. I told her about my mental health issues and that I was (unwillingly) off my medications. I didn't want to do this, but thankfully it's a small business that actually gives a shit about their employees. She asked if my boss knew (he didn't) and asked if I would like to keep it that way (I said yes).

I've been contemplating letting my boss know though. He's not a micromanager at all, so it's possible he didn't even notice a difference in me lately but my work definitely hasn't been up to par.

So I want to let him know that if he had any concerns, he can lay them to rest as I'm back on my medications... But if he didn't notice, well, I'd rather not bring attention to it then.

I think I'm just tired of having to "hide" a part of who I am because it is so often misdiagnosed, especially in today's youth. Most people just don't understand, can't understand. It's frustrating.

Do you guys tell your bosses? Do you think I should? </TEXT>

<TEXT> http://i.imgur.com/xSgJopE.jpg

**TL;DR** The joke was "Affordable Care Cat" was a type-o someone made and I wanted to draw it. But I accidentally wrote "AAC" instead of "ACC", the initials, and didn't realize my mistake until I had completely finished.

---

I've been slowly teaching myself how to draw over the past month or two. Very slowly. I've always been a cut above average, I think, but never took the time to learn to get better. I'm trying to change that as I learn how much my ADD, depression, and simply my own poor mental attitude impacts my work and I'm trying to correct this. Instead of crumpling up a picture as soon as I make a mistake, roll with the punches. Finish it. You'll never get better if you quit immediately and it's unrealistic to expect perfection the first time. Why do I subject myself to such standards?

This is me trying to lower my standards, in healthy ways. This is the first drawing I've done in a week and the first time I've tried to draw something "cartoony" rather than as accurately as I can.

 A person in my buddy's office accidentally mistyped the 'Affordable Care Act' as 'Affordable Care Cat', and it became a running joke and "mascot" for the day and I wanted to draw the cat... but yea, fucked up on lots of things. Most importantly, I wrote "AAC" instead of "ACC" which I didn't even realize was wrong until I finished. Thought it was funny and figured maybe I'd share it... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm looking to get a second car, $7K absolute max. I found a pretty nice looking 2001 330ci for $4900 on Craigslist, but it has 205K miles.

I'll only be driving this vehicle on the weekends in the summer (I live in Buffalo), can't imagine it'll see more than 4K miles per year. I have zero mechanical skills, no tools, and on-street parking so I'll likely be going to a mechanic for any and all repairs.

On the upside, since this would just be as toy, any repairs won't Need to be addressed... But at the same time, if I'm paying for a toy, I want it available when I want it.

Other options I found was an '87 350E with 88K miles for $4K and a n '87 325is with an undisclosed amount of miles for $5500. I'm not familiar with what the difference between the two is to be 100% honest with you guys, but at the very least I can say that an E30 is kind of a "dream car" of mine-- I'd love to buy one and learn to wrench on it. Nice older car, lots of room in the engine bay, minimal electronics.

An E30 is one of my "dream project cars. I have zero mechanical knowledge and would love to get something to fix up and learn on so this might be a good option.

The second car I'm looking at is a 2001 330ci M-Sport in white with I *think* 200K miles but the post is written weird; it just says "205k fromNC to NY"-- can't imagine what else he's referring to. Also manual. $4900.

I used to own a 350Z but sold it for a number of reasons and thought I could be a mature responsible adult and deal with a boring practical car so I bought a new Honda Fit. And I really don't like it.

So I'm looking for a new car to drive 2-3 days per week, tops, in the summer. Still use the Fit probably Monday - Thursday.

What do you guys think? I want a fun RWD sporty car. Something I can throw into corners.

I set a filter on CL for RWD, $7K max. After scrolling through a hundred early 2000's Mustangs I found these BMWs and a 300ZX (though it's not the TT model I believe so I'm much less interested-- also frankly the 300's are my least favorite Z car).

Looking for something that won't break the bank. I suspect the '01 will :( </TEXT>

I have been diagnosed with depression and ADD, currently not taking the medication for either because I've been having trouble with my nurse.

A few months back a girl told me my haircut looked nice and my immediate reaction is, "Yea I know it looks terrible, but thanks for trying to make me feel better about it". I mean, i just smiled and said, "Thanks", but in my head that's what I was thinking. Or any time I'm walking around the city if I see someone smile in my direction I assume I'm unaware of something. Is my hair sticking up? My fly down? Eh, I'm just a goofy looking son of a bitch, whatever.

A few weeks ago, a coworker copy-pasted a conversation she had with another coworker to me. The other guy basically said to her, "I respect /u/subject721, he's a great programmer and a good guy" yet I feel completely the contrary and reading it kind of makes me feel... Hollow? Fake? I feel like it's not true, and because he's not a programmer himself I don't feel like his comments are valid. Also I got laid off from my last job, and the job before that shortly before I quit my boss spoke to me and expressed concern he felt like the quality of my work then compared to when I started had dropped (and I would agree).

Yesterday, I received a message from one of my two best friends. Known him for probably almost 7 years now, since college, but I moved away almost 3 years ago. The TL:DR was basically, "I miss you and look up to you" and I just feel guilty. He also struggles with depression / ADD (though has been steadily medicated for a while) and I've always felt bad moving away, I feel like I could have helped him more. But I think we also had a sort of co-dependent, somewhat unhealthy friendship. I mean we did absolutely everything together, went everywhere together etc. and as much as I love the bastard, I think our unhealthy tendencies fueled each other's bad behaviors. Combined with other things I didn't like about my social life and my career, I had to get out of that state. Moved 400 miles to live with my other best friend.

The other day, I showed my other best friend (my roommate, now that I moved away from home) something I had painted and he's like, "You did a really good job on this" but all I can see is parts that came out wrong, things I don't like etc. He kind of yelled at me when I pointed out what I screwed up on, he just said "love yourself!". I know he's right... But I don't know how. I feel like I'm not capable of it.

I just have this habit of dissecting everything, looking for flaws, things I could've done better, things I don't like. In everything I do-- from looking in the mirror, to my job, to my hobbies. I'm relentlessly unforgiving and nothing is enough but I don't know how to stop or change. Like picking at a scab. I just tumble down these rabbit holes of negativity, but instead of fixing or changing or improving those things I don't like I just let them be.


I talked a little about this during my last session with my therapist, but she's been busy with clients and I haven't been able to schedule appointments as regularly as I'd like. Also March was just an absolutely crazy month and I had a lot of stuff I wanted to talk about in addition to that... But yea... I'm just so tired of actively rejecting compliments, disliking with everything I do, but I can't seem to stop it. What the fuck is wrong with me :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> I desperately need a new pair of shoes. I have 2 pairs of nice dress shoes, sneakers for the gym / physical activity. My "daily" does are some more "dress-looking" cheap pair I bought at Walmart years ago, when I used to work in a restaurant. There plain, black, fake leather looking.

I prefer that sort of style, like casual dress shoes if that makes sense? But I have no idea what are actual quality brands. I have bad feet and I'd like to actually get something good instead of a random cheap pair from wherever, but I have no idea what brands are actual worth the money... </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been diagnosed at a fairly young age (I honestly don't remember, middle-school maybe?) But I stopped taking the medication after a year or two. I'm out of college now and A year ago I got re-diagnosed because I was afraid it was effecting my job, now I've been taking it regularly and seeing a therapist.

Lately I've been "hobby hopping" a lot. I find something new, I get really into it, surf the internet for information / content, start to do it, then before long I'm disinterested.

In the past 6 months I got really into fencing, drawing, game development (I'm a software engineer by day), going to the gym, play video games, reading... But before long I drop most of these hobbies for one reason or the other.

Honestly I find it frustrating, but I don't know if I'm just going through a sort of "self exploratory" phase in my mid-20's, if this is common with ADD, both, or what.

Any of you guys find yourself constantly jumping from one thing to another, but not in an immediate sense like typically associated with ADHD? More over the period of a few days, maybe a week or two.

It's just been tremendously frustrating lately. I feel the need to do stuff, I feel like I'm capable of really "doing something" with my life... I just can't stick with anything long enough to do anything, and I don't understand why I can't keep things going for long :( </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A few months ago I thought I could do the responsible thing and buy an efficient, boring ecobox. I picked up a Honda Fit, but 3.5 months later and I'm just so unhappy with it.

I was looking around online and a dealership near me has 2 brand new FiST's in, one for $20K and one for $24K. I really want the $24K one (Molten Orange, sun roof, better seats) but that might not be in my budget.

Fortunately for me, because I JUST bought a new car, I really don't need a new one-- so they can't "pressure me" or anything, and they're a high-volume dealership chain. One of the largest in the region, so maybe they're OK with smaller margins. I'd say the chips are in my hand. But I'm curious what you guys paid for yours, compared to MSRP?

Would it be realistic to hopefully talk them down to $22, do you guys think? Between the loss on the Fit, it's really not a *smart* decision, but I could afford to and the smart decision doesn't make me happy so... </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've completed the Roll a Ball, Space Shooter, Survival tutorials and I'm about half way through the Tanks tutorial.

But I feel like all of these just show me things Unity are capable of. Providing me a handful of assets and scripts and telling me how to hook things up together doesn't actually teach me anything, I just feel like they are cool, quick tech demos meant to sell their product ("Look how fast and easy this!") rather than actually teaching me anything.

I have almost 4 years of real world business programming under my belt, as well as my BS in software engineering, so it's not like I'm just some dummy who picked it up on a whim and expected everything to be great-- I understand the depth of what I'm getting into here... But I'm really struggling to get started.

Like beyond moving a ball around a flat plane I just feel like I have direction on how to start actually doing anything.

Ultimately I want to build a SRPG sort of like FF Tactics or something along those lines-- 3D grid based map, 2D sprites, turn based action... But beyond slapping a few planes around, again, I have absolutely no idea where to go from here and all of these tutorials don't really *teach* me anything I feel like.

Like from a software dev point of view, I can loosely break down the systems that need to be developed: a system for generating maps, moving things along fixed paths on a grid, loose combat systems, selecting units, issuing command to each unit etc etc... I just have absolutely no idea how to begin, even on the most basic level.

Any tips? Please? :( </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys, I posted a few weeks ago about my troubles as a professional software developer trying to motivate myself getting into Indie game dev, having picked up Unity for a few weeks on multiple occasions.

I've poked around with Unity a little bit some more since then, but the other night me and a close friend from college seriously discussed game development and it's something we both want to do, so we're going to sit down Sunday and come up with a few short term projects and goals, and discuss my idea for a "real" project that I'd eventually like to have actually published in 5-10 years.

Anyways, the purpose of this post is simply to request suggestions for material pertaining to games from a more "software point of view". Stuff about the architectural development of a video game. I mean I understand OOP and business software (~3.5 years professional experience + college) and while a lot of it carries over to game dev, it's also a very different beast.


**TLDR:** Anyone have any good recommendations for reading in regards to the real "engineering" and mechanics side of game development? My "dream project" is a strategy / turn based RPG, so anything related to that would be ideal but I'll take anything really. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My dad travels for a living, and in the weekend he drives for a bus company just taking groups wherever. This weekend he was taking a college team from Boston to somewhere in Kentucky, dropping them off and then taking a rental car back home. Then next weekend he drives the rental back out there, picks up the team with the bus and brings 'em back.

Or at least that was the plan, anyways. Saturday evening I got a text from my brother telling me Dad is in jail, he got a DUI and totaled the rental.

What the **fuck**. My mom is pissed, hurt, disappointed... We all are.

They can't afford his bail so he's been in jail for a few days too.

I'm just genuinely speechless. A combination of "how fucking stupid", "you are royally fucked", " what are they going to do about the house", "what is Mom going to do" (he's had issues with alcohol in the past, but nothing this bad)

So... Anyone else experience some colossal parental fuck ups? What happened / how'd it play out? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I play a Dwarf Cleric of Light and recently got Meld Into Stone.

I've always just used the spell in a more gimmicky fashion; using it to avoid paying for a bedroom in an inn and things of that nature. My DM said to me it wouldn't "interrupt" my Long Rest, so hey why not!

Anyways, so last week in the campaign game, I decided to eat a mushroom that shrunk my Dwarf down to Tiny sized and I melded into a small rock after instructing the Dragonborn Barbarian to throw me at an enemy and shout, "my Clerics name, I chose you!"

Unfortunately, I failed my Perception check to hear the Barbarian-- I planned on simply un-melding and chucking a Fireball at a group of enemies. So the DM just had him make an improvised ranged attack with a small Boulder, and both me + the target suffered the damage. Then on my turn I jumped out and finished my plan.

Anyways, I was just curious on how you guys might rule this sort of use with the spell? Has anyone here been used as a projectile before? Any other fun uses for the spell? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just bought a brand new Fit the week before Christmas and I've put 2500 miles on it.

Often times when I start out in First gear, the car kind of "chugs" as if I'm not giving it enough gas, or like if I abruptly took my foot off the clutch (and then pressed it back in and let it out too quickly again).

Is this normal? I've been driving stick for probably about 6+ years now.

Initially I thought it was temperature related, mostly happens in the cold, but even after a 20 minute drive on the highway it still does it when I get off the highway and come to a redlight.

Again, it doesn't happen every time but even if it's 30% of the time that seems like it's too frequent? </TEXT>

<TEXT> A few months ago I signed up for Fencing lessons and I've been having a lot of fun with it but for a handful of reasons I've decided to stop attending class.

The biggest reason is that I don't want to spend the time it would require to "keep up" with my classmates when it comes to drilling and sparring.

I tried rock climbing when I visited a friend in a different state, but the only gym near me sucks. I've lost a lot of weight since last time I went, maybe that would help, but we'll see.

I also went snowboarding for the first time in 9+ years the other weekend, which was fun but is expensive :/

I dislike the gym, but have been making myself go. I'd much rather some sort of activity, or activities, for exercise instead. Just need something I can do at my leisure, yet still preferably with people. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I started fencing in October. Full disclosure, I was tremendously depressed and started taking antidepressants and seeing a therapist + counselor a month or two prior.

I initially signed up for class for a few reasons:

* get back in shape to go snowboarding in the winter
* meet people
* just generally try new things

I do enjoy fencing, I had a lot of fun with the beginner class and there were 1 or 2 decent people my age, and honesty I think it did a lot to help "kick-start" my confidence / help with the depression.

But lately as I've joined the Intermediate class I just feel like I'm not keeping up, holding others back during drills and just generally get my butt whooped in bouts. I don't mind losing, but I don't feel like I'm progressing. And perhaps most importantly, I fucking hate directing and the coach often has us do directed bouts. It's partly tied to my confidence issues, but even that aside I just don't like it and am not good at it.

I'm supposed to have class tonight, but lately I just can't get motivated to go. If I could just do my own thing, hey cool whatever I don't mind being bad. But like I said, when I consistently fuck up drills and such I just feel bad for messing up the other dude's "rhythm".

Then just in general, half the class is highschool students and the other half is generally younger college kids (I graduated a few years ago) and just don't really "get on" with anyone there. The coach is a decent dude but even that is pretty shallow.

I dunno, I feel like I want to quit but I also feel like my reasons for doing so are kind of weak, if that makes sense? </TEXT>

Lately I've been exploring other Creative hobbies and I kind of want to revisit game dev but I already know what's going to happen; aspirations will be too high, I won't even come close to meeting them, get frustrated and call or quits after 3 weeks.

I realize very few games are created in such a short window, barring random weekend game jam projects, but I've just always struggled with this sort of motivation / discipline.

Do you guys have any "exercises" to help you keep on trucking and follow through with things? I would really like to finish a project one day, I don't care if it's successful or not, but yea...

Edit: Should've probably been more clear; while I know what a game jam *is* my skillset isn't even at the level where I could participate and even contribute. Yea I write code, but I'm just not even familiar enough with the tools to really do anything. It's like each time I re-install Unity, I need to go look up the absolute basics all over again. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Would it be realistic to consider buying a house with $80K debt? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-10 16:57:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Quick facts:

* 25M
* Single
* New York state (WNY)
* $62K/yr with a pretty stable job
* $63K in various student loans ranging from 3.4% - 8.8%
* $14K owed on a new car (2%)
* Contribute 4% to my retirement account

Currently, I rent a 3br with two other dudes. This costs me about $400/mo between rent + utilities. $240 on my car payment and about $1,000 in student loans. Plus all the other expenses; car insurance, groceries, spending money etc.

I want to start considering buying a home and ideally I'd have enough for a small down payment by the end of the year. Where I live houses are extremely cheap, but the taxes are high from what I've told and I don't really understand them.

You can get an OK starter home with 2-3 BR, 1BA and maybe a garage for around $70-100K depending on the region, but this would also be like an 80 year old house.

You can get a much nicer, newer home (~40 years old) for 150-200K.

I'd much rather buy a good home I plan on living in for a long time, rather than buying a cheaper, crappier "first home" with the intent of selling it and getting something nicer in 10 years. But this of course would be much more expensive month to month. And it'd be more difficult to come up with the down payment for a $150K home than an $80K one

I've tried googling property tax codes for the various suburbs but I seriously don't understand what I'm reading. School zone taxes? Other taxes based on the value of the house? Etc...

Then there's insurance, saving you for when something breaks, general spending money and so on.

Can anyone here tell me more about the "real" cost of buying and owning a home? A coworker said I should probably expect to spend $1000 more per month than I already do on my rent. Is that realistic?

I do plan on setting up an appointment with a realtor, I imagine they'd be able to give me the best, most accurate information but I also don't want to waste time if it's pretty obviously a bad idea or whatever. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Can I get some input on starting up going to the gym again? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-09 22:02:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys, so a year ago or so I lost about 50 pounds almost exclusively by dieting. I started walking about it 3 miles most days per week this past summer, but the winter / holiday season and a sort of "relapse" in my personal life and I put 15 pounds back on. So I went from 215 -- 165 -- 180.

I said enough is enough and went to the gym yesterday for the first time in well over a year. I did about an hour of weight lifting. Hit a few upper body machines and a few lower body ones.

My predicament is a fairly busy schedule. On the week days, I can only go to the gym Monday, Wednesday and Friday. However, I have a Fencing class (just started a few months ago) on Thursday evenings, and open sparring on Saturdays.

So my plan is to do weights on Monday so that my body is isn't a limp noodle during fencing, and to do Cardio on Wed + Fri.

Saturday like I said is fencing and evenings I'm generally busy with friends, then Sunday is recovery / chores so I don't want to do anything then.

Right now my main goal is weight loss. I'm more of an endomorph, even when I was in really good shape (regular "extreme" sports + track + ate healthy) I was never lean, always just been kind of a thicker dude.

Currently I'm 5'8", 180 and I want to get down to 160, then from there bulk up a little bit maybe around 170ish.

Just wanted some more experienced peoples' opinions: should my planned exercise regiment be effective for my goals, assuming I can curtail my poor eating habits? If not, what do you think might be better, while maintaining respect to my fencing days? Thanks. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What are your thoughts on trading in a brand new car for a slightly used one that's more fun? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-05 16:56:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I guess you guys will be more biased towards getting something Fun, but i thought I'd ask. Just before Christmas, I bought a new Fit. I test drove a handful of other cars in the market but ultimately decided on the Fit for 3 reasons:

* Awesome MPG 
* Neat fold-up rear seats, the car is crazy spacious for a compact
* Brand New was in my budget (I know you lose a lot of money and often times this doesn't make the most sense, but I wanted something with a perfectly clean history that I did not have to worry about)
* Thought I'd do the "responsible" thing and forego a toy because I have $63K in student debt and live downtown / on street parking, didn't want a car I really care about in case it gets damaged

So, those are my reasons. Fast forward a little more than a month and 2,000 miles later, I don't *hate* the car, but the A pillars are goddamn awful and it's just such an anemic, boring lifeless box. I miss driving something fun, something I look forward to getting into.

Car was about $18K, around $20K after tax and fees. I put about $6K down on it.

I checked cars.com and autotrader and I've found a few Fiesta ST's for $17-18K.

I'm wondering if anyone here has done this? How does it work? Should I try to privately sell the Fit, pay off the loan, get the title, then buy the Fiesta?

Or would I be better off / easier to just trade in the Fit? I know you lose ~10%, but it's brand new so hopefully they wouldn't fuck me too bad on trade in? Or am I just being dumb and still "getting over" my 350Z? I miss being able to pass cars when needed, accelerate as I desire, take a corner without feeling like it's going to roll over on me.

Edit: I think you guys are right. Considering my financial situation, I'm just going to sit on the Fit for a while. Plenty of time to own a car I really like when I'm debt free :/ </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is it just me, or has NewEgg declined in quality over the years? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-29 15:32:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I built my first PC almost 10 years ago, and every time I've built one I order almost exclusively from NewEgg.

Recently, my roommate ordered a 27" IPS (Asus) from NewEgg and it had a dead pixel. He got the, "talk to the manufacturer" run-around for a bit before NewEgg finally sent him a second one... Which also had problems. More, "It's out of our hands, talk to Asus" from the rep. In the end he did get a third replacement from NewEgg and that's been OK.

Just last night now I went to buy an SSD + new monitor. The monitor was $41 cheaper on Amazon, and Prime eligible. The SSD was the same price. I wanted to open a NewEgg card and put it on that so I could finance it 0% interest, and NewEgg doesn't charge tax in my state whereas Amazon does.

Anyways, so I contact their customer support and they said they'll price match the monitor, but their price match is not a refund but rather simply they give you store credit. I was on the fence about buying two monitors, but the rep told me they cannot price match multiple quantities. So I'd still pay that $40 premium for the second one if I wanted it. In addition to NewEgg store credit being nearly worthless to me, as I rarely ever buy from them between Amazon being as cheap / cheaper, free 2-day shipping, and I have an Amazon card for points and they actually sell other stuff so I'm far more likely to use the credit with them.

Additionally, they're Prime eligible so I'd get free two-day shipping or $4 one day. NewEgg said they'd give me free 3-day shipping.

Ultimately, I decided to pull the trigger and just get one as I really don't *need* two.

So I sign up for the NewEgg card, check out and place my order. Give the order number to the sales rep to process the price match guarantee and he tells me the sale was cancelled. Stupid me, I forgot to change my Shipping / Billing info, it was still saved to my old address and the card I just opened had my new address. My mistake. But the rep wasn't able to modify that info and try again. I had to cancel the order, and place it a second time with the correct info. And now I can't place the transaction because my credit is exceeded because of the failed transaction previously. Call up their bank and they can't do anything for me because it's such a new account they don't have it in their system yet.

I fully acknowledge that last part is entirely my own fault, but honestly I have to say the whole experience wasn't great. Between how much they've stepped up their spam promo emails, the issues my friend had and a less than great experience trying to make an $800 purchase I've lost a lot of respect for them.

Anyone else feel NewEgg has gotten bigger but not better over the years? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Guys, how do you handle obvious physical flaws / "the elephant in the room"? Particularly with regards to dating / dating profiles </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-28 19:33:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When I was 11 years old or so, I knocked out my front tooth in a rollerblading accident. I had it reinserted, got braces, then when those came off the tooth came with it. Issuance wouldn't cover it.

For a while I had a fake tooth attached to my retainer, but as I got older I stopped wearing that because it was uncomfortable, difficult to clean, and generally just really inconvenient.

I was extremely insecure for a while about the missing tooth, American culture loves a pretty smile. I've gotten over it mostly, but not completely.

I find I don't really know how to "handle" it though, I've tried making jokes about it but usually don't get many laughs-- maybe the jokes are just bad, but I also wonder if others pick up on my insecurities about it and maybe I'm just making it awkward. Do I just ignore it unless asked?

It's particularly a problem I'm having with dating, I guess. I've never been explicitly told that's why someone wasn't into me, but I'm sure it doesn't help my case. Also, I don't know how to talk about it on a dating profile. I want to be upfront about it, don't want to be like those people who have nothing but photos of themselves 50 pounds lighter. But at the same time, I feel like I'm kind of gimping myself by throwing it out there.

Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if I had a cool story to go along with it, but oh well.

Any of you guys have thoughts on this issue? Or, if you have any obvious flaws that sort of command attention like that, how do you handle it? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been in dire need of a vacation lately, and I was thinking maybe in the Fall this year I'd like to drive from WA to CA. Ideally, fly in from the east coast, pick up a car in WA and drop it off in CA. Is that doable, or do you have to actually drop it off where you got it / at least in the same state? Additionally, what's the likelihood of renting something with at least a V6, convertible and manual? I can't imagine a lot of rental places would meet those three criteria.

I was planning on doing maybe 5 days, seems like that's ample time for the drive and to make stops whenever, but I could make a full week of it. Get in on a Saturday, leave on a Sunday.

I've looked around online but all I can find are galleries / articles about peoples' trips rather than any actual information to plan the trip...

So, if anyone here has done this or is knowledgeable about it, I'd really appreciate hearing anything you have to say </TEXT>

So if Haunt deals 4000% damage over 12 seconds, does it now deal 4K over 6, or 8K over 12?

Additionally, how does this tie in with that Passive that makes things last "almost forever"? That's so vague.

I guess however you split it, the math will come out the same but I was just wondering if there's any more trickery going on there + with Jade Harvester dealing 150 seconds worth of damage than one might immediately think. </TEXT>

My gear isn't great, but it's manageable. I think I want to aim for the Wormwood staff, because having to cast Locust Swarm is expensive mana wise.

But I also really want to gamble rings to get that one that rotates between the elements.

I think it might make more sense to go for the ring, because if I spend all my shards on 2H weapons and get one that doesn't have good stats and a Socket I'll be pretty unhappy. Whereas if I get the ring and it's not perfect, well, you're really just using it for the effect anyways.

<TITLE> NRE on a client's machine that I cannot reproduce   ASCII values? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-20 15:09:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys, my employer contracted another company to rewrite our ASP.NET app from VB to C#.

They're getting an NRE when they click a button which performs this code (sorry for formatting, I'm on mobile):

`For pIntCount = 65 To 73`

`pObjTier = CType(Me.FindControl("txtTier"   Chr(pIntCount)), TextBox)`

`pStrXml  = pObjTier.Attributes.Item("someValueSetInOtherMethod").ToString`

`Next`

So we loop over a few letters and concatenate values to an XML string. I was told that "`pObjTier.Attributes.Item("someValueSetInOtherMethod") ` returns `Nothing`". But I am completely unable to reproduce this behavior on my machine, whole thing runs fine.

The only I idea I have is that an email I received from this company has a lot of out-of-place accented characters (such as " Navigate to Reports**** Profile Reports"). I'm wondering if it's possible their is some bizarre issue with how the integers might be converted to a char if English isn't the default language on their computers? I know little about this and I'd be very surprised if this is actually what's happening.

**Edit**: To clarify, two methods are called from a button click. One assigns a numeric value or an empty string to that Attribute for each text box from a DB call. Then the method I posted the snippet is fired directly after. So there shouldn't be any issues with post backs or anything of that nature. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have two roommates. One I've known for more than a decade, and he's a mutual friend of the other roommate who I didn't know as well prior to living with them. Those two lived together all of college, so they've known each other 6-7 years. I played video games online with him, so I've probably known him about 4 years / lived with for 2.

The one I've known for a shorter period is moving out to live with his GF this year, he told us last year. My roommate and I can't afford a 3BR split 2 ways, but because we all smoke we're extremely apprehensive about finding a random person to live with us via Reddit / Craigslist. We also really don't want to move, absolutely love where we live but our apartment is about as cheap as it gets for the area. $1100 for a 3BR, a new apartment complex just went up 1 block away and it's $1300 for 2BR's.

Has anyone here done found a random roommate? It's decriminalized in the state, but even still we're not thrilled about the idea of having a random person move in with marijuana in the apartment. How did it go for you? We're young, employed business professionals, but obviously not all smokers are. Afraid of finding someone who does smoke, worried about having weed stolen, needing to secure it, who they might bring over etc... </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys, I have a few years experience developing Windows applications and some web development, but I've never done anything too sophisticated.

I recently moved downtown, I've never lived directly in the heart of a city before and parking sucks. What I want to do is to buy some sort of device, I assume it must exist, just like a range finder and point it out my window at the street. I can use this to determine if there are open parking spots directly in front of my apartment, or if they're all taken.

Then I could just write something for my phone that will use GPS data to ping this device when I reach a certain location close to home, saving me the hassle of having to circle around the entire block (all 1-way streets) and miss other spots.

I was just wondering if you guys have done anything like this or might know how I could begin to do it?

Other, similar ideas i had would be to either:

* Simply set it to a timer, rather than location based. Then I could just have the device send out an email and remove the need to develop a phone application

* Text / email a photo, removing the need to find a specialized device

I figure I could probably hook up whatever I buy to a raspberry pi and then do everything from there.

Haven't been in a relationship in 4 years at this point, and even that was an LDR so it kind of doesn't even count.

Anyways, talking to my roommate today he said his girl was "pretty devastated", to use his words, and that "she knows about you and how big of a step it is and she was rooting for you". I thought this was really odd, while she comes over multiple times per week I've hardly said more than a few words to her, they spend most of their time in his room. So I know very little about her, was just really surprised he would go into such intimate, personal detail. They've really hit it off and bonded a ton, talk a lot, not just a fling or anything.

I want something that's almost like the texture and weight of resume paper, just obviously much larger than standard 8.5x11 paper. Probably at least 4x that, I think, so as to not lose quality when printing. Then I was thinking of maybe pouring little bits of coffee on it to stain it, and maybe burn the edges a little?

Now that I think about it, maybe I could simple take multiple pieces of paper, print segments onto it, then "scar" the edges with a lighter / stain it all, then sort of stitch it back together with some small rope / thread maybe? I have no real experience with any sorts of arts   crafts kind of thing unfortunately.

Something *like* this: http://jackieocean.deviantart.com/art/Treasure-Map-Project-39039691

except actually stained and tattered, just not printed to look that way. And again, much larger format. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> TL;DR My parents unintentionally treat me like a child, baby me, and just generally get on my nerves without even knowing they're doing it. I need to talk to them when I go home to visit fit the holiday weekend, but I've always been awful at talking about really personal stuff like this, let alone on such an important Holiday. How the hell can I talk with them, and do you guys think I should talk Christmas Eve (not an eventful day in my family) or wait until the day after?


---------

I've never been good at talking about serious stuff with my parents, or people in general. I get along well with with my mom, and I know my dad loves me and I love him but I don't really like him.

My dad especially treats me like a child, my mom always tries to protect and take care of me. "Momma knows best" sort of thing, I guess. And I always feel guilty whenever I see them, as I moved far away.

I love them both and I know they have my best interest in mind but it's truly just... Suffocating. I honestly gave myself a headache just thinking about visiting this Christmas weekend.

I'm trying to figure out how to handle this weekend. Should I talk to them Thursday? But I don't want to make them mad or feel bad the day before Christmas. But I also don't really want to put up with their shit for 3-5 days either.

I don't even know what to say, either. I just feel like my dad thinks I'm 5, not 25 with how he explains shit or tells me what to do. Like just the other day, he told me to make sure I wrap the Christmas gifts I got my mom. I know it's a super unimportant example but it's just like wtf? No shit. Bought a car this weekend, I texted him prior to it and he's like "Don't let them talk you into buying anything you don't need!" once again.. I appreciate the sentiment, but I'm not a fucking retard. I know to not buy shit I don't need. Or before that, while trying to decide which car I even wanted he kept trying to steer me away from things I want and kept urging me to buy a Corolla. Third time, I'm a fucking adult and I can make my own decisions.

Last time I visited them, my dad started to elaborate on a horror story, I guess you could say, that my brother experienced while over seas for the military but my mom cut him off and said something like "he doesn't need to hear this!" And it's just like, I read the news. I've heard stories, I have friends in the military. I can decide for myself if I want to hear something or not.

Then as I said, with the guilt. I know they love me, but when they say things like "I missed you so much" I just feel like shit, or my mom crying when I leave. 

I know that no matter what I do, no matter how old I'll get, I'll always be a kid to my parents but lately it's suffocating and I think these behaviors largely influenced my serious lack of confidence, indecisiveness and a bunch of other personal problems. I just have *no* idea how to approach this topic with them. Again, I know they love me and mean well but I just can't stand it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Shortly after Thanksgiving, I went down to a Honda dealership to test drive a new 2016 Fit. They didn't have an MT of the trim package I wanted, but they said they'd order one from the factory in Japan.

Today I got a voicemail telling me they got an MT in earlier this month and have been unable to order new MTs, so they can't / haven't been able to order one in the color I wanted but I could have this one they have if I wanted it.

I didn't think much of it, figured manuals are less popular so Honda just isn't making more right now. My roommate thinks it sounds shady as fuck. What do you guys think? </TEXT>

<TEXT> * Boots, while slightly slower, are much cheaper.

* Diffusal Blade has more Intelligence, and with Glaives no longer being a UAM this could be a great option for Purge and attack speed.

* Dragon Lance is going to be a huge item this patch, with the ability to be disassembled into BKB and Orchid / Butterfly components it's a great option. Additionally, Silencer specifically can trade like few others with Glaives of Wisdom- now you can do it further away, and faster.

* Glaives of Wisdom, speak of the devil! It's no longer a UAM.

* New Arcane Curse. It damages creeps, so it can help you farm early where able. He currently is a really bad farmer unless you have a great start and get a few stacks of Intelligence and quick gold it can be difficult.

I'm sure I'm missing a few other things worth mentioning, but just a few things jumped at me. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Something I thought of while taking to a friend, what if heroes could attack Tusk's Snowball to break it and have the hero(es) inside pop out like a pinata?

The spell is great for engaging, all they can do is run away or try to get into a better position for the fight. Defensively, there is absolutely nothing that can be done to stop Snowball from saving allies until Grave comes off cooldown or backup arrives.

I understand a lot of this boils down to positioning, vision, and silences / lock down but it's clear this spell is a little too effective.

At max rank, Supernova requires 11 attacks to pop but bird also has her Fire Spirits with insane attack speed reduction, and a DOT. Tusk also has Sigil for attack speed reduction, which may or may not be better. So I'm not sure what would be a good number for Snowball.

I think that this change, perhaps in addition to base Int, Int growth per level, and or Mana cost modifications could make him a little bit less of a superstar without going too overboard.

What do you guys think? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I went down to a dealership after Thanksgiving and ordered a new car from the factory as there was nothing within a 100 mile radius that met my requirements.

They said they'd handle the paperwork for securing a loan, and today I got a letter in the mail from a bank (coincidentally, the bank I use) saying my request on behalf of %dealership was denied for the following reasons:

* Number of major derogatory accounts and or public records.

What the fuck does that mean? I got 2 speeding tickets this year, that's the only thing I can possibly think of but how the hell would the bank know? What else could "derogatory accounts or public records" mean?

Further below, it lists my credit score, which is pretty darn good.

I've just paid off my last car 3 years early, I make excellent money but do have a lot of student loans (I pay about about ~25% of my **pre-tax** income in student loans). That's the only reason I could think of; high existing debt, but I do pay it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Which monitor(s) are right for me? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've got a pretty old 24" Acer, 1680x1050 as my secondary display and a 27" Asus 1920x1080 as the primary display. Both TN panels.

I'd like to buy 2x of the same monitor and replace both of my existing ones, rather than buy a new primary and replace the secondary with my current primary.

I game a lot, general web browsing, and will periodically watch movies on the computer from my bed which is about 9 or 10 feet away, and my bed is much lower than where the monitor sits.

IPS is a must, even just sitting at my desk the TN has really really bad color distortion around the edges of the screen.

I'm having a tough time deciding on size and resolution. I like the 27", it's a great blend of "Large and immersive" without being so big that I can't see all 4 corners well. But I also sort of want something a little bigger for when I'm in bed.

Additionally, I'd like a higher resolution just for gaming but I only have a single GTX 970. Not sure how well that would like 2560x1440 or higher.

I don't have an exact budget in mind, but I'd like to keep it under a grand for the two of 'em.

I was looking at the Dell U2715H. It meets all of my criteria, but at $430 it's definitely pushing the absolute upper limit. The Dell P2725Q is 4K, but costs $500 and would exacerbate the performance concerns for my GPU. Additionally, there isn't a lot of 4K content so i think 4K might feel "under utilized". Also I hear Windows doesn't look great at that resolution / monitor size.

Can anyone recommend some slightly cheaper alternatives that meet my demands?

Or perhaps I should just say to hell with buying 2, just get one really nice one and save the money? Bah. Decisions... </TEXT>

Some days following a class, I have such a stiff, sore neck from standing / looking sideways and I think just the weight of the mask might factor in, too.

I don't think I stand "too" sideways, but watching some of the other fencers some of them look like they take a little bit more of a forward-facing stance.

Anyways, is there anything I can do to prevent this soreness, or something to help ease the pain the following day? I'm trying to drink more water, I know I don't get enough, but other than that + some painkillers is there any exercises or stretches I could do? </TEXT>

<TITLE> My body / muscles shake a lot whenever I do anything remotely physically intensive. How can I control this? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-07 21:18:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For as long as I can remember, I feel like I've never had good control over my body but I guess I just always thought it was normal to some degree.

One time, like a decade ago, in highschool I had to demonstrate some exercise and I remember hearing someone comment on how much my arms were shaking while holding the position. I wasn't nervous, and I was in good physical shape. I just can't help it, my arms and even torso sometimes just shake a lot while doing stuff.

If I try to do push ups slowly, my arms shake after like 5. I can probably do about 15 if I go slow, or 20-30 if I go at a "normal" pace.

Earlier this summer at a waterfall / swimming hole another guy there asked if I was OK because my arms were shaking when I had to climb over / around a large rock to get to a ledge to jump off. Another instance of having to do something slowly while I feel around with my hands and feet, trying to figure out how best to get around it.

Just this past weekend at fencing practice (I'm new) a guy I was sparring with told me "the nervousness / shakiness go away" but that's just how I've always been. Even my legs just feel shaky if I have to hold a crouched sort of position long.

My hands shake a lot too, more than most I'd say.

Is there something I can do while exercising to "tighten" control and improve this? I've always disliked it, but why those two incidents this year I think I'm becoming more and more insecure about it :/

I guess the best way to describe it is just... Feeling weak. As if I'm really staining my body to do whatever it is I'm asking of it. Even just propping myself up with my arms on the armrest of my chair for a little bit. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm 25, I've known this girl (24) (don't know her very well) for about a year. We hang out with the same large gaming group / "club" and have talked a decent amount over the past year, but nothing serious or anything. Truthfully, she only just learned my name a few weeks ago-- but she is awful with everyone's names, and often times most people call each other by their D D characters names.

She's been in and out of 3 relationships since I've known her, but I don't know many details of why they ended or anything like that. This is a bit  of a red flag for me. Additionally, she works multiple jobs (busy schedule) and doesn't seem to have many prospects for future earning. The former is definitely a negative and I haven't decided on the latter. I absolutely don't mind paying for dates, but I don't want to feel like I have to either.

I guess that, given she only just learned my name, she's most likely not interested in me and I should just forget it, but now that she's single again I'm wondering if I should give it a shot and ask her on a date.

Despite the flags, for some reason I can't stop myself from thinking about asking her out. I don't know if I just need to get laid (it's been a while), if I'm genuinely interested, if I'm just looking for reasons to *not* pursue her (I'm not exactly the healthiest person mentally). Additionally, hypothetically, say she actually said yes and things go OK. If and when they go south, could be awkward if I wanted to continue hanging out with the D D group. I initially joined solely to make friends and meet people, so it'd kind of suck to lose the closest thing I have to friends beyond my roommates. I don't hang out with anyone there beyond the one or two days per week the group gets together and I don't often talk with any of them much outside the get-togethers, either.


A long term friend of hers on Saturday commented something her attracting shitty guys or something along those lines. Would it be weird if I asked her (the mutual friend) for more info? That seems pretty weird to me but I don't "get" people at all.

Just wondering if any other dudes have encountered a situation where you felt like you shouldn't be interested in someone but yet often found yourself thinking about them? What'd you do and how'd it go? </TEXT>

<TEXT> While waiting for my new Fit to arrive from the factory, I've been thinking a lot about it. This morning, I was in front of / next to a car with really bright headlights. It made me wonder how the Lane Watch camera works in those kinds of situations.

I don't want to turn my directional on at 7AM while it's still dark out and then have a blinding light beam the cabin as the touch screen auto displays whatever that camera gets.

Do they have a "night vision" mode where it's not as bright?

Also, how's the back up camera at night? And thinking of that, do the reverse lights provide much light on the new models? My old Corolla had a good amount of light back there to make the surroundings more visible while reversing. My 350Z does not at all-- as if it's not already hard enough to see in that thing. </TEXT>

Problem is, I suspect there won't be a lot of demand for this kind of car given it's December. So I want to try and start selling it ASAP. But this could leave me without a vehicle for an unknown period of time depending on how fast it sells and when the new one arrives.

I was considering just buying a cheap ass $1K beater on Craigslist and then re-sell it once the new vehicle arrives but I'm not sure how much of a pain in the ass that'd be, between the DMV, insurance, dealing with the title and everything...

Anyways, all 3 days this week (M-W) my alarm has failed to wake me up in the morning when I set my phone to DND / Alarms Only before bed.

Last night I figured I was just accidentally disabling my alarm in a half-asleep stupor in the morning, so I put my phone on my desk across the room instead of next to my bed on my nightstand. Nope, over slept again today and my alarm never went off.

I just set an alarm for a minute into the future with Alarm Only active, and it DID make noise. I see there's an Alarm volume slider now, which is all the way up.

I've been using Alarm Clock Xtreme, I think tonight I'll try using the stock alarm / clock app instead, or if anyone here has another suggestion that'd be good too.

Any other info you guys need? Or ideas? PEBKAC?

<TITLE> Question and Counter Attacks   Right of Way </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-01 19:53:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Wikipedia defines a Counter Attack as so:

 Counter-Attack

 An attack made against, or into, an attack initiated by the opponent. In foil and sabre, a counter-attack does not have the right-of-way against the opponents initiated attack. Counter-attacking is a common tactic in pe, where one may gain a touch by hitting first, and avoiding the opponents attack. Counter-attacks, especially in pe, are often accompanied by an action on the blade (beat, opposition, prise-de-fer, transfer).

If a CA doesn't have right of way, what's the point? You can't score a touch with it, right? If my opponent lunges, and I have a longer reach and lunge back and land a touch first it won't count right? Is it used in response when you're not in position to parry / follow-up well, and you simply hope they respond to your CA, which you could then in turn follow up with a "legitimate" attack that does have ROW?

I'm asking specifically in regards to foil, but still interested in hearing from the other two weapons as well. 

Thanks guys-- have my first "Intermediate" class this Thursday and Saturday, super excited to get deeper into the sport and practice with others who are more determined as my beginner class dwindled from ~16 people down to 7 by the 4th class, then 5 on our last class.

<TEXT> I know I played the original The Witcher a long time ago, but I don't remember much beyond enjoying it. I played #2 and gave up quickly, it felt clunky as hell on PC.

I picked up the third one and I'm enjoying it immensely, but I'm getting my ass WHOOPED. Maybe it's just coming from Fallout 4 where even on Survival I 2-shot everything (at most) but every boss I've encountered has taken me more than 5 tries. I have no gold to afford consumables, I can't seem to craft anything due to a lack of resources. Dismantling stuff is expensive. Repairing stuff is expensive. I wouldn't consider myself bad at video games in any sense of the word, but I find this game very challenging. Refreshingly so, it's not un-fun to play, I'm just really surprised. I'm just broke and I've died multiple times to just random mob encounters while wandering around, let alone the bosses. And yes, I've been trying to look at the Bestiary to see what things are susceptible to.

I'm only level 6, any tips / suggestions?

EDIT: Thanks for all the tips guys. Between learning Alcohol is used to re-stock potions during meditation, raiding some Bandit / Deserter Camps and significantly increasing my Quen Shield usage things have gotten MUCH more "fair". Fucking awesome game and I'm so glad I picked it up and played it after Fallout 4, blowing that game out of the water. </TEXT>

But when I compiled this and passed the number 100, my list contained 49, 48, 48.

Why does Convert.ToInt16('1') give 49, and how could I fix this implementation? I guess cast `c` to a `string` then to an `int` but that seems excessive / ugly / sloppy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm 25. I have a decent, stable job writing software at a small local company that services a large industry across the country. I've been employed in-field since I graduated and have had 3 jobs since graduating. I would say I'm in a decent position, all things considered.

But I feel like I have no idea where I'm going, what I'm doing, or what I even *want*. Do I want to write code for the rest of my life? Move into a more project management role? Start my own consulting business for other small businesses? Something else entirely-- and if so, how do you even make such a huge change.

On the other side in my personal life, I have no idea what I want in a woman either. Someone with a career of their own? Someone with "lower professional aspirations" that could theoretically take care of kids or a house?

I feel like I can see the good and bad in most things, and it cripples me from making a decision either way. No idea what to do and like I'm just kind of drifting. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Anyone else doing a melee oriented playstyle? What do you think, so far? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-12 15:38:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just hit level 15 last night. I have 2 or 3 points into the STR +melee damage perk, +carrying capacity, CHA's perk that gives damage reduction and carrying capacity while solo, the LUCK perk that just gives increased damage, and finally the one that increases how much Stimpacks heal for.

I'm wearing an assortment of metal and leather armor that I've upgraded as much as I can (Blacksmith 2 / Armorsmith 1 I believe) with minimal 'Second Mods', mostly just increased armor values.

Running around with grenades, a serrated sword, pistol, shotgun, smg and hunting rifle. Primarily throw a grenade into a room, chug some Jet and run in swinging. Psycho helps a lot, too.

But I don't know. It feels a little... Limited? Not sure. I don't want to switch to guns as then I'll have wasted all the points into +melee.

What are you guys using for a weapon? Any tips on what I could or should try?

Edit; I think what the problem is is that melee weapons have so few options for mods and there's little reason to switch from one weapon to another I don't really feel like I have much to do, gear-wise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm looking for something with 3 or 5 doors, sunroof / moonroof, and a manual transmission.

AWD is a huge plus but not mandatory. The better on gas, the more desirable.

The Fit seems to be better on gas, but I think I like the styling on the Fiesta more and the options I think are a little better but I'll need to check from a desktop site instead-- the mobile configurators suck.

I'd *like* to buy brand new, but I suppose I'd also be open to something gently used. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Tips for lunging / parry drills on my own? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Had my 4th class last night, going over Parry 7   8. We've done 4 and 6 already. After practicing just 7's and just 8's against one another, coach wanted us to stitch it all together and do 4-6-7-8 against each other.

He went a little too fast for most of us, I think, and we kind of flubbed where we should have been aiming when attacking, which threw off the defender expecting to parry X and not having the attack come anywhere near appropriate for that location.. It was pretty sloppy and that was the first time I just felt *dumb* after a drill. Until now I think I've done fairly well and have made good progress both in theory and in practice.

So yea, I really need to practice this at home, but without another body to aim at-- or an attacker to defend against-- I really don't know "how" to practice, or how to gauge my form and critique it.

Any suggestions? I was honestly thinking of just getting a giant sheet of paper and tracing out a person to hang up and aim at, but beyond that... </TEXT>

One has 37K miles, the other has 29K. Both dealerships listed the vehicle for $18,995.

Both are manuals, sunroof, but the lower-mileage one has nicer looking wheels (black, many spokes instead of the silver 5-spoke look).

I like the 29K one more, but $19K is my upper maximum limit. What do you guys think I could reasonably ask for the two?

Oh, I forgot to mention the 37K one also has the red pin stripes down the hood, I really dislike that. Possible bargaining chip in addition to having the option of a lower-mileage vehicle? Could I get $15K do you think? </TEXT>

I'm shocked at how much fun I'm having, and now I'm curious about kendo as I just learned there's a school for that nearby, too.

I know even less about kendo then I do fencing, but I assume, at a high level, the only similarity is "stab them before they stab you".

Has anyone here tried both? I'm afraid I'll accidentally try to carry stuff from one school to the other and end up hurting myself more than helping. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys, I've always had a much weaker lower body than upper body. Especially since gaining a shit ton of weight and ceasing most physical activities. I've since lost all about 10, maaaaybe 15 pounds that I put on but this was entirely through dieting. Anyways, so I signed up for fencing to whip me back into shape for snowboarding this winter. I'm amazed at just how un-fit I am.

Simply holding an en garde pose and practicing advancing / retreating / lunging for 20-30 minutes and my legs, my upper legs especially, shake a decent bit. Sore for a few days after lessons, too.

It's a good soreness, don't get me wrong! It's the perfect "I had a good workout" burn but not a full of "I can't do anything with my legs" feeling.

I've seen jump rope suggested, so I bought one but I'm really bad at it. Need to practice more. Other than that and simply practicing the movements, planks, and wall squats what else can I do at home? </TEXT>

I think I'm just going to grab a GTX 970, but with Cyber Monday a little over a month away, I'm wondering if I should wait. I haven't been in the market for new hardware in a long time though, are there ever any actually good deals on good hardware for Black Friday / Cyber Monday? I feel like it's always just cheap junk marked down slightly cheaper.

The big thing is I'm just an impatient nerd and don't want to wait until *after* my Thanksgiving break from work to get a GPU that can really handle FO4. But if there's a chance of saving more than $50, I might suck it up and wait.

What do you guys think?

They start, the camera pans to teammates faces and misses a second or two of action. Am I just a newcomer way over-analyzing every little bit? Or is this actually as big of a deal as I think it is. Because that's plenty of time to decide a match really- or so I think?

I'm just trying to focus on watching their feet / legs at the moment; we didn't learn anything about the right of way tonight so I don't really follow the fights very well. Any other suggestions on what to watch for? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've only been in one relationship my entire life (25), it was long distance ended over four years so.

I miss sex, I miss having someone who was curious how my day was, someone to hold and talk to... But I don't know. I don't meet women, I don't "get" people in general. I've tried dating sites to no success.

I'm kind of at a point where I simply don't care, I guess. Being single can get lonely sometimes, but I dunno. Feel like it's just not worth the effort. I don't know if that's just me "throwing in the towel" or if I seriously have no genuine desire for a relationship.

Anyone else feel indifferent towards being in a relationship? If a girl asked me out, I wouldn't say no. But on my own I just no desire to take steps to change it.

One of my roommates spends so much time at his girlfriend's, and when my other roommates goes on dates I'll get "jealous" and tend to poke around on Tinder / OKC more, but I think it's more so I just want people to be with, rather than the goal to be in a relationship. </TEXT>

I've diagrammed the classes, but there's a lot of C++ stuff I don't really know much about or how to carry over their behavior to .NET.

From what little I understand of it's business functionality, it's mostly just textfile processing / CRUD functions. Nothing too complicated and I don't believe I'm required to modify the database.

Just wondering if anyone has any tips, tricks, wisdom or other words of advice before really sinking my teeth into this? Not really sure how I should model my application, either. Unfortunately my education in college didn't focus heavily on layering the application / how to handle database-related code beyond "Make sure you sanitize / parameterize your queries". In my professional experience anything DB related has already been written and developed and largely out of my control too. Any suggestions for reading materials here? I'd like to try and do this right, and learn while doing it but I don't really know where to begin.

Our main application / product isn't exactly well engineered, so I'm not necessarily under the gun here but again I'd like to do a good job. Something I can be proud of. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Why are some paint jobs insanely expensive? For example, since most of us here have probably fiddled with the Focus RS builder on Ford's site, why is Nitrous Blue $600 more?

In another thread, someone had commented Ford would almost never offer their promotional paint job Liquid Blue as an option "because it'd be like a $3K paint job", or something to that effect.

What the hell makes one paint so much more expensive than another? I get there's varying *qualities* to a paint job; you could use shitty quality paints and get two blacks that look very similar but one won't hold up as well, chips more easily etc.

But why does the color effect the price? Also, in the case of a promotional color where you don't have an exact color code, could you get a vinyl wrap in an extremely similar color? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gonna try to swing by a Ford dealership after work today to scope out either a Focus ST or Fiesta ST as part of their Labor Day 0% APR deal.

Currently drive a 2003 350Z, which isn't very practical in Buffalo NY. I like the power and full size of the Focus, but living downtown maybe I want the Fiesta. I don't know.

Just wanted to see what /r/Ford 's opinion is on the two.

Edit: Test drove both yesterday, or rather I should say I test drove a Focus and a Fiesta. They didn't have an ST of either on the lot. The Focus SE I actually liked a lot in terms of power, but I couldn't believe how smooth and disconnected it felt. Anyone able to weigh in on just how much more stiff the ST is?

Didn't care for the Fiesta. Not sure what trim it was, and unfortunately it was an automatic where as the Focus was a manual. But just how narrow it is, turning felt... Bleh. And the exterior didn't seem much smaller, while the interior definitely felt more crowded.

Left "empty handed", as I didn't realize I couldn't option a new ST but rather I had to pick from what they have. Makes sense, but shit, if I'm paying for a new car I'm going to get what I want. </TEXT>

That was the first time I genuinely did not feel in control at all, long story short I stood up, took my glasses off and kind of ran / shambled into the kitchen and just fell face first onto the ground. Pretty hard. Then laid there and felt like Frodo in the Wraith world or whatever when he puts on The Ring.

Doctor has me on some new meds, so I don't know if it was a bad mix between the two, or just a bad high but holy shit. I honestly don't even want to smoke after last night, which is a shame because I really really like weed.

What was /r/trees worst experience with smoking? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> At first, I loved Archer. I haven't caught the last season or two, but after a few seasons I got sick and tired of every episode being the same damn joke over and over. Then when "Phrasing!" got tired they switched to "Are we still doing 'Phrasing'?"

Or How I Met Your Mother with Barney starting out as a pretty entertaining character before quick devolving into the same expected punch line every episode and so many running gags. Or however many lines from Arrested Development get quoted all the time.

I just started watching Rick and Morty, and while I absolutely love it I can foresee myself getting "burnt out" on it if Rick has to keep shouting wubba lubba dub dub every other episode, or whatever other random nonsense. We'll see how the rest of this season goes / next season, but with the DOTA 2 announcer pack I'm already tired of seeing people shout it every game.

I just feel like so many shows are trying to practically just be a meme, so to speak, and it just feels lazy. No one is an actual character anymore, but rather just an attitude and a catch phrase they can cram into whatever situation to make it funny rather than just actually being funny.

Admittedly, I don't watch a ton of TV shows, and the ones I do are usually fairly popular on the internet so maybe it's just an unfortunate blend of overexposure to the community but I just can't stand it anymore.

Really hope R M continues to be fresh and entertaining :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently moved downtown. Street lights attract bugs. Bugs attract spiders.

Every single day I have to wipe cobwebs off my car, they set up shop in the mirror housings and weave webs spanning from the side mirrors to the door handles. I wipe 'em away and once or twice I'm lucky enough to catch the bastard in the act I'll get rid of him too, but the next day a new one moves in.

Anyone here dealt with this? It's really frustrating. Not sure what I can do to get a more permanent solution? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have never had a great relationship with my family. I mean, I love them and get along, but hardly ever talk to any of them on a real, meaningful level. I'm not sure if I've talked to my dad since his birthday a month ago, and only talked to my mom just the other day after not talking in probably about a month as well. I've certainly never talked to them about women, confidence problems, only basic stuff about my professional life (they don't fundamentally "get" what I do as a software developer at all)

It's not that I don't like them or whatever, it's just that my life is boring and have nothing to talk about.

I have two best friends, one I live with and one I used to live with 400 miles away. I can talk to either of these guys about almost anything except for the deepest personal problems.

I saw a therapist for the first time yesterday and while I think I always new I don't have great relationships, I think I never realized just how unhealthy it is either.

I was just curious, how about the men (and women) of /r/AskMen. How many people would you say you actually can comfortably have a meaningful conversation with? What's it like to have a closer relationship with your parents beyond being grateful for them raising you and providing? I want to try and fix it but I have no fucking clue how. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've had depression for a very long time and I've always just kind of dealt with it. I got by going to school and going to work, but beyond that I struggle to do anything I don't "have" to do.

I brought it up with my PCP in the last abd after asking 10 questions he gave a prescription, but I stopped taking it after a month.

Early this year I finally got diagnosed with ADD by a specialist and she picked up on the depression too, but I didn't really pursue trying to correct it. Anyways, finally going tomorrow go see her again but I have absolutely no idea what to expect from the visit, I suspect it'll be a little more thorough than my Primary Care Physician.

For those of you that see a therapist / have been diagnosed, what's it like? I feel like I should be preparing my thoughts about how I feel but I have no idea. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I grew up in a house where my parents worked opposite shifts. My did worked 6AM - 2 PM [the latest], I'd get home from school around 3ish, and my mom would work 4:30 PM - 11:30 PM or so.

At any given time, the dog was never left home alone. Usually walked anywhere from 3-5 miles per day. Extremely healthy and happy.

I'd consider my parents excellent animal owners, and I'd like to be too. I work full time, as do both my roommates. I'd feel bad about leaving a dog unattended 5 days a week from 7 AM when I leave until 5 PM when I get home.

What's /r/dogs opinion? Am I sort of "over-reacting" to how dogs handle solitude? I know every one is different, but I just feel bad about it. I want a dog so bad though, grew up with them all my childhood until moving out 6 years ago and haven't had one since. But I finally live in apartment that could allow a small / medium sized one.

At my last job I could work from home and then it wouldn't have been a problem, but then I got laid off and the new job isn't so generous in that regard =[ </TEXT>

<TEXT> In about a year and a half I've [lost 50 pounds](http://imgur.com/a/Jbxyn) - photos taken exactly 1y3m apart - and am pretty damn close to where I want to be. I'm really not sure how much more I need to go, actually. But not much. Five or ten pounds maybe? I'm 5'8 and weigh 170 lbs. I saw my family for the first time in a while this weekend and they were all so shocked at how much weight I've lost.

I've always struggled with my own image, even when I was in *good* shape. But for the first time in my life, I'm starting to feel decent about myself. A little bit more to go, but I'm almost there. As I said in my title, it took me longer than some, and I haven't lost half as much as some here either, but your progress did help motivate me to change something I thought I wasn't capable of and has lead to a lot of mental changes, for the better, as well.

Also, I have a weird question. I think I have a habit of sucking my gut in a tad, developed in an attempt to not appear so overweight from years of being uncomfortable about my weight. In the second picture I'm trying not to do that at all and I feel like I still have maybe 10 pounds of fat to drop. But again I really don't know how much I need to and I think I don't really even have an idea as to what a healthy subject721 looks like. Anyone know how I can find this sort of thing out? I know BMI is really such an inaccurate measurement. Of course I'll just keep working at it, but... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sadly, I think the time has come for me to part ways with my Z.

Currently, it's registered in Massachusetts and I live in NY. I still have my MA plates and drivers license, and owe about $2K on the 9.99% interest loan.

Loan company won't let me register it in NY while I'm still paying it off, so I don't know if I can just go to a dealership and sell it to them and get something in my new state and switch over all plates / license to NY?

I'd rather try and sell it privately to get the most for my money, but it's difficult to coordinate getting the money, paying off the loan, get the title in the mail, hand it over etc.

I think I might just try and finish paying it off ASAP (I probably could within 2 months) and then go from there but I'm just trying to figure everything out now.

Any of you guys able to shed some light on the best way to approach this, or any input? I don't know what the best order to do things is. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm looking for a car more fuel efficient, more practical, and *a little better* for these North-East US winters than my 350Z while still being a little fun. I love the styling of the Veloster, and I *want* a turbo but we'll have to see what the budget can afford and the market has used. Looking around the 15K side of things, which usually means an old NA one with 20-50K miles.

I know everyone says the NA version is completely lifeless and you have to go turbo'd, but before my Z I drove a Corolla. *That* is lifeless. So if I have to drive a boring car, well, I can deal with that.

I'm more concerned about how the car itself has aged. Does it still get good MPG after a few years? How's the interior hold up? Plastic rattle at all? I know the rear visibility can't be great, but coming from my car it can't possibly be worse. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I currently drive an '03 350Z in Buffalo NY. I love it, but it sucks on gas, isn't practical, and frankly I simply can't afford to mod it as I'd like.

Think it's best to just outright get rid of it and get something more practical, but still a little fun.

It only has 69k miles on it, so I could probably get 7.5-10K depending on private sale or dealership. I still owe $2K on it, but I intend to pay it off soon.

Combined with that, I could put in about 2K of my own money on top of that and then finance whatever might be remaining. Looking to spend 15-20k tops.

So I'm looking for a 3 or 5 door, preferably Manual transmission. I really like the Focus ST, Veloster, Mazda 3, Imprezza Wagon. I don't like VW's at all, so I'm really not interested in Golfs and GTI's but I could be persuaded. ST looks like it's probably a tad out of my reach :(

Just wondering if you guys had any opinions in the ones I mentioned, or other suggestions? Just glancing at cars.com and autotrader to try and get an idea but it's tough as I'm on mobile right now.

Another thing I was considering was just getting a super cheap shitbox I don't care about at all and enjoy not having a car payment and saving up for something I REALLY want in the future. I'm 24M with almost 70K in student loans and make 62 a year. So it'd be nice to not have a car payment but I don't know... </TEXT>

<TEXT> A group of friends of mine that run the D D adventure leagues at various stores in the greater Buffalo area host a convention every year, and while I wasn't able to attend last year's, I hear it's a pretty good time although a relatively smaller convention in the scheme of things.

Anyways, they're doing a kickstarter and are only a few hundred bucks shy of their target with about a week to go. Just wanted to post the word about it in case anyone in reddit hadn't heard of it and might be interested

<TEXT> I just built it for the first time [this game](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1449368133) as CM, and it seemed pretty damn powerful to use on my Allies after they've been Doomed, or Boats or any of the other array of spells the other team had.

The only thing I don't like about it is that Attack Speed doesn't do much for my favorite frosty bitch, but otherwise it's solid. 1400 isn't prohibitively expensive for one component as a support, 550 is peanuts for the other.

This wasn't necessarily the best testing-ground though, aside from Medusa feeding a few kills early it was pretty one-sided. Shadow Fiend crushed mid, Axe + Brood absolutely dominated their lane. Pretty lucky Techies is, largely (in solo queue anyways) a pretty low-impact hero because he was getting a ton of kills but just did nothing with his advantages.

I don't think I've seen it too much in competitive games, but I'm not watching extremely closely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I moved here from another state almost 2 years ago for work and am now being laid off. As a contractor with ~1.5 years experience I was making 71.5k. Just shy of 3 years experience, now.

While looking for new work, primarily with staffing agencies, the topic of salary naturally comes up. I hate saying, "I don't really know what's average for the area, as I moved here for this job" and I've just started saying 60-65, but I really don't know if that's reasonable for my skillet / experience / the region. Amongst other factors, this has been causing a bit of stress for me, wondering if I'm asking too much and companies are going with someone else because of that. Would the staffing agency tell me that?

I've looked around in GlassDoor but I have no idea how reliable that info is. </TEXT>

I know it's not a particularly big issue, but I just thought I'd point it out. Love that you don't have to play every day, by the way. Even if I *do* play every day =X


* What determines an artifacts base stats? Do they scale with my Character level?
* What happens when you buy new Robes with Exalted Emblems and change your class when you have Royalty Points spent on class-specific Perks? For example, I have 6 points into Guardian Angel. Do they get refunded if I change to a Death Mage?
* Is there any way to get a particular Scroll? It'd be *really* nice to always have some Dispel scrolls with me or something, certain debuffs are just so powerful :( Very unfortunate when my best attacker gets 1-shotted due to Haunt or something.
* Do all Nether creatures take **way** more exp? I recently got my first one and he's leveling extremely slow. I wasn't sure if it was something to do with the enchantments or egg color. I suppose that's there to help balance them out, and to put more emphasis on the +EXP enchantments (admittedly, my first thought when I saw that was an option was "No thanks!") </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been working for my current company for a year and a half as a contract employee. I was supposed to be laid off months ago due to budget cuts, but a manager I indirectly reported to fought upper management and had me moved to a different position instead. Unfortunately new team was also not immune to aforementioned budget cuts and now I'm being let go for real.

Said manager got me an interview for 2 other positions in the company but they didn't work out, then he's been keeping his ears open for external opportunities for me as well.

He's much older, I'd say late 50's. I'm in my mid 20's. We work in IT and he's got his degree in engineering, pilots license and has a few sketches of planes and such around his cubicle, but otherwise I don't know him exceptionally well because he's not my *actual* boss, but rather just kind of keeps tabs on all the teams in the office.

I wanted to get him a little something, trying to keep it under $50 just because I don't know what my finance situation looks like (waiting on a job offer) but I've always been terrible at this sort of thing. I was thinking like maybe a model of a plane or av engine he could assemble, or just a gift certificate to a nice restaurant in the city- but he actually commutes from a different state so I don't think that'd be a "convenient" gift... </TEXT>

Often times you'll have an actual face-to-face with someone, discuss the usual things; education, work existence in detail, what I like to do with software development / want to do etc.

It's very heavily geared towards what you actually know, and you're expected to be able to prove it.

<DATE> 2015-04-19 19:07:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I smoke pot a little bit primarily just on the weekends. I've been steadily employed all my life and have largely stayed out of trouble. I've got a pretty good resume for my age, and was recently informed my contract at work is going to be cut short due to budget cuts.

I haven't smoked since I got the news (2 weeks ago) and just failed a home drug test. This company I've been interviewing with basically made an offer Friday, pending drug + background check.

After an interview with them they called not even 20 minutes later asking when I could come in for a follow-up interview. While I was doing a written code challenge for the position at the next interview, both the HR Director and IT Director popped their heads in separately and both said they really want me, and that while I should continue interviewing with other companies they both said "Call and talk to us before you accept any offer".


So I don't really know what to do. I need to get the test done by tomorrow the latest, and there's no way my system will be clear. I was considering just writing them an email and being  completely upfront and telling them I periodically smoke, that it has never impacted my performance and it never will and provide a list of references if they wish to speak with them.

I'm hoping they want me badly enough to be able to overlook this or come to some sort of agreement. I don't know. I'm also afraid that the staffing agency that got me the interview will be told why I wasn't hired and who knows if they'll want to continue to work with me or what.


Any ideas, guys? :( </TEXT>

I'm 99% confident this guy was buzzed or drunk, he just had that slow response confused stupor drunk people get in.

I got home and called my insurance and filed a claim, then tried to call the police but they said it's too late for them to do anything. This morning I looked my car over and there is, somehow, no body damage it looks like-- I think he just hit my tire / wheel.

I got a call from his insurance company this morning at work, but I didn't answer since I didn't recognize the number... About to call them back.

Should I schedule an appointment with a mechanic? Have them look over the wheel and see if anything's wrong? What then? I've never been in an accident before, don't really know what the hell to do... </TEXT>

Ideally, my set of criteria would look like this:

* At least 4 inches tall (6-8 is ideal)
* Plastic
* Less assembly required the better (I don't think I'm gonna get this though)
* Fantasy (huge bonus for treant or 'nature' things like that)

I've got my eye on the [Treeman](http://www.games-workshop.com/en-US/Treeman) and [Treeman Ancient](http://www.games-workshop.com/en-US/Treeman-Ancient) from GW but the art style isn't 100% what I want.


I found this one on Google but I can't find it on GW's page, wonder if it's just an older model or something.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a degree in software development and have been working in the industry for about 2.5 years now, just making Windows forms applications, and coding professionally has sapped any will to program "recreationally" when I'm off the clock, so I haven't really given it the full attention it deserves since finishing school.

That said, I've recently somewhat rekindled my interest in coding and want to just make a small, light weight application on 2 computers that would share and display information the other client enters in real time. *Ideally*, I'd like to do this without a database but I don't know if that'd be possible. Could I just write to a local XML file and then push that info to the other client each time the user makes a change to it? I really have no idea how to go about designing this tool and am just looking for input.

It's actually for a small business (non business critical application) which is why I'd rather not get a DB involved just because I think that'd add a whole extra layer of complexity and overhead.

But yea I have absolutely no idea how to handle cross-client communication like that or anything... Would you guys be able to at least point me in the direction of what technologies I should look up? </TEXT>

*  MSI P67A-G45 mobo (LGA 1155)
* 128 GB SSD + 1TB HDD

I don't remember what size PSU is here, I want to say 850? I bought a 650W off NewEgg and often times my computer just wouldn't boot up at all so I did the impatient thing and bought some expensive Corsair PSU from Best Buy since I didn't want to wait for my RMA to process and buy a new one.

So I'd say a new GPU would *probably* be the wise choice, but with all the drama surrounding the 970 I don't want to get one. Unfortunately I'm irrationally loyal to Intel / Nvidia- have had multiple bad experiences with AMD and nothing will change my mind.

But I'm curious how much of a bottleneck would my CPU actually be if I buy a new GPU?

I *could* afford a 980 no problem if I wanted to, but I mostly just play Dota 90% of the time. I'm about to buy Far Cry 4 since it's on sale this weekend, and my PC was pretty sluggish with Dragon Age Inquisition so I dunno. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I could use some advice on how to handle this situation with a dealer. (Kinda long) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-07 16:31:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So maybe a month ago, a redditor on /r/trees gave me a connect (I recently moved to an unfamiliar area and am a new smoker). I bought a quarter of Girl Scout Cookies from him and they were pretty fuckin' good, hadn't talked to him since.

My roommate asked me for the dude's number, dealer said he had some Jack the Ripper and to swing by his house so we bought a quarter. He hands it to us and my buddy's immediate thought was "Well. That looks really small, but maybe it's just dense as fuck." My roommate hands him $90 and says "We agreed on $85 but all I have is $90, so could you either give me change or give me the next quarter for $80?" and he gave us the $5 back.

We get home and weigh it... It's 3 fucking grams. Text him a picture of the scale... no response. Call him back and ask what the fuck. He said to come back over and he gives us $45 back (just over half the price, since we have just under half the amount we ordered). Then he has some elaborate story about how he had 2 bags; a quarter and an eighth then he noticed the screen to his window was open, implying someone snuck in and took *one bag of weed*-- as if someone is just gunna leave another bag behind.

Then after the dealer said he never even received my roommate's picture-- so he just took our word for it that he shorted us 4 grams!?

Clearly this kid is full of shit and just tried to rip us off, got caught and knows he fucked up.

So I don't know what to do, this is the best weed I've ever fucking smoked, not that I've tried *a lot* of stuff but I've had a few **really** experienced smokers agree. My roommate already severed his relationship with this dealer but I haven't yet. I don't know if I want to set a precedent where I need to bring a scale with me every time I buy weed, or if I should just fuck off and find someone else? It's been so difficult trying to find someone who treats it like what it is: a business. Someone who is on time, has good stuff, the right fucking amount...

Oh well, if nothing else at least this $5 scale saved my buddy and I $40.

I just don't get why he'd invite us to his house, give us the change, *take our word for it being 3.0 grams*, his story of what happened being shit and STILL try to rip us off. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Cost cutting measures at the company, I might be losing the job that brought me here from 400 miles away. Made 65K last year with only about 2.5 years of experience under my belt as of today.

I know the finance industry tends to pay a bit more than others, but can anyone shed some light on what a competitive salary in Buffalo would be for someone with similar experience levels? Most of my dev experience has been with C# / .NET if that makes a difference (I *assume* Java developers are less valued because of how many UB can churn out?). I also know Buffalo is pretty cheap compared to most cities so, again, I don't really know what's average.

I've poked around on Indeed and Monster and such, but so many postings don't list a salary.

I recall a post on this sub a few months ago about a "lack of qualified developers" in Buffalo and the dude got laughed out of here because their "competitive salary" was like 35K or something abysmal like that...

**TL;DR** Is 55-80K unreasonable for a developer with 2.5 years of experience and a strong desire to learn in Buffalo? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I know the best thing is to just cut out pretty much everything but water and actually good beverages, but I just cannot beat my sweet tooth. I need *something* and I'm trying to perform a little damage control.

I don't really know much about the actual nutrition side of weight loss, other than trying to stick to my calorie goal and up whatever nutrients are low but how much damage to my weight loss progress am I actually doing if I have a zero calorie zero sugar energy drink anywhere from 4-7 times per week (usually on the lower end of that spectrum)?


I understand I'll probably be riddled with cancer of every organ in like 2 years time, but as far as weight loss goes how detrimental are they? </TEXT>

<TITLE> I saw a dentist about a bridge today, is this a legitimate concern or is the dentist just trying to make a bit of money? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-23 15:01:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When I was about 11 or so, I knocked out my front tooth, my front right one. I had a root canal, it was reinserted, I got braces, braces came off, tooth came with it.

Since then, I've been wearing a retainer with a fake tooth molded to it (I'm 24 now). I'm looking into getting a more permanent solution and my dentist proposed these 2 solutions:

* Bone graph + implant, *probably* in the neighborhood of $6K total.

* A bridge, but I was told they would want to do the front teeth, the two next to those, and the canines. I was told that in order to "match the teeth and make them look as good as possible" the bridge would have to span all 6 teeth, instead of just the 2 adjacent ones. Was lead to believe this would lead to be similar in price as the implant.

Now I obviously don't know anything about this sort of thing and I can't tell if I legitimately *should* consider a piece that affects all 6 teeth or if I'd be totally fine with just the simpler bridge that only affects the adjacent ones.

Thoughts? </TEXT>

<TITLE> What's the best course of action for my new (first) bong? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-20 18:38:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My roommate has a cheaper bong that has a rubber stopper for the stem but the actual bowl unscrews. On the other side, it has an actual carb on it. It does the job but we don't love it, so I decided to pony up for something that [I thought / hope ] is better.

http://i.imgur.com/dCJmspE.jpg

Ended up picking up this giant thing. I didn't realize it doesn't have a dedicated carb like my roommate's piece. It has a rubber stopper around the glass stem, and it's **really difficult** to pull it out, so when I'm smoking it's a pain in the ass to spark it up, take a hit, pull the tube out to get air in, and really inhale.

I was considering buying a secondary piece, I think they're called a slider? I'm not fully sure what size I should buy or anything.

Alternatively, if I just pull the stem in and out a few times, will it move more easily? Or could I just remove the rubber stopper? I assume that'd break the air-tight seal and ruin it ultimately. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys, I just bought my first bong! I've used my roommates, which is just a small $15 acrylic pipe. For a while, my roommate has been unhappy with it so I took it upon myself to buy a nice glass piece for us.

Picture: http://i.imgur.com/PfLBjMM.jpg

I wasn't sure how much water should you actually put in it? Do I just need enough to cover the stem in the bottom "bulb" of the pipe? I've barely used my roommates, and whenever I do he loads it up and I don't really notice I guess. Any general bong care I should be aware of?

Edit: This might be a stupid question, but the moment I "suck" on the pipe to bring the flame in, it immediately goes out and I get nothing. What am I doing wrong? :( </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey dudes, so I started playing very recently (on and off since beta, but never got past level 50 until this character at 73).

I'm playing [Mathil's Elemental Buzzsaw build](http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/690708) and this is my gear:

http://i.imgur.com/y9UIVZW.jpg

Obviously Alpha's Howl is BIS but everything else is just OK. Then this morning I found those Maligro's Virtuosity. Below them I included the gloves I *was* wearing, because I don't know if I should sell Maligro's or not. They look pretty valuable on poe.trade ranging from 30C to 1 or 2 Ex?


Maligro's was about a 200 DPS increase, almost 10% gains on my main Spectral Throw, but I lost a bit of Cold resistances and I can no longer use the Item Rarity on my "secondary" Spec Throw. My gems match up to the ones in the build linked above for his Scion. I only have like 3 or 4 Fusing's so it's unlikely I'd be able to 4L it. I have plenty of Chromatics to try and get GGRB though.

Despite the Alpha's Howl I'm actually pretty broke; 6  Chaos orbs and handfuls of other random orbs. I can't imagine I have more than 20C (at most) if I liquidated all my orbs.

What do you guys think I should do? Try and sell the Maligro's to get a 6L chest so I can add Faster Attacks support, try to upgrade my jewelry, keep the Maligro's? </TEXT>

<TITLE> What are some Newbie tips to gaining currency early on / A few easy questions about the economy </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just started playing about 8 or 9 days ago and I'm level 68 and running low level maps pretty comfortably. After buying some stuff I have 1 Chaos Orb, and a few other orbs of similar value (a few Vaals, Regals etc) but not many.

* Are any certain types of semi-common items that are almost always worth picking up and trying to sell?

* Obviously 5L or 6L chests / weapons are good, but what about 4L gloves/helm/boots?

* I have a 6S chest but it's not fully linked, is that total garbage? Do people roll through tons of fusings and chromatics trying to make it perfect, or is that only done on otherwise already perfect gear. This is just a white lvl 58 Loricated Ringmail with Armor and Energy Shield

* What are "good" stats on non-weapons? Resistances, max life, damage?

I'm aware of the Chaos Orb(s) vendor recipe, but I never seem to find rare jewelry. Same with the Fusing recipe for 6S stuff, and Chromatics from 'rainbow' linked items. Other than that... I have no idea what I can do to start gaining currency early on. </TEXT>

<TITLE> At what point do you think smoking too much is a problem, if it is at all? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-18 22:45:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm a pretty new ent, I'd say I only REALLY started smoking in late October / early November, though technically I started in early September.

For the first two weeks of December, I was out of work (company temporarily told all the contract workers to get bent) for 2 weeks and smoked probably 10 of those 14 days. Since being back to work this week, I've still smoked each day this week if you count the small hit I took last night to help me sleep.

I work from home full time and I have almost no work to do, as the company is "layering" the temporary unemployments so most of my team is either on vacation or out of work. So this leaves me bored **as fuck**.

Between the boredom, smoking being a new thing, minor bouts of depression, and just genuinely enjoying smoking... It's like the only thing I want to do lately.

I don't know, I wish I could I could motivate myself to do something productive with all this spare time while having no real work to do. I haven't smoked on the clock yet but damn the temptation is real, man. I guess between me just generally not being a motivated person I'm sort of afraid of getting 'mentally addicted' and just fully embrace being lazy as fuck.

I generally agree with the sentiment that "pot doesn't make you lazy; you're lazy and also you smoke"

Soo... I dunno... just curious what you all think of smoking very frequently when you have nothing you need to do? There are a handful of other hobbies I'm interested in or want to pick up that I could do during this downtime, but anytime I start I just get distracted and quit quickly. </TEXT>

Let's face it, we all love Blizzard because they tend to put a ton of effort into releasing a truly AAA product with immense polish.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 5,000 miles ago I had a Nissan dealership replace my serpentine belt. The other day I went on a road trip to a different state, went throw a toll booth and slowed down. Sped up after passing through it, when suddenly my battery and brake lights came on and my power steering went. 10 PM and single digit temperatures, I toughed it out and drove the 10 miles to my buddy's house. Next morning I drove it to a nearby garage per my friend's recommendation. Mechanic lifts up my car in front of me and we both saw a bunch of bolts were missing, or not put on tight and then obviously the belt was half off.

He only billed me $30 for half an hour labor, and all my friends are saying I should "go after" the dealership for doing a half-ass job. But I have no way to prove any of this, the repairs happened in a different state and the invoice just has the labor on it. No details of what was actually done or anything. Would I be wasting my time, or could I get some money back from the dealership do you think? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I went to college for software engineering and graduated a few years ago. A friend of mine I met in school graduated a year ahead of me. Fast forward to now, I have a pretty decent job that pays very well and it's cushy as fuck. Work remotely any time I want and have very little work to do which leaves me with a lot of free time on the clock.

He on the other hand is still working a minimum wage job in an office with his mom. He has two siblings, his mother, and his father passed away some time before I met him (so at this point it's been more than 6 years) and lives at home with them all.

The thing is though, he's done nothing with his degree. I don't think he's ever interviewed for a position in his field and I've never heard him talk about finding a different job or anything. I've tried to help him out, when I left my last job (in-field) I asked if he wanted me to give his resume to my boss and he said yes.

Anyways, lately anytime something work related comes up he always seems to have a comment about how I never work / get to play video games all the time. For example, this Friday I worked 2PM - 2 AM but a lot of it was "wait for the other team to finish an update before I can test my changes" so it was more like just be indefinitely tethered to my computer until they say I can go and at like 1:45 me and a few friends are on voice chat and he said something about how I 'never actually work'. But it just has this snarky tone and lately it's really starting to piss me off and I just generally avoid talking to him lately. It's not just general men ball-busting each other, it has just that little bit of jealous sound to it.

I mentioned this to a mutual friend of ours, who is kind of the "glue" in this particular circle of friends. He felt that I should confront the other guy and just tell him to knock it off, but the thing is I don't really *care*. I'm fine avoiding him and only having minimal interaction, but my other friend is making it out like I have some moral obligation to try and help him or something. We've never been particularly close, it's what I'd call a "superficial" friendship where 99% of the conversation is mutual hobbies. Never anything "deep" or personal.

Not really sure what I should do... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I found this Craigslist post:

http://i.imgur.com/KPjLubH.png

My 2 roommates and I currently live in a 2 BR with one of us living in the living room. Obviously not an ideal situation. Just poking around on CL and came across this. I called the number and was told the house is in foreclosure and we'd have the option of signing over the loan to one of our names, or simply pay monthly and rent it. He told me to go online to some website and sign up to fill out an application, to which I said I'm at work and would call back later. Feel like if it were a legit thing they'd just put the website in the post?

The apartment is down near Niagara and Virginia street. I don't know the area well at all, I moved to Amherst a year ago and have been into the actual city all of maybe 2 or 3 times?

One roommate said "I don't believe a house like that exists in that area". Looks too good to be true, so it probably is. The piss poor grammar in the post further leads me to believe it's a scam. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been depressed for years and largely kept it to myself. I finally broke down and told a friend a lot about how I've been feeling and he sort of 'forced' me to get some help.

Anyways, so I have my first appointment today in a few hours and I'm really scared and I don't want to go. I feel like I should be excited or perhaps eager, shouldn't I? Instead I feel like someone who was involved in a serious accident and needs extensive physical therapy and would just rather give up and not even try and just deal with my situation. I don't know, it's stupid...

For those of you who have gotten help, how did you feel ahead of time? How do you feel now and how long has it been? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm currently a contractor for a huge, global corporation and it pays very well as a contractor. I used to work for a tiny company that made little and paid less.

I was told that if and when the company converts you to a permanent employee, they ask what you used to make and they offer you an amount based on that. At my old job though, I was laughably underpaid. 36K with a bachelors writing software.

I was wondering if I "have" to answer should they ask me, and can my former employer disclose that information should my current place ask? </TEXT>

By 5th level, you have 6 spells known. 4x lvl 1, 3x lvl 2, 2x lvl 3. Which is a total of 7 spells

Can someone explain what I'm missing? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been depressed for a long time but only now trying to get help. A year ago I moved far from home for work and since moving here I've made 0 friends. I knew my roommate before moving here and he's my best and oldest friend, then I have another roommate who I like but we're not super close. The latter is barely around and is always at his girlfriend's place. The former recently has been seeing a girl a lot lately which leaves me by myself.

Like I think many others here, it's these "idle times" that are the worst where all the toxic thoughts and self loathing pour into my head and lately it's getting the best of me. I just don't know what to do... Once per week I go out and play D D with a group I found online but I don't feel like I fit in, as I never have anywhere in life. That is the full extent of my social life. Don't fit in at work, don't really have any hobbies and my depression hinders any attempt I make at new things.

What do you guys do when you have nothing to do, Reddit is slow, etc.? I'm going out of my mind tonight and can't sleep :(  I've been having days like this more and more recently </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've had my '03 Z for 1 year and 7 months as of today, and I absolutely love it to death. It only has about 64K miles on it, and is in pretty solid shape.

The reason I'm considering selling it though is because *ideally* I want to get a replacement DD and turn my Z into a track project... But with massive student loans and my living situation (apartment complex; might be moving to a city w/o off-street parking) it's really not feasible to own two cars.

I don't know, I could pay it off by January probably and then that'd be $400/mo more in my pocket (I'm paying roughly double my min payment) to do whatever I wanted, financially. But it just seems so impractical unless I had like a house and my own garage and whatnot for 2 cars. Also I sort of feel like the wiser thing would be to put the money I'd be saving by *not* having a car payment towards my student loans, get out of debt faster and then have some serious cash to play around with...

Sorry, that was a little bit longer than I wanted it to be I'm just really frustrated and unhappy lately =[ Looking to get some other peoples' opinions </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm a bit of a noob when it comes to D D despite playing a fair amount of 3.5, 4, and now 5. I just never really got into more "advanced" mechanics. I was thinking of making a Human Monk and foregoing the +1 to every Ability Score in exchange for +1 to two of them, and starting with the Grappler feat at level 1.

Grappling reduces the victims speed to 0, and they cannot benefit from speed increasing effects. I can move at half my speed and drag them along with me. Then with the feat, I'd gain Advantage against my target so I could use my bonus action for another unarmed attack, and you can pin them as well. Additionally, enemies that are one size larger don't automatically escape the grapple.

Am I missing something? It seems a little... Underwhelming? A few friends say it's a really powerful mechanic but can't really elaborate as to why. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys, so my PC is a about 3-3.5 years old but I feel like it's starting to show its age and with the higher requirements on Shadows of Mordor I think I'm going to be pretty let down with this old girl on Tuesday.

* MSI P67A-G45 mobo
* i7 2600k (3.4 Ghz, Sandy Bridge), not overclocking it
* 8 GB of RAM
* GTX 580
* 128 GB SSD boot drive + 1 TB HDD

I'm not really sure where my biggest bottle neck is- I feel like all of it's kind of low at this point.
Part of me wants to just be really irresponsible and build a whole new rig but I know I shouldn't. So I was hoping I could get away with a GTX 980 and a new CPU or something but I don't know what's the latest architecture to see if it's compatible with my socket (1155 LGA).
Any suggestions? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My serpentine belt has been squealing like a bitch, but it was replaced about 10K miles ago. A mechanic told me the actually pulley needs to replaced, which should be expensive because they need to pull the radiator to get at it- or so they told me. Quoted me around ~700 parts   labor.

Other than that, my brake pads have been also squealing a bit but the same mechanic said they should be "good for at least 5K more miles". I suspect the dealership I bought my Z from probably just used the cheapest of the cheap pads when I bought the car-- they sure did with the MSRP $70 all seasons that were on it.

What else might I expect? When I bought the car last February I did pick up an extended warranty just because it's an '03 so I'm really hoping the first issue is covered (need to read through the paperwork) but I suspect any non-critical replacements won't be covered. </TEXT>

I've decided to get back into D D and picked up the 5E PHB at my local shop last night to quickly join in on an encounters campaign and quickly rolled a Dwarf Fighter. I want to join a different campaign in addition, though, but I want to play something different for once. I haven't decided whether I'll be a Sorcerer, Wizard, or Warlock but I know it'll be one of those three. I've read over their classes, I've read over the spell chapter but I still don't really "get" it.

What's the difference between Cantrips versus what's in my Spellbook, or example? Just hoping someone could simply give a run-down of how being a caster actually works in D D, please :( </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I've never really been a healthy person when it comes to my diet, but when I was young I was pretty physically active so it didn't matter. Fast forward 6 years and I weigh 215 pounds at my worst. Many on-and-off session at the gym and I'm down to about 200 now. Took another break this summer, but I'm back at it again. I downloaded MyFitnessPal and I've been tracking everything I eat for the past 2 weeks or so.

Lately, the past week, I've been very prone to that sort of dizzy feeling you get when you get up from laying down too quickly. The past two days this feeling has lingered from when I get out of bed for *at least* an hour.

According to MyFitnessPal, my sugar intake has been about half of what it says I'm allowed. Last week I consumed about 254 out of 497 grams of sugar. I used drink lots of soda and junk food, so I'm hoping my body is just still adapting to my new diet where I'm trying to be healthier. In the past 2 weeks I've only had a small soda twice, though I haven't been able to cut my addiction to energy drinks (usually get the zero calorie ones).

Just wondering if anyone can weigh in as to whether or not this is normal / related? I have an unrelated doctor's appointment next Friday, so I'll bring it up if it's still going on...

<TITLE> How To Get a 100% work-from-home job? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-08 22:02:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **tldr;** I currently work from home 3-4 days/wk and want to move back to my home state without giving up my job that has no *real* reason for me to go into the office. How can I bring this up at work?


**Long version;**
I'm 2 years out of school, and have been working at my current employer for just shy of 1 year (in a week or two it'll be 1 yr). This is on a rolling 6-month contract and I recently just got another extension. I moved fairly far away for this job, about 500 miles, and for many small reasons (very unhappy with my new region) I really want to move back. My actual boss works in a different state, but I still sort-of report to a few managers at my office just as general 'updates' as to what I'm working on and such but they do not delegate any tasks to me at all.

I normally work 3 or 4 days per week from home as is (as do most of the people on my team), but I'll go in on occasion just for a change of pace or if I have one of those menial meetings to attend, or if a big fish from corporate is visiting.

Ultimately though, there's really no major reason I have to be in the office.

I don't really want to look for a new job, my first job out of college lasted a little over a year counting the internship, then this one would only be a year and I'd feel stupid when asked why I'm leaving my answer would be so I could live back in my home area. I'm mostly happy where I work (aside from getting strung along as a contractor, anyways). </TEXT>

I was mostly wondering if, in George's other works, the history of the religion is elaborated anywhere? For example, is this a new religion quickly gaining traction, or has it been around more-or-less as long as 'the old gods and new'? Any general info would be really appreciated.

<TEXT> After a bit of a hiatus from the gym, I'm back at it again :(

One thing that's always given me trouble is after a work out I'm absolutely starving but feel like I shouldn't eat. Generally, I don't do breakfast (or maybe a protein bar from the convenience store at most), have a burger at work, come home and eat dinner then two hours later I'll go to the gym and burn ~600 calories if the tracker of the machines are remotely accurate.

So that's about 1/3 of my daily intake-- actually don't think I even take in 1800. When I get home and relax for thirty minutes, I'm absolutely starving. I feel like I could eat a full second dinner. But then I really don't think I should eat anything because I want to drop 20 pounds by winter (~205 right now)

Just wondering if at some point this goes away as my body gets used to it, or should I just put a little peanut butter on some crackers and deal with it, or...? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went to a three-year college and had a fairly untraditional education and frankly don't think it was a very good one. I've been out of school for two years, my first job was very easy and everyone wrote awful code. Zero separation from UI   logic, it was exactly like what I was doing as a first-year student.

Knowing if I stayed there my skills wouldn't grow at all and I had no where to go (tiny company), I found a better job at a huge, global company.

I've been here for almost a year and in any project I've been assigned I just feel **so** lost. The senior devs on my team don't have a ton of patience for us juniors and it's at the point where I dread having to work with them, but my direct peers can only help so much

No idea what I can do to get better at coding and understanding our software, but as someone who *generally* learns most things in life very quickly I get tremendously frustrated with myself whenever I get stuck with things.

I guess ultimately I'm just wondering of there are any good books for general abstraction principles, design patterns, or just... Anything. I know how to write code, just not good code :P and I'm awful at jumping into existing code and trying to figure it out. </TEXT>

I sort of feel like that's kind of a lame or "girly" spot to get something done until the rest of it is completed, though.

Am I alone in this sentiment, or does anyone else think so? I know ultimately it's my body and I'm not doing it for other people, so I guess I shouldn't care. But I can't help that I do :P

<TEXT> Long story short, my policy was cancelled and I got a thing in the mail from the DMV saying my registration was revoked because insurance is required in my state. I have since purchased a new insurance policy, and they said they'll notify the DMV.

Do I need to go down to the DMV to fill out any paperwork or anything? I really hope I don't have to get new plates =[ </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In my early teens, I had an accident while rollerblading and knocked out my front tooth. I had a fake one molded to my retainer after I had braces, but as I get older I'm sick and tired of wearing a retainer and it was causing physical pain in my mouth. So more of than not I go without it, which leaves me missing one of my front teeth.

On a good day, I'd probably say I'm a 6/10 so this really doesn't help. I've been saving up to get laser eye surgery, but I'm wondering if I should put that money towards a "proper", more permanent solution to my tooth problem instead.

Just curious to get some feedback. </TEXT>

<TEXT> With my stock TPMS, I could get a reading on my front tires but the rear just showed up as --- on the dashboard gauge. Last week I got new wheels and neither the front nor rear are reading. New TPMS sensors that I bought with the wheels. At first I figured it might just take a little but for them to come on, but yesterday I went for a 400+ mile road trip and they still don't work. The low pressure light came on during the trip but it didn't make the chime sound, and my tires are perfectly fine on air.

<TEXT> My new wheels   tires just arrived, and I plan to swing by Lowes in an hour to go grab some white dip and the gloss coat, as well. While watching YouTube videos, I do have a few questions:

* How many cans to expect to go through? 
* How long should I wait in between coats?
* Does the weather effect it? I know that it's generally a poor idea to spray paint in a humid environment, does this have the same problem? 60% Humidity today.
* Most videos seem to focus on the "outside" of the wheel, any special tips for doing the back side or just treat it the same; block off the tires and spray away?
* How long to wait until mounting them to my car?
* How does plastidip handle going through a car wash? I don't have access to do-it-yourself car wash anywhere near me, nor does my apartment have water outside. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been playing Circle lately, but overall not enjoying them and I think I'm going to go back to my first faction-- Cryx.

I wasn't a huge fan of Goreshade 1   2, but 3 seems really interesting.

I know the model hasn't been out for a while, but the rules have been in War Room for a good bit. Has anyone here played with him? How is he? All of my Cryx stuff got damaged months ago and need to be reassembled before I can play them again so I've not tried to proxy a game yet.

I think this is the list I'd want to run:
http://imgur.com/1lecoZS

Lead up with the Bile Thralls, clear as much as I can, get the McThralls in and feat. Follow up with the Brute Thralls for some strong hits, then finally the Banes to do the real heavy lifting. Harrower for the easy stationary hits and slight ranged support. I'd *love* to find a way to fit the Kraken in for fun, but I don't see how I could really afford to :(

Any suggestions / input would be greatly appreciated. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Refinancing an auto loan? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-05 22:30:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I bought my car last year, but because of a low down payment, car's age, and it being my first auto-loan I have a 9 or 10% interest rate, despite having an excellent credit score.

I just got something in the mail, normally I throw all spam out, but this caught my interest. Basically just says you have a great credit score, refinance your loan with us and get "as low as" 3.9% APR.

There's some ID number on the letter saying to go online, enter that, and fill out a form, or call and speak to a sales rep. I hadn't done that because it wanted my SSN and other contact information, which I prefer not to give out to arbitrary companies that mail me things.

Like I said, normally I throw spam out but the way this was packaged piqued my interest (as if that were accidental). Their website looks pretty shitty ( https://www.alliancedirectlending.com/ ) and the fact that it was unsollicited seems kind of shady... But I know I'm getting fucked on my car, but most "regular" banks won't touch it because of its age.

Has anyone heard of this company or been through a similar experience? </TEXT>

I bought BF4 when it first came out. Game was wicked fun, when you could play it. Frequent crashes, server disconnects, inability to queue up for an open slot on the server all ruined it and I stopped playing pretty quickly.

I just found out a laptop I ordered on NewEgg comes with a free copy of BF4 and I was going to give it to my roommate. How much has DICE fixed the game since it launched? I'm at work and can't play, in addition to the fact that I uninstalled it a while ago. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry if this is a really dumb question, complete and total amateur with Photoshop.

I opened up a new file, pasted [this image](http://www.thewarstore.com/media/PIP/PIP34110.jpg) into it and created a new layer on top of it. Set that new layer to be a "Color" blending style. Say I select the Brush tool and the color Red, I can paint over the image to try out different color schemes for the for the models. But if I select Black or White, it just kind of paints a grey line over everything.

How can I accomplish this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> 7 Months ago I moved 400 miles from home to live with my best friend at a new job. Unfortunately (not to sound racist/xenophobic) all of my coworkers are foreign so there's a huge language / culture barrier. I've always had a tough time making new friends, so this has been particularly shitty. Literally the only people I know are my 2 roommates, 1 of whom I'm good friends with and the other I like but I feel like we're only friends because of a mutual friend (the other roommie), and my 4 coworkers.

Both of the roommates are still in school and don't have much money, so they often have no money to do things, and I don't want to pay for them. I don't *mind* paying, but after a few times I feel like I'm just "buying" friends even though one of them is my best friend.

Tonight, I asked if my friend wanted to go out for drinks but he already had plans pending with the other roommate + his coworkers. He (my good friend) said I was welcome to join, but I said no because I feel like a "parasite"-- only invited along because I asked if he wanted to do something unaware of his plans, not because they wanted me to go.

I do have a few hobbies I could theoretically meet people through, but the idea of just going out on my own and trying to get to know people just **seriously** makes me uncomfortable, but I'm going to be alone and unhappy until I do.

I know I need to get out there and meet new people, but I just can't bring myself to do it. For those of you who have been in a similar situation, how the hell do I get over this? I'm sick and tired of spending every night in, but I haven't made a single new friend since I started college 6 years ago and the thought of going out and simply talking to new people scares the shit out of me. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-04-21 16:42:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Now that winter *finally* seems to have passed, planning on buying new tires and wheels to go with. I don't really want to pay all the extra money for a proper powder coat, so I'm considering dipping them, but I don't want a matte color.

* How many cans of paint would be necessary for 4 wheels?
* How many cans of the gloss coat?
* Do you do the same number of coats with the gloss as you do the actual paint?
* Is the primer necessary?

Want to do a gloss white over some 18" T6S's. Also any general tips would be appreciated. I checked out a few videos on YouTube, seems super straight forward, but any tips would be appreciated :) Tires won't be mounted to the wheels yet, so should be nice and easy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm fairly short, or at least have shorter legs. I sit *really* close to the steering wheel because I feel like I'm really over extending my legs to fully engage the pedals and it's very uncomfortable.

I just got my helmet so I can start tracking the car, I didn't realize how... tall it is. Combined with how far forward I sit, there's not much head room and I'm afraid the helmet is going to be knocking against the ceiling (I'm at work and can't go out and sit in the car).

Is it possible to adjust how close / far the pedals are from the rest of the vehicle? That way I could bring them further out, push my seat back and have more room.

Does the Z have a seat height adjuster? I guess I don't remember, how often do you use it after it's been set :p </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I had the opportunity to take my car to a track in Western / Central NY yesterday. 3 laps behind a pace car, took some photos but didn't stay long as it was very far from home:

Sadly I didn't have an opportunity to talk to the GT owner.

Here's a video of my time, as well:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOXdwAAWb34#t=238

I am now aware I am AWFUL at keeping my hands on the wheel and in good form. My glasses kept slipping too. I'm sure my lines were shit too :)

I was tremendously nervous, especially being at the head of the group. I had a CTS-V and a V8 Mustang behind me, and since it was opening weekend we were told no passing so I was afraid I was going to be super slow and ruin it for the guys behind me, but after the first lap or so I couldn't even see the Caddy in my mirrors at any point, so that helped relief a little "stress".

Best time I've had in a very long time, hope to get some proper time on the track this year without a safety car :) </TEXT>

It was $25 for 3 laps with a pace car... Did 40-80 mph depending on where on the track I was. It was insanely fun for my first time experience. I was extremely nervous because I was leading the pack, only the pace car infront of me, I was afraid I was going to be so slow and piss off everyone behind me but after the first lap I couldn't even see the Caddy behind me from that first photo :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys, like many others I was disappointed with the D3 launch and played PoE quite a bit as an alternative with **much** more depth. I really liked it, but something felt missing and I never got past level 50 or maybe 60.

Took a break probably around December last year, played a few other games and decided to give Reaper of Souls a chance. Much improved, but D3 is still very heavily one of those "The illusion of choice" kind of games, and I think I'm going to jump back into PoE.

I know an expansion came out a little while ago, but other than that is there anything really new in the PoE world / community? A big part of my issue was just being overwhelmed with the passive tree and not being able to come up with a build I liked, getting to mid/late game and realizing my character is garbage and needing to restart. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm by no means a great cook, but I'll do more than just freezer meals and garbage like that for my dinners. I've been getting better at coming up with stuff to do with my chicken, beef, steak, but I'm at a complete loss on how to make my veggies more "interesting".

This is probably a sin to say here, but I don't notice a difference between fresh, garden-fresh or frozen so I just buy frozen since it's easier. Usually get an assortment of peas, green beans, carrots, corn and sometimes broccoli. Generally just toss it in a bowl with a little bit of water and whatever seasoning I put on my meats. Add a pinch of butter afterwards, but it still usually just tastes *so* bland.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been single for a little over two years, now. Took me quite a while to get over it, first-and-only relationship of nearly 5 years. Probably about a year ago, maybe a little less, I signed up for OKC and POF. I've had absolutely no luck; the ones I message don't respond and the very few (3, maybe 4) that message me I haven't been interested in. I have had one semi meaningful extended conversation and that was because I wanted to give someone "a fair shot" after she messaged me and she was very clearly not over her ex so after two weeks I stopped talking.

In my profile I made mention that I moved to where I now live for work, and I worry that comes off like I'm some cocky big shot? I don't know.  I'm certainly no Adonis, but I wouldn't say I'm down right unattractive either. I try to send meaningful messages asking questions about things they mentioned in their profile rather than just a "Hi" or other brain dead sentence.

 Meanwhile my good friend has had fairly good success in just a few months, having been on a few dates in a short amount of time. Fruitless in the end, but it's better than nothing. I would say he is much more attractive, and I'm starting to get depressed thinking it is truly that simple. I understand everyone wants someone attractive, but both my "failures" and his success combined is really getting me down lately.


Sorry if this post sounds whiny, but I just don't understand. I've mostly got my shit together but no one will give me a chance.  I'm just tired not having anyone to talk to about my day, or listen to how their day was, etc.

**TL;DR** When you ladies get a message, really, what determines if you reply to them? Or I guess perhaps more importantly what would make you **not** reply? </TEXT>

It's an '03 350Z. The front bumper, the lowest part, is FULL of rock chips. It looks like it's been through hell. The hood has a suffered a small chip this winter, probably the size of a penny. You can very clearly see the silver / metal of the car. There are also 3 very very small scraps on the roof that have actually started to rust a little bit because I've been unable to get it taken care of this winter.

Just wondering if you guys think I should take it to a professional body shop, get the paint taken care of THEN have it detailed? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I've never been into cars until I bought this a year ago, now I absolutely love it and want to learn as much as I can. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-03-22 22:17:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My dad and I have never been close. As a young child he mostly travelled for a living. As I got older (10+), he got a new job where he mostly worked 6AM-2PM or so, would come home from work and nap for a few hours, cook dinner when I got home from school (on the nights that my mother worked, anyways) then he'd just go downstairs and drink and watch TV. I don't want to say he was an alcoholic, but... well.. he was. He wasn't physically abusive, and not really verbally abusive, just an asshole when he was drunk. 

He kept some part-time hours at his old job, and would usually work from about 4 AM - 11PM on Saturdays. Sunday's he'd mostly spend either sleeping, or doing chores around the house.

He always put the family first, I know that, and I respect his work ethic but I feel like I don't know him as a person at all. He never expressed interest in anything I've ever been into and doesn't seem to express interest in anything himself.

Six months ago I took a job 400 miles away from home, as a software developer. Both of my parents are quite technologically "illiterate" and don't really understand what I do, despite my best efforts to try and explain.

So, anyways, he called me the other night because he just wanted to  say hi but it's so painful for me, because we have the most unnatural and forced conversations. It doesn't help that I have nothing to talk about. My life equates to going to work, playing video games / surfing the internet, and then go to bed and repeat. His is basically go to work, do whatever needs to be done around the house, and sleep. Frankly, I don't think either of us are particularly happy people.

Sorry this was such a massive wall of text, I didn't really know how to sum up my dad's life and my life in short. It's just that my family has basically disowned my brother and I'm all they have, and it pains me that he and I barely even have that... But I have absolutely no idea how to change? I've really never been good with people in general. Have always had trouble making friends and talking to people in life.


**tl;dr** My father and I both lead dull, boring lives and have never been close. I have no idea who he is as a person and don't know how to connect with him. After moving far from home for work I want to improve this, but don't know how. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been single for about 2 years now, and have had minimal luck with dating sites. I think my standards are too high, and I don't know if that's "wrong" of me or not.

What do you guys look for?

For me, the big things are:

* No kid
* Doesn't smoke (I guess I'd be ok with pot in small amounts)
* In college or working something other than retail
* Nonreligious

As I grow older, it's hard to find someone who doesn't have a kid it seems like. I'm awful with kids though, and I don't really know if I want them myself. The third and forth ones I debate whether or not I should be more lenient here because I don't even know what I want from a woman. If I want kids, I sort of like the idea of a stay-at-home mom... But on the other hand, I want someone career oriented so I'm not the only one bringing in money. It seems like every on OKC/POF wants to be a hair stylist or something and for some reason that's just  a turn off for me. I know it's judgemental but I assume they're just some superficial ditzy bimbo. As far as religion goes, I'm (obviously) not religious and I certainly couldn't date someone who is very religious but I don't know about the people who believe in God but don't go to church and won't get upset over trivial things.

Part of me feels guilty over 3 and 4, but then I also think to myself that if I'm looking to spend a significant amount of time and energy with someone, it should be someone I truly want to be with, right? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is kind of a weird post, but I don't really know where else to go. All my life I've struggled with motivation, the bare minimum has been enough to get by. Whatever grade I got in school was always "Good enough" for me, so long as I passed. I know I'm smart, I know I have potential but I just don't care. I'm so overwhelmingly apathetic in absolutely everything in my life.

Lately, I've been working from home almost every day of the week "because of the bad weather", but really that's just an excuse because I'm so fucking depressed I don't ever want to leave my room. I use the term working loosely, as this is the real problem; I barely get anything done at all and am falling behind on my work quite a bit. I know it's a problem, but I just can't motivate myself to do anything. The only reason I'm even awake at this hour of the night is because I'm so stressed out on this project I can't sleep. I'm afraid I could lose my job as I'm a contractor, yet here I am poking around on Reddit instead of doing something about it.

I know I need professional help but I can't get health insurance for *at least* a month to do anything about it. I don't know. I'm just sick and tired of wishing I'd die in some freak accident, starting to feel like I need to do better, I deserve better, but I just can't... What the fuck can I do? I just want to get on with my life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently moved here and I've been struggling to find a good, proper breakfast diner. I don't Denny's, I don't want Ihop. I tried The Original Pancake House, or whatever it's called, last week and was thoroughly disappointed. The food wasn't bad, but it was insanely expensive. $5 for 4 slices of bacon? C'mon.

Back home, we had this restaurant called [Carl's Diner](https://www.google.com/search?q=carl%27s+diner+oxford safe=off espv=210 es_sm=93 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=S4gcU-PAL6y6yAGwtoHICw ved=0CAoQ_AUoAg biw=1680 bih=959) and that is the amount of food you'd get. The portions were huge, everything was greasy and disgusting and **delicious**. Your meal came with hashbrowns. Your side came with a side of hashbrowns. It was so much food for the price.

It was kind of a mom-and-pop atmosphere, even though the owner was never physically there. But it was a small staff that knew everyone (I guess this is just the nature of a tiny town though) but man I miss it. This isn't necessarily "crucial" to what I'm looking for, but I find its these kinds of places that are more generous with food.

Anyone know of a place like this? I live right near the Target / Best Buy plaza on the Boulevard so the closer to there the better :)

<TEXT> Hey guys, I just started playing D3 again to try out 2.0 and see if I wanted Reaper of Souls. 

Anyways, here's [my Barbarian](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/profile/StakOverfl%C3%B6-1324/hero/739). It's not great, but my gear was complete shit before I quit.

I'm trying out this HP Regen / Lifesteal WW build. Currently, I regen 3,890 HP/S + 512 per Rend target and then 1024 HP per Crit of Whirlwind.

It seems to be going fairly well, I'm comfortable in Torment 2 but I don't stand a chance in Torment 3.

I think I want to swap out Grim Harvest for a more useful skill but I don't know what. I'm thinking Wrath of the Berserker with either Insanity (+50% Damage) or Thrive on Chaos (another +826 Life per Fury Spent) while I blender mans.

I know I drastically need more Crit chance for WW, but other than I'm not really sure how to improve this character other than hoping to get more Life on Hit and more Damage. Is attack speed at all important for a WW-oriented build?

<TEXT> I live in New York state. I was hired as a contract employee for a large financial institution (placed by a staffing agency). My paychecks come from the staffing agency, but I believe after a year of employment the financial institution says I have to take a week off "because everyone deserves a vacation". This means I'd be missing out a week's pay since I don't get any benefits.

My annual anniversary isn't for a few months, but I was wondering if they can actually require me to *not* work. While I can afford to go without pay, I'd much rather not to if I don't have to. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I grew up a giant nerd, happy to stay in and play video games 'til my fingers would fall off, but more and more I find myself bored and frustrated with games. I *want* to enjoy them but I just don't have fun 9/10 times anymore.

With this severe winter we're having I find myself with some pretty serious cabin fever; I work from home most days and then spend all my time off at home still. Going insane with nothing to do, and I just moved to a new city where I only have 1 friend so if he doesn't feel like going out I have no one to talk to or do things with.

So I guess I'm just looking for new hobbies-- what do you do and what do you enjoy about it, men of reddit? </TEXT>

I don't know much at all about jewelry, but I've decided I want a ring. I've been scouring the internet for something like the one I linked above, except with the gold on the "outside" and an inner band of black tungsten.

I've seen a lot with either silver, white gold, or just steel on the outter parts but I don't think that's what I want.

Any advice for a total jewelry noob? </TEXT>

I found this from Kay's:

Basically I'm looking a nice onyx band with 2 thin strips of gold around it... Can't seem to find anything free of tacky tribal engravings on the band or anything.

I don't really care if it's fake, so long as it looks good. Was hoping someone here might be able to point me in the right direction for a total jewelry-noob. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not a big City Builder kind of guy, but I decided to pick this game up on a whim. It's been pretty fun and I really don't have any complaints (aside from the lack of native Borderless Window) and while I've logged about 10 hours in a short amount of time (for me) I don't necessarily feel *compelled* to play it.

I was just wondering if someone could explain why they think the game is so great? The last city builder I played was Sim City, which was just abysmal. So coming from that to this, I'm wondering if other people got burned and are just happy to have something actually functional, or if I'm just missing something. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tax return season! Looking to get new wheels, but I don't know how to find tires that will fit?

I'm looking at these: http://www.conceptzperformance.com/Cart/description.php?II=4349 Car_Type=350Z UID=2014021808453376.180.32.126

19x9.5 in the front, 19x10.5 in the rear. But then any tire site has you enter your vehicle, or tire size... But I don't know what size would fit those wheels. Is it just a matter of converting from inch to mm for the width?

I know TireRack has wheel and tire combos, I suppose if I just find some wheels that are the same size then any matching tire should work for the Varrstoen right? </TEXT>

<TITLE> What debt do I pay off first? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-02-17 15:07:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Quick run down of my debts:

* $5,604.84 @ **8%** (Private student loan #1)
* $5,730.95 (unsure of percent) (Private student loan #2)
* $10,014.96 (unsure of percent) (Private student loan in mother's name)
* $10,864.62 @ **9%** (auto loan)
* $24,559.35 ranging from **3.4% - 6.8%** (Federal student loans)

The $24.5K in Federal loans is an assortment of 10 smaller loans averaging about $2K each.

The car loan is $270/mo but I pay an extra $150 towards the premium. 

I've got about another $18K in student loans, so combined they work out to about $1K/mo (can't log in to the website to get the actual balance).

I make $1001 per week.

At the end of this month I should have about $5.7K or so in the bank.

I was hoping someone could provide some insight as to which debt I should pay down first, or what to do with my money.

* On one hand, I want to pay off my car, since it's the highest interest rate and if I need to sell it in a pinch for whatever reason that money will go to me rather than the bank
* On the other hand, I just want to chip away at as much of this $65K in student debt as possible, since to my understanding you cannot be absolved from student debt even if you go bankrupt.
* On the other other hand, perhaps I should invest? As Tesla breaks $200 last week I'm kicking myself in the ass for not buying as much of it as I could when I wanted to at $50/share last year.
* Forth, put a chunk into my IRA. I'm a contract worker and get 0 benefits, so I haven't made a contribution to my retirement in a while.
* Final option is to simply sit on the money. Play it safe, hold on to it as a rainy-day-fund in case my contract doesn't get extended (the IT job market in this city is pretty shit if I were to become unemployed). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Despite being a tech enthusiast, I jumped on the smart phone wagon pretty late. I've had my Galaxy Nexus for a little over a year and a half now, and it's physically deteriorating so I just ordered a 32 GB Nexus 5 from Google.

I use Straight Talk as my provider,  I was just wondering if I'll need to do anything but pop the SIM card out of my GNex and put it into the 5?

What's the best way to transfer pictures / apps over?

edit; 10 AM EST, Google says it'll "Leave the warehouse by the 7th" and I paid for Overnight shipping so it'd presumably arrive on Monday.... I had it shipped to my parents house in a different state since I'll be visiting this weekend-- think it'll ship before the 7th? I don't want to pay for them to overnight it to me if it arrives after I leave :( </TEXT>

Dealership told me they were new and the treads look to be in fine shape, though they're in plastic bags right now so I can't check exactly how much is left. Just finally got winter tires last week, and when the spring rolls around I hope to have some aftermarket wheels + new tires. Would love to offset that cost by selling my old tires.

$300 for all four? I have no idea.

Edit; Despite the thread title, I meant selling just the tires. I'll be keeping the stock wheels for winter tires, aftermarket wheels for summer/performance tires.

Edit2; They are Milestar MS932's. Goddamn, they are cheap as Dirt-- Amazon sells 'em for [$81](http://www.amazon.com/Milestar-MS932-225-45R18-24990003/dp/B0083TOAX8). Guess I won't be able to get much of anything huh? </TEXT>

I like the firsst list because it has more dogs.. But no stones. Second list picks up a Gorax and stones, but fewer dogs :(

**Edit** Actually, I'd probably drop Gorax for the Skinwalker UA and a second set of stones in that second list. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Car noob; It's about 10F outside, just went to leave for work. Put my key in, turn it on and everything gets power. Try to actually turn my key and you just hear that churning sound and it won't actually start. I'm coming up on 58K miles or soand since I've owned the car I've had no issues (only been 10K miles since I bought it). The volt meter gauge on the dash shows my battery looks fine, though my stereo head unit was reset (colors changed, indicating it lost power / I need to reconfigure it).

Fucking freezing out so I didn't want to sit out there and tinker with it too much. Let me know what other info you guys might need :)

Can't tell super well because of the lighting, but no matter what angle I set the disc to / how I rotate the actual binding, I cannot get the screw by the front left to line up. And then the other two certainly don't come close.

I also tried the "3D" disc the Customs came with, no luck. What embarassingly-stupid thing am I doing wrong? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys, I've been out of the loop for close to a decade now. Just getting back into boarding for the winter now that I moved to somewhere with actual mountains.

I'm 5'8", male, about 200 lbs... Looking for a cheaper-ish setup for non-park use. That said, I usually spent my time just doing flatground tricks down the mountain and manuals and stuff, just kind of dicking around and having fun as most of my friends were slower. So flexibility is somewhat important but don't need something too crazy. I prefer a slightly shorter board than normal.

Here's what I pieced together;

* [Forum Scallywag 155](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/ProductDisplay?langId=-1 storeId=10208 catalogId=10000001 partNumber=10212707 cmCat=)

* [ThirtyTwo Summit boots](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/ProductDisplay?langId=-1 storeId=10208 catalogId=10000001 partNumber=10224997 cmCat=)

Comes out to just under $500. Anything particularly shitty about these? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Winter time's coming here in Buffalo with a few inches of snow tonight. I ordered 4 winter tires from Sears at the beginning of the month and after 2 weeks they were clueless as to where they were. Cancelled my order and got a refund, looking at tires again online. TireRack can get me 4 Blizzak's for $800 shipped, but I *really* don't want to spend that kind of money, especially since I can just work from home if I need to.

But at the same time, I don't want my baby to wind up in a ditch because I cheaped out. Considering compromising and getting just 2 winter tires for the rear so I can actually get going. Bad idea, or...? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is sort of a dumb question, and I'm pretty sure the answer is no... But with a RWD vehicle are you going to feel it more when there are really strong winds?

Getting 30 MPH winds with gusts up to 50 MPH today and I'm feeling it *way* more in my 350Z than I ever felt wind in my Corolla before this. Like to the point where I'm not sure if it's just the wind or something's up with my rear tire(s). It feels like the car is seriously pulling to the side. I've only had the vehicle for a few months so I'm not totally at the point of knowing every noise and feel of the car, ya know?

Also just wonder if I'm overly paranoid because everyone says how 'bad' RWD is for handling, so maybe I'm just being overly attentive to every single thing I feel? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2013-09-03 22:41:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I might be buying a second car for the winter season soon, looking for suggestions.

I'll be in Buffalo which gets lots of snow from the great lakes obviously. I'll primarily use it to drive to   from work (10 minute drive), but on the weekends I'll take it to the mountain about an hour away as well.

So AWD and space for a snowboard + skis (and gear for two, maybe 3) is a must. Oh and must be manual. Heated leather is very much desired but not a deal breaker.

I don't have an exact budget just yet because I'll just be saving up money as soon as I start working, but anywhere from $3-8k probably.

My first thought was Reddit's favorite, a WRX wagon, but anything in that price range will have such an astronomical amount of miles. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I just got a new job making almost double what I do now. Next year assuming my contact gets renewed I can't think of anything I'd like to do more than buy an e30 and fix her up.

Depending on how bad it is, would it be feasible to get the car in tip-top shape for under $10K? I should mention I have zero tools and no know-how, but what better way to learn than by doing? How tough would it be to get parts? Since this is far off, anyone able to recommend some reading material to get started with?

I don't have an exact vision of what I want in the end, I suppose. I DD a 350Z right now (but I'll probably get an old beater to DD since I'm going somewhere with bad winters) so I don't necessarily need a "replacement" sports car. Not sure how frequently I'll be able to get to the track with this new location either. I think I mostly just want a cool car that I can say I built. I know I at least want to paint it white with the classic 3 stripes with the M colors [kind of like this](http://forums.pelicanparts.com/uploads7/3+21+06+0151142981797.jpg) </TEXT>

Realistically, how expensive would it be to buy an old E30 to fix it up? Also, I have no experience working on cars so this would also serve to get me familiar with everything.

Of course I won't rush into this before I've really "stabilized" with the job and know I'll be there for a while, but hypothetically could anyone ballpark a figure assuming I spend about $3K on the vehicle. Could it be done for $10K?

USD of course. </TEXT>

2 pictures:

He caused the scuff going down the bumper and 2 actual chips in the paint where the bumper meets the rest of the body, then one at the end of the scuff mark.

Unless he has some outrageously low deductible, I don't think the damage will be high enough to exceed whatever his deductible is and I know he can't afford however much it would be to get fixed professionally. He said he'll buy some touch up paint and clean it up for me, but I'm really pissed. I know it's a 10 year old car and there are fair amount of rock chips in it as is, but damn it, I worked my ass off for this car. I don't want to be a dick and go and impose some sort of financial stress on the guy who pays part of my rent... but fuck :(

<TEXT> When I bought my car, the windows were already tinted a little bit but there was some damage to the film on the driver's side. I want to get it replaced and possibly darkened as well.

Found [this](http://www.tintlaws.com/) site that says in MA you need to allow 35% light through. Problem is, I drive in RI 99% of the time and that site says RI requires 70% light. Even though my car is registered in MA, can I get a ticket if I had a much darker tint?

On a similar note, because I basically live in RI (but MA plates / license / registration) I usually don't jump on getting my state inspection done as soon as it's up. RI does have state inspections as well, but can they give me a ticket for an out of date, out of state one?

Lich2, Denny1, Mortenebra, Goreshade 2 I think (never run him, not sure)

**Heavy Jacks:**
Slayer, Seether, Deathjack, Nightmare

**Solos**
BLT, Warwitch Siren, 2 Pistol Wraiths, Skarlock Thrall


I kind of want to buy the Witch Coven, and a bunch of Pirates or Ogrun stuff but I have no idea how effective any of them are (I never see them at my shop). Really not a big fan of the Satyxis stuff. Mostly curious if the Ogrun   Slaughterborn are good to run with Denny I guess? I feel like they probably need Skarre to keep them safe with Occulation, 12/15 isn't hard to take off the table. </TEXT>

Go on over to Invidia's website to check out their prices and they have 3 options;

* Rolled stainless steel tips
* Rolled titanium tips
* Single layer titanium


But they're all the same price. Is there any functional differences, or is it all just sound? Any info  / advice would be great :D

Long time gamer (who isn't), but lately I find I just cannot play anything for more than an hour or two. I have a huge catalog of games where I've said, "I can't wait for this to come out!" and then I get maybe half way through and lose interest.

Because of my inability to be captivated by a game recently, and my need to better myself as a code monkey I've decided to start dabbling in game development. I've been consuming a lot of videos on Unity as a starting point, but I find myself struggling to flesh out any idea or element for projects I want to do.

I was wondering what motivates or inspires you guys to go and do what you do? I feel like a kid staring at a blank word document with writers block trying to do a paper for school all over again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, some extra financial roadbumps reared its ugly head so I guess I won't be going to Limerock next month :(

Found a club that does autocross that's much closer to me but their website was a little lacking. I suppose it varies from club to club, but do you need a helmet or anything special for autocross? This will be my first time doing anything other than driving on public roads with my car. Top off my fluids, make sure my tires are full, fresh brake pads.... Anything else I should know? </TEXT>

Pulled in to work and the motor died for my passenger side window... with the window down... Then it started raining and hasn't stopped since.

Luckily it's still under warranty from the dealer and I'll be taking it back tomorrow but god damn am I unhappy :(

Had the driver side replaced when I bought it.

On the upshot, I live in a kind of crappy part of town and no one broke in and stole my head unit over night, woo. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I might finally have the cash to take my car out to Lime Rock next month! Extremely excited, but I'm curious what sort of helmets /r/cars prefers (for those who have been to a track).

-I would like to get a full-face helmet with a proper visor, just for the extra protection should something happen, but I'm worried it would fog up? I used to snowboard, wearing goggles over my glasses was near impossible. Obviously there's much more space with a proper helmet though so I don't know if that would be issue.

-Also, how the hell do you know what size to buy? I'm only 5'8", so I assume a Medium would be fine but I don't know.

-Lastly, does anyone know of a place to rent GoPros and mounts? I'd love to have at least one for the event, but I can't warrant spending $200+ on a camera I might use once or twice per year. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey loseit, I think I've finally hit "rock bottom". I'm almost 23 and I haven't seriously exercised since I was a freshman in high school. I did go to the gym for 1 summer in college, but that was about it... Anyways, I've started walking 2 miles per day and as of yesterday I started 4 miles per day-- 2 before work, 2 after work.

I'm feeling pretty good about it, and I think each week I'm going to tack on half a mile extra per session. The only problem I have, even when I was in good shape I've always been poor at long distance, my ankles seem to get really sore really easily. But we'll see.

My biggest problem with overcoming my weight is my diet. I eat out frequently and when I do "cook" it's usually just throwing a pizza in the oven.

I'm a 5'8", 220 lb (1.7 meters / 100 kg) male. I don't know... anything about the "healthy eating" aspect to weight loss. I mean, obvious fresh meats and vegetables are better than Burger King and I should cut back on carbs, but other than I know nothing. Where can I start reading up on this stuff? How about healthy, easy foods to cook? Really any advice at all. </TEXT>

<TITLE> ELI5: I don't know anything about retirement accounts </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-07-16 17:51:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, where to start. I graduated and started working full time at the end of last year. My company opened a SEP IRA account with TD Ameritrade for me and I've been paying in to it for about 5.5 months now. I just logged in and have no idea what I'm looking at, but I was expecting about $2k.

It's about 3/4 of that instead. I really don't understand how it all works, and both my parents have always been pretty low-earners, under the table. Don't think either of them have much of a retirement plan at all...

So, anyways:

* Why is my balance much lower than what I've paid into it
* I understand there's significant tax penalties for withdrawing money before I'm 59.5 years old, would I still pay out the ass if I wanted to invest in stock *through* TD Ameritrade?
* What else do I need to know? :/

A few months ago I really wanted to buy some Tesla, but I didn't have a dime to spare aside from what was in my IRA. Really would've liked to buy a bunch because it's more than doubled since I started following it :(

edit; Another question. It looks like I can only contribute no more than $5,500 annually to my IRA. Does that include my employer's contributions too? We just got "raises" this week but instead the employer is just going to pay more into our accounts instead. I'll be extremely close to that $5,500 limit with the new rates then. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Recently, every now and again when I put it into first and start going, I'll really feel my car kind of vibrate like it's not getting enough gas and is about to stall. The clutch pedal has also be noisy but not every time I engage it. I'm pretty sure I'm still giving it enough gas to get it up to at least 1.5k RPM, and maybe I'm just being overly paranoid but it's been freaking me out. Doesn't happen often and when it has I haven't looked down fast enough to see exactly what RPM I'm at.

I bought the car at 49k miles, it now has 54k and I got my oil changed at 52 with some mobil one synthetic. Any other routine maintenance I should do around this time? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I got a nice chip from a rock the other day, put a sizable chunk in my hood and apparently on my roof which I never noticed. Was getting in my car yesterday and I noticed some rust.

When I bought the car in February I was a sap and bought the paint sealant protection package for $300 because the car looked immaculate on the lot despite being an '03. Here it is not 5 months later and now this. I plan on calling the dealership tomorrow to see if they'll cover it, but I really don't think they will. The terms explicitly states they don't cover a handful of things, one of which being chips from rocks. My roommate, who generally knows more about autobody than I do, says it definitely shouldn't have rusted as quickly as it did (only the roof did, the hood is OK) and that they should fix it.

I suppose I may as well call them up and see what they say (150 miles away, fuck). Pretty sure I'm SOL, so if that's the case, what can I do to protect my baby? Just grab some touch up paint and cover the spots? Anything I need to know about applying the stuff?

<TEXT> So I've always been a gamer growing up, playing tons of different titles. I also wouldn't consider myself a "casual" gamer in any sense, but lately, I just can't get into most games. I've been routinely playing DOTA 2, but with other games... I never finished BioShock Infinite. I never finished the Dishonored DLC. I have to force myself to play The Last Of Us and even then I can't play more than an hour or so. I bought Alan Wake on sale the other weekend and have barely touched it. I don't think I made it past level 20 or so in Borderlands.

I just have no desire to play most games, even though I was highly anticipating them. Anyone else feel this way lately? I don't know if I just need to take a break and come back for a while, but so few titles interest me and it makes me sad that I don't enjoy them. </TEXT>

I'm pretty sure there's nothing I can do about the first one, it looks to be a pretty serious chip in the hood. How about the second blemish? No matter how much I wash, it doesn't go away.

There's also a ton of white specks on the front bumper, presumably just from rocks chipping away... Anything I can do to prevent that? :( </TEXT>

I know you really don't need to change the oil every 3k, but I decided I would since I don't know what type of oil the previous owner used (I bought synthetic), when their last change was since I bought it from the dealership or anything...

So anyways, so I have no experience working on cars. Take the jack out of the back and prop up my car but I couldn't get it high enough to really be able to do a damn thing. I was wondering if there's just a different, better jack I can buy or something? What do you guys do?

I ended up taking it to a garage, which actually worked out for the best- they noticed my serpentine belt was pretty worn down. $20 for the labor-only oil change and $160 for the belt and replacement, not awful. I was going on a 400 mile trip the following day, so... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello /r/tattoos! I got my first (and only) tattoo four years ago as a birthday gift to myself. No regrets yet. It's a simple armband that says "I am sorry for all the things we did and did not do", then on the outter part of my bicep I have [this](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_M9HNyHQCPhc/R2f6Kf18WcI/AAAAAAAAACQ/yPyYgeAYOew/s320/BE+PAIN+OF+SALV.jpg). Whole thing is black, no 'background' or anything.

I am NOT an artist in any sense of the word, but here's a mock-up of what I want to get done;

http://i.imgur.com/imV95Vz.png

Basically it's a compilation of other favorite musicians' logos inside of bubbles from a bearded fish. Again that is just a very rough mock up, I'll have a professional designer come up with something / see what the tattoo artist can draw up for me.

My big issue is that that arm band I have now is right in the "center" of my bicep, and I'm afraid if I have this below my current tattoo it will look weird as the fish would probably wind up in my "elbow pit" for lack of a better term. Any thoughts / ideas? I want to have the bubbles leading up that circular emblem I have now as the 'final' bubble. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys, quick question I had about some wheels I want to buy:

http://www.amazon.com/Enkei-Matte-Black-Wheels-473-880-8040BK/dp/B007OWUIZY

Amazon says they should fit my '03, eBay says they don't. No idea...

If those don't fit, then I'm looking at thees:

Although again I'm finding conflicting info from websites saying they do or don't match. I like these a lot less though :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course it varies from school to school, but lately I've been wanting to take some advanced courses that let you get out on an airport or track and really experience your vehicle. But they're like $200+ for a few hours.  Have any of you guys done them? Do they really teach anything I can't learn just by reading and dicking around in a parking lot at 2 AM?

I might call my insurance company and see if they'd pay for it since I could argue it'd make me a better driver? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Moving to the Boston area, advice / info about nearby towns? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-04-02 16:17:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I recently got a job interview with a company up in Wilmington, MA. I grew up right on the tri-state border about 20 minutes South of Worcester. I've been to Boston a number of times, as a tourist, but I know very little about Eastern MA. What are some of the nicer towns in the region, without costing too much? I pay $400/mo in Student Loans and about $270 on a car payment.

I was just hoping to get any advice on where I should look into, where I should stay away from, etc. Salary looks like I should be making close to $40k assuming 30% goes to taxes, which is as much as I make pre-tax now, to give you guys a budget idea.

I'm open to the idea of living in Boston if commuting isn't horrible. Or a nearby small-ish town. I currently live in a shittier neighbor in a small city; 30k sq/m with 80k people and it's not too bad. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Right now, I'm a full-fledged software engineer for a small company. I do everything; front end, back end, technical support, training, customer relations. Everything. My duties are, basically, the same as they were when I was an intern, and are the same as my peers in almost every aspect. It's a pretty relaxed environment, jeans and t-shirt kind of place. I really like it. But there is zero room for growth. Hypothetically, if I were still here in 10 years I'd be doing exactly what I'm doing now. Half of the employees still use a dead language I've never heard of until I started here.


I just applied to a company I already interviewed with months ago, and I was certain I was going to get the job until at the last minute they couldn't afford someone new at the time. This is a Tier II internal help desk role. It's quite the jump backwards on the proverbial corporate ladder, and a lot less responsibility (though frankly that's okay with me).

I'm pretty underpaid where I am now, so I'd imagine this new job will probably pay the same, and have room for actual advancement in the future. Do you guys think it would be wise to do it, or stay where I am now and get more experience as a full on developer, even though it's not great experience because I don't have a mentor or anything? </TEXT>

I'd like something a little more... refined/classy looking that won't distract me?

If we can keep the price under $200 that's great, but I can go up to $300.

Edit; Well I ended up with a Kenwood DPX-300U that I'm pretty UNhappy with, device keeps dying on me despite the shop saying the ground wire is fine / fuse is fine... so I'm probably going to return it and buy something else. </TEXT>

Depending on where it hit, what would that do to our economy?

<TEXT> I was supposed to look at a Z last weekend but due to the snow storm I wasn't able to. Went down today, [I can't stop thinking about it](http://i.imgur.com/OzZOnIg.jpg). Sadly I didn't get a chance to drive it, they were just about to roll it in to the service station to put new tires on it they told me. It still needs to be detailed but it looks to be in pretty good condition, a few minor scratches but nothing serious.

After some re-evaluation of my budget (trade-in wasn't worth as much as I hoped), I think I can still afford it and I HOPE to buy it Friday or Saturday. Anything I should know about RWD? I've only ever driven FWD before. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi /r/350z . I've been looking to get one for the past few months now and I think o finally found a good deal. I'm up in MA, found an '03 Enthusiast with under 50k miles. They're asking $12.5k for it and I'm hoping to talk them down to $11k since it's winter time. I'm aware of the tire issues some of the '03-'05 have, but I wonder if something else is up? Seems pretty cheap for such low mileage.

Edit; I'm going to the dealership Saturday to check it out. Their reviews on cars.com (where I found the listing) were few but pretty poor. Someone called me this morning from the dealership (sent an email last night) and he said they have all the service records/ carfax.  What else should I be aware of? This is my first time buying a car from a dealership

Edit x2; RED FLAG? Found the car fax for the car online;
http://imgur.com/GLQvX3U
Is it possible the tech who did the inspection pressed the wrong keys for the mileage? Or is it possible the dealer did that... </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been looking into buying a 350z for a few months now, and I find a problem I'm having is so many of them in my price range have been lowered a lot. Not only do I personally think this looks awful, but in my particular location it's a pretty poor choice. I was wondering, is it expensive to pay a mechanic to raise a car back to its factory specs? Of course, everywhere differs in price, but if it were only a few hundred dollars I'd be okay with buying one like that. Unfortunately I work all the hours any garage is open, so I can't just call and ask around :( </TEXT>

What can I do to protect myself /ensure the car is decent? The car is sold by a very large company, not a private sale. It's also used, 2003 but only 60K miles on it.

So if you've bought a car off eBay, please, share your experiences. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I graduate very soon, and I'm kind of considering buying myself a nice car as a graduation gift (I will be the first person in my *extended* family to have a degree). A 2003 Nissan 350Z for $16k, 50k miles on it and it looks like its in great shape. I currently drive an '03 Toyota Carolla with 125k miles on it and while there's nothing wrong with it, I want something I LOVE to drive because its something I enjoy doing. Anyways, the main reason I'm posting this is because I've never actually bought a car.
