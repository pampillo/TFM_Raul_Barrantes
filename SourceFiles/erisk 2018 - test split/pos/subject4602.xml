<TITLE> Come share your rush story! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-04 12:34:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Personally, I got into them in the winter of 8th grade on 12/21/14. I remembered seeing a tweet from Dan Avidan from Game Grumps the year prior talking about a Rush fandom holiday. I decided to dig out my dad's 2112 CD and was instantly hooked. I probably listened to that thing almost 100 times!

Then I listened to Signals and Subdivisions connected with me like nothing ever before had. I felt comfort in the fuckfest that was my life. This album solidified my love of Rush.

Then I got tickets to R40 the day of my final show with the Michigan Honor's Choir. My dad showed me Witch Hunt on the way home and we extended our drive home by taking backroads so we could bond more over Rush, specifically Subdivisions.

Another major bonding event was my family's road trip to Florida in which my dad and I spent a large chunk of the driving listening to Rush. I'll never forget when he first played Manhattan Project for me. Or when we stayed up at night after I ate some bad food and watched Rush In Rio.

2 years in and I'm still just as hooked. Because of Rush I've minimized suicidal tendencies, become a bass player (I can play YYZ too!), become mod of this wonderful community (one of my proudest achievements), and abandoned my old life that had hurt me more by the day. Without them I don't know where I'd be, but I know it'd be worse.

So thank you, Rush, for helping me through the hardest part of life so far.

And thank you, Rush fans. You're the family that accepted me with all my flaws when I needed it most and are probably the greatest and loveliest fan base ever.

Cheers! 3 </TEXT>

<TEXT> I honestly agree. There was the one guy who had every Rush ad ever and it's like, I've come across some that I snag, if I see a Rush record I'll most likely buy it, but what the hell do you do to afford/have time for that?! I mean there was the one awesome girl who runs Rushcon that worked for the president, and she I can understand, but most of the other guys. Like the one who offhandedly mentioned how he saw 30 shows on the Clockwork Angels tour. How do you afford that?! That's still at least $1800 for only bare minimum tickets with no fees and excluding travel. What the hell?! I'm totally not jealous or anything... </TEXT>

<TITLE> Best Rush live album? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-01 23:14:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I think definitely Snakes And Arrows Live for its variety, production, and crowd noises. It sounds really good and has my favorite versions of many songs.

On the other hand, A Show Of Hands is really cool and has a rad extended version of Closer To The Heart. Maybe it isn't as good as the versions on some bootlegs that I know (Philly show from Counterparts tour) but it's definitely great. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This song is badass and almost reminds me of Muse. And by that I mean it sounds like Neil heard something by Muse and said "I like it, let's play with it" and that isn't bad! The dissonance is used as a key feature in the song and it works. The clashing notes sound just as melodic as any other song.

In my eyes they perfected the Vapor Trails sound here. And those bass runs from the end of the live version before they play one of their "faves" are sublime.

<TEXT> I *love* this episode. May be one of my all time favorites of BM. I'd like to just ask a couple things.

1. Did anybody else know vaguely what was going to happen once the Bioshock reference was made? Deceit from higher authority is a common theme among the series and that just made it click that it was still fake.

2. Did anybody else get MASSIVE Resident Evil vibes from the mansion?

3. Did the end remind anybody else of the end to Jacob's Ladder? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Originally released in early lyrical form in Neil's book, Traveling Music, this song is about his life and the experiences he's had.

___

Factory town = Where he grew up OR (possibly) Cleveland

Close to the edge = Yes album

English winter = England (wrote FBN about this trip)

Moving picture = Moving Pictures (obviously I think)

Razor's edge = possible reference to The Pass?

African village = his motorcycle trip across Africa (wrote Masked Rider book about this and I believe Mystic Rhythms as well)


___
The early lyrics being put in a book about the music throughout his life (more than worth a read by the way, my favorite book of his and I may read it again...) I feel like this is the implication throughout the song. I'd love to know if I missed anything!

<TEXT> I adored the album upon release and still enjoy it, but I have to completely agree with most of what you say. It's annoying to hear about disliking it making you only a fan of one side of DT, whiny, etc. Do people completely overlook the multiple vocal glitches throughout the album and the fact that they sacrificed multiple minutes of a guitar solo for Nomac songs?! It's just kind of sad to know that there was so much more that could have been. They really could have done better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First off, it is NOT obscure, it's one of the most iconic scenes in gaming.

Second, it's too much of a stretch. Jacobs Ladder and Source Code are two movies that come to mind that start on trains. That's like saying a movie is referencing The Last Of Us because it starts with a driving scene and zombies. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So the listen through has had a hell of a run, but with my increased school work load as well as more personal difficulties, I am not going to be able to continue. So what I ask is that if you are interested you let me know and PM me an example of one of your posts.

The other thing, and most important, that I wanted to say is that we are going to be accepting moderator applications for the Subreddit's CSS. You won't have full moderator privileges, but there have been numerous requests to update the look of the sub and, after some convincing, Antidote told me I can go ahead with this post. Below this is a form I'd like you to fill out and PM to me along with a page that shows your ability.

Submissions will close next Friday at 12PM EST and the new moderators/new listen through leader will be announced the next day.

 Cheers!

Those two are my favorite Green Day albums (21CB because it was my first) and they are very similar thanks to the motifs featured throughout the album cause...y'know...rock opera.

<TEXT> Well I'm still young so my view may be swayed by that, but I don't think I could properly be a father as I have my own issues that I struggle with. Bringing in another human being that I have to care for would be bad for everyone involved. I wouldn't want to have a child out of obligation and then not be able to properly care for them, that doesn't make sense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I've had a busy week, but I have a few hours free tomorrow and had some time in between classes today to plan.

I have the final tracklist chosen for disc 2 and also what parts are studio/musical. I'm going to be busy from 4:30 to, like 10 tonight so I have no time to get it done tonight, *however*, I have all the time until 5pm tomorrow. Thanks to this I'll be able to edit, put it in a video, and upload it to YouTube.

I'm so sorry for the delays, but I want to be sure I can put the proper effort into this project so I can look back and say that I was proud of it. I didn't expect a bored day project to and up like this, thank you guys so much! </TEXT>

I love The Who, I love this song.

[Rush's cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILbDCAcnRF4)

Pretty good, but a bit empty in range. It's energetic and fun like everything else on this album.

<TEXT> #***UPDATE:***

**So there's an issue with clyp.it and them...um...kinda not allowing this to be up. However, when I have time to edit the second disc (most likely by the end of this week) I will have a way so you guys can listen to it! Honestly, after being swamped with hours of homework I just want a mental break, so when I have free time I will happily make part 2. Thank you so much for your positive feedback! I'm glad it's being enjoyed how I hoped!**

So tonight I spend ~2-3 hours recutting the first part and have got it done finally. I'm *really* proud of this edit and think, personally, it floors the original edit. Thank you all so much for your constructive criticism and I hope you enjoy this second cut! The second disc should be up ~~tomorrow evening.~~ by the end of the week.

[Link to disc one](https://clyp.it/02pki1hk)

[Link to disc two](coming by the end of the week)

 I'm sorry I didn't take the time to feel the way I do.

This leads to Missing You where he's been trying to move on but succumbs to the fact that he needs her, leading to Wake Me Up and Homecoming where he is finally over her. However, the theme of lying to himself returns in Whatsername where it shows that he's *still* thinking about her. </TEXT>

<TITLE> American Idiot Extended </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-17 22:07:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> #***ANOTHER UPDATE: Because of the positive reaction, I decided to make a second edit. I should have at least part one up tonight which I'm already far more happy with than this edit. I'm pumped for you guys to hear it!***

Out of depression I decided to do a project to make an extended fan cut of American Idiot to hopefully give the album new life for me and so I could combine the actual album with songs I enjoyed from the musical as well as a couple from 21st Century Breakdown. I also made some additions for motifs that I enjoyed in the musical. The tracklist is as follows:

[online stream for disc 1](https://clyp.it/lgvqkrha)

[online stream for disc 2](https://clyp.it/ooxikwao)

Act 1:

1. Intro (The End by The Doors)
2. American Idiot
3. Jesus Of Suburbia
4. Holiday
5. Boulivard Of Broken Dreams (w/ musical end)
6. Restless Heart Syndrome
7. Favorite Son (w/ musical end)
8. Are We The Waiting (w/ musical end)
9. St Jimmy (w/ Minority ending)
10. Give Me Novicaine
11. She's A Rebel
12. The Last Night On Earth (musical version)

Act 2:

13. Before The Labotomy (musical version)	
14. Extrordinary Girl
15. Too Much Too Soon (musical version)
16. 21 Guns (musical version)
17. Letterbomb
18. When It's Time
19. Missing You
20. Wake Me Up When September Ends
21. Homecoming
22. Whatsername (musical version)

Mods, what would your stance be on me uploading this? There are two seperate files for it, one for each act, and it's 320kbps. 

Edit: I should mention that The End is at the start because I enjoy the bookend with the sustained D minor.

Edit 2: uploading to clyp.it now. It's not the greatest thing ever, was whipped up in a day, and I'll probably make another version of it, but I'm still pretty proud of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is my favorite song on the album hands down.

[The Yardbirds version](https://youtu.be/pM1qZBFiOLU)

I think this song is great, but doesn't quite stand the test of time.

[Rush's cover](https://youtu.be/g5F6XgGHeuY)

This song is heavy, but stays true to the classic. I wish they had the "Woooah ooh ooh oohooh" but it's definitely superior in my eyes unlike some other songs here. </TEXT>

[The original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZZD8ckwLJA)

A classic blues song, really great.

[The Who's cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQpiv2vNmV8)

This is what Rush covered, and I adore this version cause I adore The Who. We'll get back to them soon.

[Rush's cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_MrtGW5svo)

Just awesome. So full of energy, makes you want to get up and dance. One thing I dislike is the removal of the voices replying but we got some awesome fills there so it's cool. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree about the snorefest, but that's a fait perspective to have on this NMB album. This does sound very different from TA's Overture in that it's ***extremely*** reminiscent of old DT.

Part of my excitement for this album is that I don't know what to expect. As of now, I'm envisioning a classic DT album with a bit of Spock's Beard's lightness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is this a Genesis reference I spot?! The first two stanzas are extremely reminiscent of the lyrics to the song "It." by Genesis.

Over all, this may be my favorite VT song or definitely one of them.

Sorry for the lack of posts. I've been having a rough time and am currently working on getting it sorted out. I'm not stopping at all in fact I'll be making an effort to not skip weekends now. We'll see how this goes.

<TEXT> I. Absolutely. *Love* this song. It may be my favorite on Vapor Trails in all. The meaning, the music, the feel, everything is wonderful.

___

**Geddy:**

 "Nocturne was one of the later songs that we wrote for the record after the break that we had. There was a group of about 5 or 6 songs that came from a two week period of just what I would consider the best jams Alex and I have ever had. I really love this song, I love the drum pattern, especially the way it starts. Its kind of about the questions you can subconsciously answer in your dreams without realizing it."

<TEXT> It fades into Train Of Thought.

SFAM ends on static and SDoIT starts with static. SDoIT ends on the oscillating note, ToT starts on it. And finally, 8V starts with the low F(?) that ToT ends with before doing a synth sound on the same note. The song Octavarium ends this way too so it ends where it begins </TEXT>

<TITLE> LISTEN THROUGH - Earthshine </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-23 16:31:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This song is pretty cool. I like the playing with time signatures in the chorus. I think it's 10/8, which is wonderful. They were definitely still prog despite what I've heard some people say. This song is really not underrated, it's considered one of the best off VT from what I've heard, but honestly I'm not a huge fan of it. It's good, but bland compared to Ghost Rider, Secret Touch, or Out Of The Cradle.

___
**Meaning of Earthshine:**

 Earthshine, an astronomic phenomena first described by Leonardo Da Vinci in the Codex Leicester between 1506 and 1510, is the term describing the sunlight which is reflected by the Earth to illuminate the Moon. This happens every 29.5 Earth-days, hence the lyric "on certain nights, when the angles are right..."

___

***Geddy:*** Earthshine was just not right in its original incarnation. The lyrics were very interesting, and very evocative, but I didn't feel in the end-and Alex agreed-that the music really equaled what was there lyrically. We were selling the lyrics short. So we had this jam music that we really were excited about, especially this riff, this main riff, that is the verses for Earthshine, and I rebuilt the song vocally around that riff. Then we proceed to just carry on with it, and before we knew it we had a whole knew song that was really exciting.

***Alex:*** Earthshine was the first song that we wrote. At the time we both felt that we weren't going to be too precious about it, it was part of that early period that we went through with the writing, about 5 months into the project I guess? Six months? We reviewed the song and decided to completely rewrite it. There were some lyrical changes, but 100% of the music was thrown into the garbage, and we started over again with it. Which was really a testament to working this way without a deadline, and how important it was not to have a deadline with this record.

<TEXT> This song is really awesome, not much else to say!

___
 In Neil Peart's bookGhost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road, he wrote that his brother Danny read the poem Funeral Blues (W. H. Auden) at his daughter Selenas funeral, the poem contains the lines "The stars are not wanted now: put out every one; Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun; Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood, For nothing now can ever come to any good." This inspired the lines in this song "All the stars fade from the night The oceans drain away." ^^[Source](http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=3796)

<TEXT> Okay, so this has been a long time delayed, but it's finally here! I'm gonna go through the TWRP discography a song a day so we get a little discussion about each and every one in and can easily swap opinions and maybe find new favorites!

This is a great intro to TWRP as a whole. It gives a wonderful preview into what this album is going to be and eases you in perfectly. It's just a snippet, but it's a damn good snippet.

<TEXT> The reason I was given was that I wasn't "mature" enough, couldn't pitch in for shipping for giveaways, etc. But the real reason (I think) is that I wasn't really active there.

I'd browse the modqueue often, make sure people were following the rules, but the head mod was pretty much doing the job I did. About the time she went off on me in our old private mod chat for not pulling my weight (she wasn't really giving me or the other mod a chance to) and subsequently opened up the mod applications I realized I was pretty much gone. We hit 1,000 soon after, but I felt like I was being a bit left out of discussions and knew 98% that I was going to be booted so I didn't bother with the listen through like we planned.

Admittedly, I should have put more effort in on that sub. Even though I was being removed soon I should have done the listen through anyway. Hell, I may still do it! But I was a little bitter at it happening, a bit hurt with the secretive and sudden fashion it was done, and the fact that I wasn't warned at all so I made some poor decisions. None of this is in bad blood. I respect the mods there, they did what they had to for whatever reason they did. I wish them the best of luck and wished that I had done things differently but hindsight is 20/20. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This song went unnoticed for waaay too long. Personally, it may even be my favorite on VT as a whole. The excitement and energy presented in the verse paired with the mellowness and optimism of the chorus.

rushvault.com had a wonderful summary of the meaning of the song:

 There are days, no matter who you are or how well your life is going, that youre a little down. Its an existential trap that even the best of us are subject to once in a while. Maybe the weather even has something to do with it. Some cloudy days are more than just a weather event; theyre a reflection of how we get down in the dumps. On these days, were suspended between how it is and how it ought to be. Its just a part of the human condition. But, importantly, its just a moment in a persons life. Eventually, well move on, and things will go well, and theyll also go bad, but theyll move on, up and down. Then, at some point, well once again be suspended between how it is and how it ought to be. ^^[source](https://rushvault.com/2011/02/16/how-it-is/)

As someone who deals with depression, this song reminds me that life isn't all sadness. There will always be good days, and there will always be sad. Life requires both and if you have both, you know you're doing *something* right.

It doesn't mention that, I dunno, do this exact same thing. I have multiple history books from things as far as memoirs from a prisoner of a French penal camp in (I think) WW1 (it never says), to the memoirs of WW2 veterans, to a book on Nazi experiments, to even something different like the Bath Massacre.

Or how about that I've been playing bass roughly 2 hours a day straight on average for a bit over a year and a half now?

Or how about that I've made a point to take at least one walk/bike ride a day?!

But do I love to learn, I love to do stuff other than watch TV. And what the fuck do you care anyway? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this is one of the songs that will divide us between great and bad. Being maybe a little bit *too* open and loving, I think this is a great song, but I'd love to hear your thoughts!

___

 This is based on a 1935 novel of the same name by A. J. Cronin, which was also made into a film in 1939. The book tells of an English mining town pre-WWI following families and their trials and triumphs, particularly a young man who is a miner and tries to change the conditions for which miners work, but in the end looses his battle for change in parliament and also his wife. He gained nothing and returned to be a miner.

 Neil Peart had lost his wife to cancer and penned this song about his experience. In theVapor Trailstour book, he wrote: "This seemed to express a fitting view of an uncaring universe."

<TEXT> This is about terrorism and the forces of destructive people against those that long for a a time of peace. Specifically, it's a response to the attacks by terrorist on September 11, 2001 against the United States. It also refers to the response of hate against hate and the hope that those who desire peace can have a positive effect on others ^^[source](http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=3412)

It used to be an instrumental prior to the terrorist attacks on 9/11. Do you think it would have been better that way or not?

<TEXT> Yeah. As a bass player you either need to improv on boring songs or shut up about how bored you are.

On boring songs I tend to listen to the drums for energy which is, as I've recently learned, a method that Flea uses. It can make dull parts 10x as fun </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is the first song on VT that I heard. It's really, *really* good.

___
This is a song based on the chronicles of Neil Peart's adventures on a motorcycle journey documented in his bookGhost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road. Peart, who is the bands drummer and lyricist, set out on a 14-month, 55,000 mile motorcycle journey around America after losing his 19-year-old daughter in an auto accident in August 1997, and his wife to cancer just 10 months later.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I thought, because I've been really busy these past two days, I could maybe make it up by doing a cool project.

The idea is that we all add a few non-Rush songs to a [collaborative Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/gamesinabit/playlist/2EQwGXPVAvzOWlvVai9kJO) so we can all get an idea for each other's musical tastes. I've got it started with two of my favorite songs right now and I can't wait to see the variety we get in here!

I also wanted to say thank you so much for sticking with me through inconsistencies. I've been going through some personal shit and have finally started feeling better and will put in a lot more effort to do both the listen through as well as cool stuff like this.

Cheers! ~ </TEXT>

<TITLE> LISTEN THROUGH - One Little Victory </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-09 19:53:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Neil:**

 "I'd been working on that tune and came up with that double bass part. I thought it worked perfectly for the end of the song. But Geddy said, 'That's a great part. You ought to open the song with it. That would just kill.' Frankly, I wouldn't have done it that way-I don't think I would have been so assertive-but Geddy suggested it and I said, 'Okay, I'll try it.'"

**Geddy:**

 "One Little Victory was kind of a triumphant song for us, in the lyrics and the message that the song is about. There was something about that song that seemed just so darned appropriate for opening the record, and also being the first release for us in such a long time. That song started as a collection of jams that Alex had done late at night, just a collection of guitar riffs all linked together in a really kind of a typically-Alex-nonsensical way. I came in the next day after he'd done these things, and just kind of scratched my head but really liked a lot of it. At the same time, there were some lyrics there that Neil had written, which were one of the few lyrics that immediately I just loved, I didn't want to touch a word, it was all great. And so I played with it for a couple of days, started using the digital equipment to manipulate the riffs and add my bass to it, and start writing some vocal melodies. And before I know it I had a song, or what seemed like a song. And then I ran it by Mr. Lerxst here, and he seemed to really dig it. So that kind of became a song and it didn't change much after that."

<TEXT> I just got back from a vacation (hence the missing Listen Throughs during the week) and was thinking, it's been a while since I made a thread asking for your input on the job that /u/Antidote and I do in modding and if there's anything we could do to maybe help out in the community more. We're starting Vapor Trails tomorrow and I'm pumped to see what everybody thinks of it. In case it's gone unnoticed, the schedule for the listen through is simply monday-friday with the weekend being a short break unless something came up in my week.

You guys rule and I couldn't ask for a better community. Seriously, it makes the job of modding 100% easier as well as gives me the joy of reading awesome people talk about Rush and consider it "doing some work". </TEXT>

<TEXT> Idk about you, but I get some hardcore chill vibes from every song on HYF:

Force Ten
 We can move a savage grace in the rhythm of the night...

Time Stand Still
 Summers growing fast, nights growing colder...

Open Secrets
 I guess we all have the feelings...

Second Nature
 It aught to be second nature...

Prime Mover
 The bass soloish thing+the optimism in the chorus+everything about this song

Lock And Key
 We don't wanna be victims, on that we all agree...

Mission
 It's cold comfort for the ones without it...

Turn The Page
 Dat intro

Tai Shan
 The outro with everything at 100% and the clever use of a sample from Time Stand Still

High Water
 The water takes me home... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well first off, Ged straight up said that they have demos. The first evidence of these, that I can remember, is Moving Pictures. It was posted not long ago here actually. We have one album's demos already (Power Windows) and him saying this makes me think that we may get demos. This is also brought up by the head of the company that now owns Rush's catalog saying that he's excited to get stuff out that they haven't been able to before.

Second, Al saying, "And thats why well know when were done." Just going to leave it at that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have one about Rush, specifically Alex Lifeson (the guitarist). Back before their debut album, I think sometime in 71-73, they used to play a venue that would get pretty violent and rowdy at least once a show. At this specific date, Lifeson had just got his tonsils(?) removed thus was stoned on pain killers. It still hurt though, so one of the other guys suggested that they get a little...uh...*soup* to ease the pain.

So there was a Rush show where Al was sitting in a chair, with gnaws, stoned out of his mind on pain killers and weed while watching numerous fights break out as they were extra rowdy that night.

Bonus fact: one of the songs they played that night was an early single of theirs called "You Can't Fight It".

I forgot I had it on my phone and, I think it was Guardian that started playing, that made me think I had some new Dream Theater or a prog band I forgot for the first 40ish seconds. Put jabs to Tate like the line in the chorus of one song, "[R]Evolution calling" and all of the title track sounding like Suite Sister Mary. It's great and I'm excited for what's next. </TEXT>

If it was played that'd be awesome, but I've done extensive research into it and have found that they most likely didn't play it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well this song...this song. I love this song. People diss the cheesiness of the lyrics, but they need to understand that the entire album is cheesier than a slice of provolone. But that doesn't stop it from tasting great when put to this music (or on an italian herbs and cheese bun). They all blend so perfectly, it'd just feel wrong to hate it.

That said, this song is a classic that I wished they did live. It's a very unique Rush song, so cool. The acoustic guitar is a beautiful touch and the lyrics, be a bit cheesy, are the flavoring on top of an already rad song.

<TEXT> I'm a new Coheed fan, but I love these guys. I saw them at Royal Oak in January and am likely seeing then in Grand Rapids this fall. I think the music is astonishing and some of the smartest song writing I've heard, the prime examples being the Prog classic that is 21:13 and, my personal favorite, the slight dissonance in The Velourium Camper II. But I digress.

I know their discography is all part of a story, but is there a site that tells the story song by song? Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Happy post-America day, guys! Today we get to finish our run through Counterparts. This song, I feel, is very underrated and often forgotten. I think that if it had been on Test For Echo it'd get more attention, but being on an album with Animate, Cut To The Chase, Nobody's Hero, among others, hurt it.

<TEXT> OH MY GOD. Okay, I absolutely adore this song. The lyrics are amazing, the bass line is rocking, the melodies are haunting, the everything is so amazing. It's like...oh my god. How about that solo? Or the drum work? The bluesy, almost countryish, feel to the rhythms and chords. I so wished they played this on R40! Honestly, I may put it on my top 10 Rush song list.

Not to mention its use in the Clockwork Angels universe as an unlimited energy source. So awesome.

Anyway, this song kicks SO MUCH ass! It's one of my all time favorite songs to play on bass and always so much fun to jam to. The ending is especially great where there's room to improvise. But let's not ignore the drumming! He's going absolutely psycho on this track, I love it. Probably one of the coolest ones on this album.

<TEXT> I really don't think this song is anything special. It's very clearly a throwback to The Who and, while it's good, it just doesn't feel like anything special. It would be better placed in Vapor Trails or Snakes And Arrows, two more bluesy albums, but here it seems to just get masked by everything else on CP.

That said, it's a good song and would be a blast to see live.

<TEXT> Welp I've already fucked the listen through up but I hope I can be forgiven.

This is a wonderful song and was the first I heard on Counterparts. Its theme is very heavy hitting and philosophical. What *is* a hero? Is it the woman battling cancer, the lifeguard saving lives, or the model on tv that gives young women a positive outlook on life? Or is it all of them?

I feel like this song is extremely relevant with what happened recently in Orlando.

 It's a depressing yet awesome song with an unsettling yet great video too.

<TEXT> Like the person 2 days ago, I'm new to Opeth. I've heard The Human Equation and Pale Communion and that's given me a hint at the proggy instrumentation, the vocals, and the screaming. Here's what I'm listening to so far:

* Black Waterpark
* Damnation
* Heritage

If I'm not huge on screaming but am using Opeth to get there. Are these three good starting points? My favorite bands are Rush, Genesis, Dream Theater, Gentle Giant, Yes, all the prog classics

Edit: 2 songs into Black Waterpark, it's super fucking good, already one of my new favorite bands </TEXT>

This is a decent song, but a bit similar to Cut To The Chase. I used to mix the two up and still do sometimes but more rarely. Honestly, it's one that changes from good to eh depending on the day. The music itself isn't super varied or catchy, not much to see here.

I went to do the links and realised that I was thinking of Cut To The Chase when I was praising this song so I fixed that.

Recently I got Downpour and it feels so much like Silent Hill 2. The horror aspect is very similar and one that we haven't seen in a while from this series. The heavy focus on melee weapons reminded me of 2, the enemies, the very minimal appearances of the Big Bad, and the lore building all remind me of aspects of SH2. Am I wrong about this?

This will be a quick post as I'm at a coffee shop about to work on a review, so I'll just say I love this song. It's great to sing, air drum, and play bass to. That sexy flamenco style is so in your face, I love it! This song also follows my belief in the anima and animus, or the feminine part of a man and masculine part of a woman.

 Just another winner, pours his life down the drain. Just another island in a hurricane. Just another loser, like a cat in the rain. Just another day, ace up in the path of a speeding train.

___
Yet another bright happy sounding song with a kind of depressing meaning. You live your life how you want (that's how I interpreted it at least). The synthesized voice reads contradictory terms, my favorites being:

 Hindu muslim catholic creation / evolutionist

All of those religions based on a story and faith and one based on a scientific theory

 Minimal expressionist post-modern neo-symbolist

Those who are emotionally closed and those who are the exact opposite

 Arm chair rocket scientist graffiti existentialist

The logical and the emotional

 Deconstruction primitive performance photo realist

Those who destroy and those who create

...

You get it.

Pretty much you live your life on the one side that you choose and you're putting the entire course of your life on the line.

___
**Cut To The Chase**

I love the light synths in the background, the guitar part on the verse is classic and catchy, the bass is simple but fun, and the vocals are sassy. The drums don't much stand out on this track. It almost feels like a song off of Power Windows if it were lightened up about 70%.

 Aside from prepping the 40th anniversary deluxe edition of 2112 and a documentary of Rush's R40 tour that is looking to be released in 2016's fourth quarter, Curran is pouring over the catalogue to prep long-unavailable titles for reissue, digitally, on CD and on vinyl...

Possibly meaning live stuff getting a re-release among other things?

***Strong chance of new music:***

 "If I was a gambling man, I would say those guys are going to record some more music," Curran says. "The live component is certainly a question mark with Neil, but they're still quite young at heart. I don't see those guys sitting still for too long and we'll be working with them in the future."

<TITLE> LISTEN THROUGH - Neurotica </TITLE>

<TEXT> **The Words Of The Profits**

 Fortune is random, fate shoots from the hip. know you get crazy, but try not to lose your grip. Life is a diamond you turn into dust looking for trust, and I know that you just don't get it.

**Lessons**

Neurotic: "often or always fearful or worried about something." [(Source)](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/neurotic)

-Ica (suffix): "acollectionof things that relate to a specific place, person, theme, etc." Also commonly used as a feminine form. [(Source)](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/-ica)

Erotica: "literature or art intended to arouse sexual desire." (Source is just Google)

Thus I think Neurotica is about...I really don't know. Maybe women being constantly anxious of men? That's all I can think of.

**Cut To The Chase**

It's just a fun song with kind of goofy lyrics, cool instrumentation, and just a fun feel overall. Definitely an overall favorite!

<TEXT> **From The Pages Of History**

 I don't believe in destiny or the guiding hands of fate. I don't believe in forever or love as a mystical state. I don't believe in the stars, or the planets, or angels watching from above. But I believe there's a ghost of a chance we can find someone to love and make it last.

**Cut To The Chase**

If you don't like this song I don't know if we can be friends. This is hands down the best song on the album (in my opinion). The melodies are so calming, the synths are in the background but still very present. The guitar solo is absolutely classic and the way the song flows is absolute perfection.

Lyrically, I think this song is up there with the best work he's done ever including Freewill, Hemispheres, Limelight, among others. It once again is a cliche meaning (love) that is tackled in a unique fashion that doesn't glorify love but also doesn't shame or deny it. This is a prime example that his writing is just as good as before.

The live performances are also really awesome. ~~It's a shame they didn't do any after the RTB tour.~~ I wish they played it at R40, the one show I saw.

<TEXT> Now that they've announced a South American leg, what do you think will follow this. I think that they'll do a reverse Metropolis 2000 and will do a regular tour after this with few Astonishing songs. I'm sure they won't do a round 2 tour as, though it was an amazing show, it's too controlled and feels like watching a movie.

What I'd love is a Neverender type tour from them. A Neverender tour is a thing that Coheed And Cambria does where they play an album in full. My personal pick would be Octavarium because listening to the album in full is awesome enough, imagine a live version! </TEXT>

Pretty much, I love this song. It's really relaxed and, while the anti-war meaning is quite cliche, Neil nails it in a pretty unique way, but not as unique as tomorrow! The chorus is really awesome and beautiful.

<TEXT> I used to hate this song, but I'm not sure why. The intro is really cool, the verse isn't any cheesier than the rest of the album. The chorus's vocal line has almost a country type feel to it but is super catchy. The guitar part is great and so is the drum part. The bass is very average but the synths make up for that. It's really just an awesome song even if it is kind of odd.

The bridge reminds me of the little xylophone+bass break down in Marathon slowed down.

<TEXT> I think this is a good song, but it really doesn't live up to the pure awesomeness of the classic Gangster Of Boats Trilogy. It's very catchy, but is a bit *too* repetitive.

But looking at this seriously, what would the other 3 parts be? Personally, this is what I think is best fitting:

1. Limbo
2. Leave That Thing Alone
3. The Main Monkey Business
4. Where's My Thing?/There It Is

Edit:

Every inch in this album is packed with what seems to be a million metaphors, references, and meanings. It's truly a masterpiece and probably one of the most complex stories of the last 100 years.

Such a shame that they didn't play it live as I can totally imagine a huge fireworks pop at the transition to the chorus and a lot of cool light and pyrotechnic work. Would've fit beautifully in the Clockwork Angels tour with the strings, but I digress.

<TEXT> I'm really pumped for this section! This album is stupid underrated and it's recently become one of my favorites!

This song sounds like it'd be great live which is a huge part of this album. Presto feels like it's only intended for the album while this album feels like the songs were pretty much crafted to be done live. This is no exclusion

The bass has a very unique and interesting part and that guitar solo is classic!

The meaning is very true and beautifully written.

 We're only immortal for a limited time.

I view it as Anthem Part 2. Live the life you want to live, go as far and do as much as you can.

<TITLE> Games with similarities to these 5 games? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-28 02:30:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> These are my top 5 games of all time:

1. Dark Souls 2 - I like the exploration, secrets, and difficulty in this. It's hard, but not impossible. With enough determination you can definitely do it. The combat is a bit clunky, but the variety of attacks and the rolling helps make up for it. The lack of forgiveness is amazing and is something that's been seldom explored since the original Zelda on NES.

2. Silent Hill 2 - I play this game purely for the puzzles and story. Everything about those two aspects is phenomenal. Is anybody here familiar with The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway, the album by Genesis? If so, this is the game version of that. Atmospheric with loads of plot and symbolism for people to explore for years to come. Plus the challenging puzzles are loads of fun.

3. Wind Waker - I love the large open world with so many places to explore plus the combat is fantastic! The plot isn't too much to talk about, but it does have a nice spin to make it more believable rather than "save the princess you just met". The puzzles are fun, the characters are very entertaining, and the art style is beautiful and fills me with joy.

4. Katamari Demacy - Not much to say, it just makes me happy. Cute music, cute graphics, an original idea (if you forget about Snake). It's just fun.

5. Portal - If you haven't caught a trend, I love puzzles and atmosphere. If a game has two of those things then I'm all set to go. Funny characters, an enjoyable plot, and great gameplay is all I need.

Consoles I have are PS2, Xbox 360, Wii, and 3DS.

I've also played Bethesda games as an FYI, so I know those fit right up my alley. Just thought I'd mention that. But I've only played some of Skyrim and Fallout 3, enough to feel content </TEXT>

This song is my favorite on Presto hands down. The only thing that brings it down is its not full. This is what prevents Presto from being a top 5 album in my eyes. It's just too flat.

But flatness doesn't bother me in this song because every second is perfect! I'm excited to hear everyone's opinions on this.

<TEXT> I love love love this song! It reminds me of summer because I listened to it constantly then. This would've fit perfectly on R40 but whatever. It's just a beautiful song.

Don't ask me, I'm just improvising.

<TEXT> This is an alright song. I like the synth bass line. It reminds me a bit of Red Lenses honestly, but it's nowhere near as good. I used to love this but now I think it's one of the weakest on Presto.

<TITLE> My family got a cat off the streets and into our home. It was going great, but she's been bullying one of our others, please help! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-17 22:57:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We have three cats. Emmy, Luna, and Faythe (the newest). Emmy we rescued from a very bad household, Luna we fostered and then got, and Faythe who we adopted. Faythe was a neighborhood cat and she immediately clung to me. Originally we were only going to take her in for the winter, but she got very attached to me and vice versa.

Now, she and Luna get along beautifully. They'll play constantly and then lay together sometimes when they aren't. However, Faythe has been attacking Emmy who was declawed by her previous owners. Because of this, she can't defend herself. And Faythe has been attacking her. Maybe it's playing, maybe not, I don't know, but it has Emmy horrified. She lays on one couch, hisses at Luna (they got along beautifully before) and hisses and growls at Faythe. I've ended up having to feed her on the chair. She won't get up to use the litter box so she goes on a couch or chair or, (until she wasn't allowed in it anymore) my parent's room.

My parents have only tried separating them, but that won't work. They say they're at a loss but I don't think they've even tried much of anything! Please, what can I do to make her stop. It may be too late, they already have a friend who may be interested.

She's a sweetheart. She'll curl up in bed with me, purrs like a lawnmower, and is a beautiful cat. Is there anything I can do? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This song is an...it's an interesting little ditty. I listened to this song a lot when I first got into Rush. It's not great, but it's the inspiration I needed to loose weight along with The Pass, Marathon, and others.

The line that stands out to me is obviously "The mirror always lies." I've used it to help friends with self esteem issues as well as to help my own self esteem. It doesn't have the best writing of any Rush song, in fact it isn't as good as 90% of them, but still. It's alright.

The instrumentation isn't much to write home about either.

<TEXT> Oh boy, this song. Seriously, I owe my life to this song. When I was in a super deep depression last year, this song is part of what helped me keep going. I'm sure plenty of people are the same way.

The lyrics are a masterpiece, the instrumentation is beautiful and haunting, and the climax of the song "No hero in your tragedy, no daring in your expense, no salutes to your surrender, nothing noble in your fate. Christ what have you done?" is like a punch in the gut.

Another little thing I love is the sweeping synths. They're so pretty.

<TEXT> Alright, this has been a crazy time! Our list for this update is:

* Subs
* Wiki
* EP

___
***SUBS***

We now have 500 subs! I'm so happy about this. Thank you all so much for joining, it's really fucking rad of all of you. I would like to say, however, we're doing something extra special for 1,000 subs that will

#blow your fucking mind.

So be sure to spread the word of the sub so we can hit that goal and surprise you with that amazingness that's still brewing.

___
***Wiki***

Our glorious mod /u/Condensor worked super hard to make a super rad [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/TWRP/wiki/index) that contains tour dates, discography (all that wasn't lost in the Great Space Laser War of 2011 at least), lyrics, and much much more. Go check it out if you haven't. It kicks ass!

___
***New EP***

I feel it's necessary to tell you that they have an EP coming out on April 23th of 2016 (hey, that's *this year*)! It's called Guardians Of The Zone and contains these songs:

1. Time To Shine
2. Rock N Roll Best Friends
3. Makin' a Move
4. The No Pants Dance (feat. Ninja Sex Party)
5. Business Tips
6. Groove Crusaders

Makin A Move is up on their bandcamp, so check that out too!

___

Once again, thanks so much for subbing. I'm pumped for this upcoming 1000 sub thing, and I'm pumped that we even made it *this far*.

Rock on, /r/TWRP </TEXT>

I love this list so much, great work! Now while I'm getting into mixing, I need to ask for you talented artists on /r/DreamTheater to make the most *kickass* art you can! I'm really looking forward to seeing this part.

I'm gonna admit, I'm becoming a bit nervous with this result. If you guys want, we can redo this in the summer when I have more time to plan. I just don't want to put out something of subpar quality.

As for the mixing, I'm just gonna make it flow. When finished, I'll put up a flac and mp3 version with the album art so both audiophiles and people who are more concerned about storage space can listen.

You've all been doing great work and I'm interested to see how this turns out!

Cheers!

Anyway, The Garden. Wow. A journey from Garden Road to The Garden. I believe this song is a masterpiece. Truly. The strings and just...I can't today.

Instead of linking, let's go through a little best of.

How about the time /u/Arctos889 said that Tai Shan was his favorite song and reached the WORLD RECORD of -999999 downvotes? We broke Reddit with that!

Or how about the Dog Years thread where literally nobody posted? That was funny.

Oh! And when /u/berkmarhighschool made a really intriguing argument about Working Them Angles being about Communism? Classic!

My personal favorite is when /u/KieranX, /u/Mattou, and /u/Hokie23aa came together to try and take down our listen through BUT WE DIDN'T LET THEM, DID WE?

<TEXT> I was looking at the lyrics of "it" when I realized there were 32 descriptions of it. Who helped Rael through the Chamber of **32** doors? Lilywhite Lilth. The song named after her is the twelfth on the album. The twelfth description is "It is the jigsaw".

it is the puzzle.

This makes a bit of sense I think.

* "The puzzle's only knock and knowall (no wall, there's no true answer), but I like it"

* When you eat right through the puzzle (when you explore it, when you find everything there is to find), you'll see everything alive (you'll see pointless details important)

* Any rock can be made to roll if you [spend enough time on the puzzle] 

* "The puzzle is purple haze" Hendrix often gave various answers to the meaning of Purple Haze

And most important:

* The puzzle is both the chicken and the egg

I think that last one means that the puzzle is boh John (the chicken, the mature and developed one) and Rael (the one in the cocoon, waiting for birth). The key to the puzzle isn't it, it's who Rael and John represent. That means it's just Rael. The answer to the puzzle is that John and Rael combined. If you didn't know, John is the good side of Rael, at least that's widely believed. If John and Rael combined that means Rael's good now.

The key to the puzzle is that Rael's journey is over...I think. I'm confused now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh boy. This is on my list of top 10 Rush songs for sure. It's an absolute masterpiece. The lyrics, the little piano hurried in the verse, the proggy bits, the use of clicky synths, the guitar during "on the price of being free" in the chorus and also during "so we keep it under lock and key...lock and key...", it's just. GAH!

This is a great one to bike/run to, and the intro to the live version is great. I wish they did this for R40. This is easily my favorite on the album. It's haunting and just amazing. I seriously cannot express how much I like this.

Also that guitar solo is a classic. This is a song that's easy to airdrum and headbang to and impossible to not.

<TEXT> ...well at least with the podcast. I'm gonna listen to the audio book too, but that's over 10 hours!

I just finished the actual podcast (minus the bonus episodes) and bought every live episode a few minutes ago. Plus I saw them on their murder mystery tour and will see them in a few weeks.

After nearly three years of listening to Night Vale I'm so glad to be caught up again for the first time in over a year! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Experiment: Some songs can be perfectly combined </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-26 18:15:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This started when I realized that Cold Fire was remarkably similar to Red Tide. I combined it, and it worked PERFECTLY. This made me curious, and I brainstormed what other songs sound a like. I came up with this list and decided that I would test them.

1. In The Mood vs. I Think I'm Going Bald - This one went pretty well. It's the same basic chords I think.
2. Bastille Day vs. Headlong Flight
3. Freewill vs. Caravan
4. A Passage To Bangkok vs. BU2B
5. Ghost Rider vs. Secret Touch
6. Scars vs. Seven Cities Of Gold
7. Heresy vs. You Bet Your Life
8. Cinderella Man vs. Wish Them Well
9. Red Tide vs. Cold Fire

I'll test these out and put the results up on Dropbox so we can maybe have a sick combination album!

Do you guys have any other similar songs? </TEXT>

___
* A Change Of Seasons
* The Ytse Jam
* Afterlife
* Metropolis
* Learning To Live
* Space-Dye Vest
* The Mirror
* Trial Of Tears
* Peruvian Skies
* Finally Free
* Home
* The Glass Prison
* Blind Faith
* In The Name Of God
* Vacant+Stream Of Consciousness
* Sacrificed Sons
* Panic Attack
* Ministry Of Lost Souls
* The Dark Eternal Night
* The Shattered Fortress
* The Best Of Times
* Breaking All Illusions
* Bridges In The Sky
* The Enemy Inside
* The Looking Glass
* Three Days
* A New Beginning
* The Path That Divides
* Our New World

___
So, I guess you guys chose these...

Anyway, what we're doing now is the track list challenge. Pretty much, you just organize it how you want and then next Saturday we vote! The only rule is that it'll be 2 "discs".

Have fun! </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's got 16 or so short stories by various authors that are based around Rush songs, including a 2112 follow up by KJA and the stories that inspired Roll The Bones and Red Barchetta.

I for one am pumped for this. I'm just about to finish Clockwork Lives after reading Clockwork Angels very quickly and have preordered both the book and sample booklet that I hope to get soon. However, looking at the comments on some Rush news sites it looks like others don't share my excitement...it looks like nobody else does. Please tell me I'm not alone in this. PLEASE. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What are some more albums/bands for me to check out? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-23 17:54:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Quite a lengthy read coming up, but eh.

Elements I love in progress:

* As a bass player, the Rickenbacker sound greatly pleases me and is always a plus
* Metal and instrumentals, but no strong screaming
* I'm weak for concept albums
* Long songs too
* As long as it doesn't have screaming, I'll probably be able to get into it

I'm a huge fan of Rush, Dream Theater, Genesis, and Pink Floyd. My top two current favorites of theirs are:

Rush: Clockwork Angels and A Farewell To Kings (although Hold Your Fire may be tied for second).

Dream Theater: Systematic Chaos (I've had ITPoE and TDEN on repeat today) and SFAM

Genesis: Selling England By The Pound (specifically The Cinema Show) and The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway (complex story telling is a plus)

Pink Floyd: Meddle (I saw a tribute band on Saturday and they did a fucking AMAZING version of Echoes, I seriously almost cried of sheer joy after it) and Animals.

___
As for other prog, this is what I've been listening to over the past few months:

* Her Halo by Teramaze (lesser known, but fucking amazing)
* Tarkus by ELP (I have it on at this second)
* Thick As A Brick by Jethro Tull (listened to this for the first time last night, fucking great, awesome drumming)
* SF Sorrow by The Pretty Things (I listened to this for the first time today too, and it's absolutely wonderful)
* Tommy by The Who (I've returned to this recently, but I was ***in love*** with this album/movie when I was little)
* The Mountain by Haken (This album is a classic, my favorite song is either Atlas Stone or Cockroach King)
* Every album by Coheed And Cambria (I saw these guys recently and that's what largely started my fandom, Good Apollo is probably my favorite album because of The Willing Well)
* Liquid Tension Experiment by LTE (I love the instrumentals and DT, so this is perfect)
* Lateralis by Tool </TEXT>

If you don't want to read my bullshit and just want to vote, head [here](http://goo.gl/forms/QtRvvLNZme).

Anyway, these results were interesting, disappointing, and slightly predictable. The thing that pissed me off the most is that Outcry wasn't chosen. I love you guys, but come ON! That's an amazing song, and yet more people picked *Sacrificed Sons* over it?

Anyway, coming soon will be the 2 songs from each album that will appear on this subreddit album, and the setlist contest where you can comment the setlist you'd like it to have, and then we'll make a vote for it.

That's going to be from this Friday to next Friday and then I'm on spring break and will have time to mix it while the cover art contest goes on.

<TEXT> It's about time we get this goddamn thing off the ground, don't you think? :)

After the original front-runner of the subreddit album has seemingly abandoned this project, I've decided to take it under my wing. So you guys/girls may be a bit confused. Here's my schedule:

___
3/18: First round of track voting

3/22: Second round of track voting

3/25: Songs announced and tracklist contest begins

4/1: Tracklist is chosen, artwork contest begins, and I begin mixing

4/8: Mixing will be done, the artwork will be **Chosen**, and the album will be released as a zip file onto the subreddit

___
So we've got a little less than a month to go on this. If you feel like I should alter the schedule, please let me know and I'll considre it.

Without further ado, [here's the link to vote!](http://goo.gl/forms/dhmJTafZm8)

Be sure to select only 3 for each album and 1 for the epics question (the first one).

Okay, I'm sorry. This is my favorite song on Power Windows. I first heard it when I was barely getting into Rush. I watched the Clockwork Angels Live DVD and fell in love with this song. On my family's trip to Florida last spring, I had it on repeat along with Manhattan Project. It kind of reminds me of 80s Genesis which was my favorite band when I was little (I'm still only 15, so I'm not old at all). Specifically Land Of Confusion.

<TEXT> Before I start, do you like Daft Punk and indie music? Do you just want to hear something new? If so, come to /r/TWRP where I'm running a second listen through for *their* discography! You won't be sorry!

Anyway, here's another fucking amazing song. What else is there to say? So much fun to sing, and was one of two songs to greatly help me through my recent depression.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Welcome to the first listen through post! We'll be going through an album a day in a similar vain to what I've been doing in /r/Rush. Once this wraps up, I'll do another thing like I did in /r/Rush, which is a daily discussion post where it's something related to either twrp or the community that would for a great discussion.

Today's song is on the first TWRP album known to exist (as discussion on prior releases is prohibited by the FBI on account of it being too fucking amazing), and it starts it off, obviously. It's The Device Prelude! It's a neat little track that, in the style of a prelude, gives a great sneak peak at the album without spoiling the best bits!

___
[The song](https://youtu.be/j5CKFyff4i4)

[A Mario Paint version](https://youtu.be/aLGzI1J6ppY)

___
I'd like to mention, this is my first time listening to their discography as well. I'll be adding any live videos containing the song (this one's live version comes with tomorrows song as they're packaged into one nice bundle).

So what do you think of the prelude to The Device, TWRP, and the listen through? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This song is easily in my top ten Rush songs. I absolutely adore it ever since the first time I heard it while my family was vacationing in Florida. I was praying that this would be played in R40 and was distraught when they just played DEW. Such a bummer, I'd kill to see this live.

<DATE> 2016-03-05 20:27:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> #He's left now. I'll put this up again when I go visit him next month.

**EDIT: I'll be posting answers now**

**EDIT 2: I'm recording his answers and will upload it later tonight. There's some interesting things in this.**

Hey, I'm the Grandson and my grandpa is supposed to be here in a few hours. I've always been amazed at his life story, and thought it would be fun to share it with you and have you guys ask him questions so hopefully we can both learn new things.

Here's a basic rundown of his life:

* His family (not w/ him) moved to the US from what's now Croatia
* Grew up in a depression era Michigan UP mining town
* Was amazing at basketball (still has newspaper clippings)
* His dad died when he was 14(?) and he had to *wake up the postman* to call for an ambulance, walked back when he got no answer and was told "Come back with help or don't come back at all"
* His uncle had a bar (iirc)
* He worked on an iron oar freighter at the age of 18 and was promoted to be some people's boss
* Went to work in the Navy right before WW2 ended
* Met my grandma who was 13 years younger when he was in his 40s(?)
* Moved to Gaylord, MI to work as a teacher and a driver's ed instructor
* While there he had 4 children
* Was moved to a small town in central Michigan to be a superintendent where he lives to this day
* Has 10 grandchildren among those 4 kids (three had two, one had four)
* Is in great health and almost 90
* Has a brother still alive, but who has Alzheimer's

A couple stories:

* Once he took a trip to Las Vegas with someone (I can't remember who), and lost all of his money. He ended up having to call a friend for a loan to pay for gas on the way home. There's way more, but I forgot.

* He went to his first rock concert maybe...ten years ago. He saw Scorpions with my dad and his brother in California. The drummer gave him his stick and then my Grandpa turned to a girl behind him and gave it to her

Today we're actually going to a Croatian festival, so I have an hour and a half long car ride with him, but he isn't coming for another hour. I figured it'd be good to get questions in early so I know if people are interested.

Edit: He'll be here soon, so I hope that more comes. The two so far are great though.

Edit 2: I'm currently in the car with him. I'll start asking questions soon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm doing a personal project, but I need a list of as many Prog Rock tropes as possible. So far I have these:

* Long Songs (7 minutes)
* A solo longer than 1 minute
* Multiple solos in one song
* Tracks that flow into one another
* Instrumental songs
* A concept
* Dissonance
* Sound bites (quotes from TV, movies, etc)
* Sound effects
* Obscure instruments (stuff other than the typical guitar, bass, drums, keyboards, and vocals)
* Odd time signatures
* Changing time signatures
* Key changes
* Polyrhythms
* A Rickenbacker bass
* A Hammond organ
* A singer with a high voice
* An orchestra or brass section
* Heavy use of synthesizers/keyboards
* Complex musical parts
* Different genres within one song
* Vocal harmonies

<TITLE> WEEKLY SUBREDDIT UPDATE #1 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-02 21:28:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So we have a few announcements to make. I'll split it into sections so it's nicer to read.
___
Section list:

1. 100 subs!
2. Rules
3. Flairs
4. Future plans
5. Under The Covers

___
**#1: 100 SUBS!**

I'm so pumped to see that this is getting off the ground! Hopefully we'll get even more as the next two days go by and hopefully also in the following weeks thanks to Under The Covers. But no matter what, thank you all for joining.
___
**#2: Rules**

We've added some rules that *will be enforced.* While moderating is our job, we'll also try to be understanding. I hope that you all know that how you react after getting in trouble (see also: a temporary ban if your offense is bad enough) can effect the length of the ban.

But don't worry, we won't be just tossing around bans. We'll take action as we see is required after some conversation.
___
**#3: Flairs**

Something we're trying to come up with is flairs. /u/TWRPband will be receiving some badass flair, but we want to make sure you guys/gals have something too. Ideas we have so far are the album covers and the masks, but we want your suggestions too! Drop them here in the comments and we'll consider them!
___
**#4: Future plans**

Now, we've got some pretty cool plans for this sub in the future. One that I can't quite tell you about cause it's still up in the air, and another that I can.

The one that I can is that we'll be making a weekly or monthly post every Sunday or the last day of each month depending on which one we end up doing.
___
**#5: Under The Covers**

As you all know, Ninja Sex Party's new album is being released in just *two days*! It will feature TWRP alongside NSP with cover albums. I'm giving you a warning now:

#IF YOU LINK TO A LEAK OR ANY ILLEGAL DOWNLOAD, THE POST WILL BE REMOVED. REPEATED ACTION WILL RESULT IN A TEMPORARY BAN.

Links to *official* YouTube videos will be allowed, but non-official videos featuring just the music and nothing else will be removed. This is where I have to put my foot down. I won't say that I've never got stuff from the open seas, but I don't want it posted here. Unofficial YouTube videos featuring only the audio and cover art is a huge pet peeve of mine. No bans will be issued from this, but I will remove them.
___
Thank you all, once again, for joining!

Obvious ones include Green Day, Panic At The Disco, Coheed and Cambria (my favorite of the obvious category), and Iron Maiden (stated by Gerard as one of his main influences), and a bit of The Misfits. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Next year marks a 15th anniversary of Bullets and this year marks a 10th anniversary of Black Parade. These are arguably two of their most important albums as well as two of their best (in my top 5 for sure). So if they came back and you had to make them a setlist, what would yours look like?

For me it would be:

*Intro: Look Alive, Sunshine*

1. Na Na Na (Na ^8)
2. I'm Not Okay (I Promise)
3. To The End
4. Kiss The Ring
5. Desolation Row
6. I Never Told You What I Do For A Living
7. Sleep
8. House Of Wolves
9. Mama
10. Ambulance
11. Heaven Help Us
12. Early Sunsets Over Monroeville (with Demolition Lovers's intro)
13. Hang Em High
14. Helena
15. The Ghost Of You
16. Interlude/The Jetset Life Is Gonna Kill You

*Tape: Jet-Star And The Kobra Kid/Traffic Report*

17. Party Poison
18. Cubicles
19. Welcome To The Black Parade
20. Disenchanted (with the chorus from Shut Up And Play)
21. Famous Last Words
22. The Kids From Yesterday

Encore:

*Intro tape: Goodnight Dr. Death*

22. Vampire Money
23. Fake Your Death

Encore 2:

24. Blood </TEXT>

<TEXT> So my dad and my uncle managed to get into mcr's second Roxy show and brought back a full length bootleg and a shirt they made specifically for the show. Sadly I've lost the shirt for now (it's probably buried with some laundry in the back room), but I've got some pictures/clips for proof. Does anybody know if there are any other recordings of this in full?

Honestly, I've got some moral issues with sharing as it was a birthday gift from my uncle to me. Also, I don't really know how to rip it onto a computer, I'm not to knowledgeable on stuff like that.

However, I'm willing to answer any questions on it for you guys. I could also transcribe some if the talking sections if you guys are interested in that.

<TEXT> We're back! This is a simple song, but a good one (even if it's my least favorite on the album). I love the organ bit before the chorus and this song has a great solo section. I've heard people say Al's best solos are on P/G and PoW. I 100% agree and think I know why. Due to the synth thing, he wasn't focusing as much on guitar bits for main parts of the song. Rather, he focused strongly on the solos.

<TEXT> This is an amazing song by Dream Theater off of Scenes From A Memory. Kind of Rush meets heavier metal. I recommend that, if you have an hour and a half to spare, you you go listen to the entire album of Metropolis Part 2: SFAM.

It's about a guy who is having these reoccurring dreams with a girl. He falls into an obsession and the album starts with his first visit to a hypnotherapist and tells what he finds. It was vote the best Prog album of all time in a reader poll for Rolling Stone and is my personal favorite album of all time.

<TEXT> Sorry. I was starting to get burnt out on this and, in fear of not making quality posts, decided it'd be best to take a break for a day or two as opposed to letting what happened from about 2112-Moving Pictures happen (where I got burnt out and lazily threw posts together). As a moderator, I like to take pride in the work I do. This is an awesome community and these posts have been a nearly daily occurrence for many months now. I want these to be something I can happily look back on instead of looking in disappointment.

***I'VE DECIDED THAT, IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THIS ENTHUSIASM FOR THE SERIES, I WILL MAKE A POST WITH A DIFFERENT SONG I FEEL EVERYONE SHOULD CHECK OUT EACH DAY FOR ONLY A WEEK. AFTER THAT, IT'S RIGHT BACK TO P/G***

Anyway, this is a great song. The little keyboard section "Do do do, do do do, dodododo do do do, do do do, etc" is one of my favorite bits in any Rush song. It's so happy and resembles someone stunned by this amazing feat of humanity. That's something captured perfectly in this song, an achievement that grips everyone and destroys the barriers separating each individual.

<TEXT> #I EDITED THIS POST BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE CALLING ME UNGRATEFUL WHICH IS UNTRUE. I WANTED TO ELABORATE ON THE FACT THAT I STILL REALLY ENJOYED THE SHOW, BUT WAS CALLED "DISHONEST TRASH" FOR DOING SO. MAN, FUCK THIS FANBASE.

This loving criticism goes out to the ladies in the crowd tonight.

There NOTHING new in it. Here's what the nsp section was

1. The Decision
2. If We Were Gay
3. Everybody Wants To Rule The World
4. Take On Me
5. The Hit

That's it. Aside from the two obvious covers played at both of their Toronto shows and the obvious song they did with TWRP, it's seriously annoying that they haven't added a new NSP song to the set since 2009! I mean really! And the fact that they teased 6969 with "Looks like this is song 69" makes it even worse. I'm sure it was great to be there, and the versions with full instruments were cool, but they wasted an opportunity to use a full band to do literally anything else than their two most played songs.

That said, it was a fucking fantastic show, probably the best I've ever seen them do, and I hope I can one day see then if they come around, not just on Twitch. Seriously, a great performance that I'm sure I'll watch dozens upon dozens of times more. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Such a sad song. I remember playing it one rainy day with my windows open letting in the beating of raindrops. Signals is my summer album and likely many other people's as well. Only 113 more days!

I love the time signatures. 5/8 intro/verse switching to 4/4 at the end of the verse then back to 5/8, then 4/4 again, and 8/8 at the chorusish thing, then 4/4, then 5/8, then my favorite. 11/8 phrased as 6/8, 5/8. Followed by a switch to 6/8 then eventually 5/8 and finally back to 4/4 to close the song. It's probably their most complex since Hemispheres (Cygnus Book 2) and a great showcase of their ability to seamlessly switch between time signatures. Another example is Tom Sawyer where it goes from 4/4 into 7/8 in the solo part counted as 1 2 3 1-11 2 3 .

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I firmly believe that Vital Signs is the best track on Moving Pictures. Also, the 90s was their best era for live shows. They had great energy, they had great set lists, the crowds were amazing, and the sound was as good as it has ever been and will ever be.

And, you guys will hate me, I don't much care for the R40 CD. The mix is better than the Clockwork one (which we all agree is absolute shit) but I still find myself going back to ATWAS, ESL, GUPL, ASOH, DS, and R30 far more than R40.

It's just because they have literally anything you could want except for Losing It and some stuff off Snakes And Arrows and Clockwork Angels.

And I know a lot of people like ATWAS over ESL because it's more genuinely live, but I prefer ESL's setlist and, honestly, the mixing isn't *that* horrid. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NOTE: To the person who reported this for being illegal or immoral, it is neither to be honest. According to Standord's website, this is fair use. It's an alteration on the original material. Literally a remix. Plus, I'm not selling it and I'm not claiming it as my own. Also, it's pretty fair to say most people (99%) who care about this in the first place have Vapor Trails in some form already.

I found this while looking for stuff on torrent sites (I've already legally purchased all the media I can, don't worry). It's the BEST remix of Vapor Trails I've ever heard. [Here is a link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8vgse7e1y7a6t7h/AACJaeqzrz_B-Zn8iYxKcScna?dl=0) to a Dropbox folder with all of the songs. Check it out, seriously it's great. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For simplicity, I have all of SFAM combined into their proper scenes with some liberties.
Pretty much it's this:

1. Regression/Overture 1928/Strange Deja Vu
2. Through My Words/Fatal Tragedy (I know Deja Vu transitions into Words, but I can live with one iffy one)
3. Beyond This Life/Through Her Eyes
4. Home/The Dance Of Eternity
5. One Last Time/The Spirit Carries On/Finally Free (this makes a fucking awesome epic)

I also have Metropolis at the start of SFAM and A Change Of Seasons at the end of Images And Words.

Don't kill me please.

EDIT:

Oh, also, I got rid of that stupid crying in Losing Faythe and combined the tracks that fade into each other on that album. But I hate the crying there. Absolutely ridiculous. Also, I got rid of Astonishing and am interrupting the ending as "she died and went to heaven". No Disney-bullshit ending. She's dead. The end. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've got a likely controversial opinion on this song: I firmly believe it has the most difficult bass part of any Rush song. EVER. This is coming from someone who can play YYZ with about 90% accuracy. This bass part is complicated, fast, and brilliant. The guitar solo's pretty damn awesome as well. A theory I have about why Lerxst's best solos happen to be in the synth era is because he didn't have much other say for the guitar part. So his time to shine would always be in the solos. Maybe that's just me.

<TEXT> If you have anything cool/rare, please post it in the **comments** and I'll add it!

I've compiled this list of cool/rare Rush stuff including unreleased songs, collaborations, soundchecks, and bootlegs. You more intense fans may have seen all of these, but hopefully you'll find something new. I've seen 99% of these multiple times, but by far the coolest thing is way at the bottom. I found a complete soundcheck from R40 with SOUNDBOARD AUDIO. Had no clue that existed! So enjoy!

Edit: I'll do more organization and add more in a bit. My phone's about to die.

It's not like I don't do anything. I write constantly, read daily, and listen to and make music, but for the life of me I can't bring myself to do homework. It's so boring and time wasting that I seriously can't help doing stuff that's more interesting and fulfilling.

<DATE> 2016-02-13 20:03:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So right now we're kind of in a limbo as fans. We don't know if we're getting a new Rush album or not. When asked if Rush is in Limbo, Geddy responded:

*"No, I don't think 'limbo' is the right way to describe it. I can't speak for them - in fact, I'm certainly not speaking for them, just for me - but I found the end of the tour to be a very sad time. I was melancholy for quite a while because I felt it was... truncated. I'm not saying that my partners weren't justified in their decision - I'm not criticising their decision in any way. I'm just describing my feeling. And I wasn't ready to end the tour. And the thought that it might have been our last one really hit me pretty hard. So it took me a while to get past that point. And I am past that point, and now I'm trying to think about what the future might bring for me. I'm trying to be more optimistic about it. And I have gotten drunk with Al a couple of times, and Al is... well, he's Al. If I call him, he's there."* [(Source)](http://cygnus-x1.net/links/rush/prog-02.2016.php)

That's comforting. But let's go back all the way to R40. Well, two years *prior* to R40. In an online article for Rolling Stone in 2013, Geddy was asked about a 40th anniversary tour. This is what he said:

*"I think [2015 will be the earliest for something new]. Something like that. . . The plan now is to have no plans. We have had a great 10 years of tour, album, tour album. I can honestly say that the three of us enjoyed this tour more than any one we've ever done. We left on a high note, but we recognize that we need to pay attention to our families and recharge our batteries. So we decided that we're just not going to discuss anything for a little while."* [(Source)](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/q-a-rushs-geddy-lee-on-finally-taking-a-break-from-the-road-20130923)

So they didn't shut down anything, but they didn't say yes either. It's comforting to know that they can spin it around so quickly. And much like in this article, both Al and Ged seem eager to continue for another album.

Now flash forward to the R40 tour announcement. In a press conference early 2015, the band said this:

*"These not-to-be-missed concerts will highlight four decades of the bands music, [this] will most likely be their last major tour of this magnitude."* [(Source)](http://ultimateclassicrock.com/rush-last-major-tour/)

That has been since confirmed in numerous interviews. So everything seemed bleak, when this article appears!

*"That question was posed many times: Is this is? Is this the end? I don't think it is the end, and we never really said this is definitively our last tour. I think it's likely to be our last major tour, but we're still in contact, very close contact with each other, all three of us, and I don't think it's certainly the end of the band. There are still lots of things we want to do. It's not to say that we wouldn't do something in the future on a smaller scale, and there's always the fun project of making a record, which we've all loved forever. Right now I think we're just kind of relaxing and taking it in and getting reconnected with our families and friends and more of a domestic life, and then we'll kinda sort of review it, I think, in the new year and see what we want to do."* [(Source)](http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/6762657/rush-alex-lifeson-r40-tour-interview)

So that's cool. Recently, Ged was asked if he'd do another solo album. He responded:

"Yeah. I think I would do another solo record. I have some ideas I've been working on. I love to play, and at this point, if there's going to be less of my time devoted to playing in Rush then I'm going to have to find a hobby." [(Source)](

But about Rush itself, these are more comments from the same interview:

**Q: [There was a 5 year wait between S A and CA. Is it fair to say there's a new album coming in 2017?]**

*"I'm down with that. I dunno. It's a good question. Honestly, I can't tell you. I wish I knew. I'd say there's a chance."*

**Q: [Would you and Alex do an album together not as Rush if things don't work out?]**

*"Yeah. It's an option."*

**Q: [So do we talk about Rush in the past tense or the present tense?]**

*"The present tense. Very much in the present tense."* [(Source)](http://cygnus-x1.net/links/rush/prog-02.2016.php)

So we know we're getting *something*. 2017 will be the soonest though. We'll just have to wait and see! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I didn't screw anything up today!

This is a great song, very tough to play on bass and probably any instrument. It reminds me of the summer I got into Rush, waiting eagerly for R40. This is probably my favorite song on Signals.

Inspired by an Edgar Lee Masters poem called Jonathan Houghton, the lyrics had a spin on this:

 And a boy lies in the grass

 Near the feet of the old man,

 And looks up at the sailing clouds,

 And longs, and longs, and longs

 For what, he knows not.

Also, according to Neil the girl with "fawn brown legs" was a girl he met whole vacationing in Ohio with his family during the summer of 1967.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been a life long fan of Genesis and Dream Theater (thanks, dad), a fan of Floyd since I was 10ish, a fan of Rush for 2 years (which evolved into me being crazy about them), and I've had an interest in Yes for a year or so. Today, I bought the following records:

* Breathless (Camel)
* Pictures At An Exhibition (Emerson, Lake, and Palmer)
* Tarkus (Emerson...)
* The Missing Piece (Gentle Giant)
* Stormwatch (Jethro Tull)

These are bands I've heard referred to as classic/essential prog, but have never checked out. Right now I have Pictures At An Exhibition playing and it's crazy. I hear its influences in bands I already know. I also like the singer's voice. My only other dive below entry prog was King Crimson, you know which one. It was...quite interesting. I've also read that The Missing Piece is NOT the Gentle Giant album to start with, but that's all they had and it was $2.

What do you think about the albums I got? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Often called their best album, I disagree. While it's good for sure, I just like others more. There have been days though where it temporarily pops to #1.

This was also the first album I learned to play all the way through on bass. Sadly, it's been a bit since I played Camera Eye so I'll probably have to relearn it.

Song rankings from favorite to least (1 favorite, 7 is least)

1. YYZ 10/10
2. Red Barchetta 10/10
3. Tom Sawyer 10/10
4. Limelight 10/10
5. Vital Signs 9/10
6. The Camera Eye 8/10
7. Witch Hunt 8/10

Overall rating is about 9/10.

Not perfect, but damn close. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What do you guys think of this? - Scenes From A Memory Extended </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-06 00:14:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was bored, so I thought it would be fun to come up with an extended version of Scenes. It's across 3 acts with a total of 12 scenes and 30 songs (roughly). Each additional song has a similar meaning to what's occurring in the story/with the characters. Some songs, like This Dying Soul, have a different meaning, but you should be able to get them by just glancing at the lyrics. If you want me to elaborate anywhere, just let me know. Anyway, the tracklist goes:

**ACT 1: Metropolis**

Scene 1

	1. Regression
	2. Someone Like Him Part 1 (intro to Part 1 of Octavarium)

	11. Space-Dye Vest
	12. Metropolis Part 3 (clip from Metropolis Part 2 Demo)
		From: 10:31 roughly
		To: 13:19 roughly
	13. Through Her Eyes

**ACT 2: Home**

Scene 1

	14. Home Part 1
		From: 0:00
		To: 4:38 Roughly
	15. Someone Like Him Part 2 (the rest of Part 1 of Octavarium)

		To: 12:53
	21. The Dance Of Eternity

**ACT 3: One Last Time**

	22. Metropolis Part 4 (clip from Metropolis Part 2 Demo)
		From: 13:21

<TITLE> Any songs with clear inspiration? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-05 10:37:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know a few:

* The Decision is ***obviously*** inspired by Flight Of The Conchords.

* Three Minutes Of Ecstasy has a very Bee Gees feel to it. Namely Nights On Broadway

* Accept My Shaft is straight up The Doors with Dan's vocals and the piano. It's almost The Changeling + End Of The Night

* The Sacred Chalice reminds me of something, but I can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe a bit of Genesis is in there.

* Everybody Shut Up! is reminiscent of Tenacious D I guess all of the skits are too.

* Rhinoceratops Vs Superpuma is clearly inspire by Flight Of The Conchord's Hiphopopotamus Vs Rhymenoceros

* 6969 is Rush inspired in many ways. It's main song is reminiscent of the Synth Era (Signals-Hold Your Fire) and the end is ripped from By-Tor And The Snowdog </TEXT>

<TEXT> EDIT: Sorry, I was talking to someone about the Dream Theater song Heaven's Cove while making the last one.

This is a really great instrumental and easily one of their best songs ever. A great song to play on any instrument.

If I had one criticism, it'd have to be that this was *clearly* a drum and bass jam. They even said Dirk and Pratt made it while in a barn and Alex was doing something in the house. However, that guitar solo is awesome.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I noticed this first with Headlong Flight's similarities to Bastille Day in both key, riffs, and structure. But then I was thinking and though Caravan seemed similar to Fly By Night. I went through the rest of the album and found some songs that were similar to other Rush songs. It'd fit with the theme of the album (looking back on life) and the story clearly being about Neil with Rush. Do you agree with my thoughts?

Caravan - Fly By Night

BU2B - A Passage To Bangkok

Clockwork Angels - Cygnus X-1 (both parts)

The Anarchist - The Fountain Of Lamneth (specifically Didacts And Narpets) and Driven possibly

Carnies - What You're Doing

Halo Effect - Closer To The Heart

Seven Cities Of Gold - Scars

The Wreckers - Grand Designs

Headlong Flight - Bastille Day

Wish Them Well - Workin Them Angels and Cinderella Man

The Garden - Different Strings (especially with the piano) and Resist </TEXT>

<TITLE> I ordered pizza and got it from the delivery man! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-31 23:53:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ordering was rough especially when I could hear my own voice reading the credit card number. Plus the girl on the other end was nice but it felt like she was judging me. The pizza guy arrived early and I raced up stairs for change. I stuttered a bit while talking, fumbled with the change, scribbled a "signature", tried to give him back the pizza while taking the receipt, and then tried to give him the receipt when he wanted the pen. Then he left and my dog went after him and wouldn't come when I called so he ended up walking back to the house with my dog trailing him. I also was wearing a dirty shirt that I've been wearing for a bit over a week straight and pajama bottoms.

Thank you count: 6

<DATE> 2016-01-30 03:44:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> ***TL;DR - "As a very young boy, Nafaryus was always zipping in and out of the palace halls and buzzing around his fathers feet trying to get the busy Emperors attention (hence the nickname BUG)."***

*"One day while on one of these journeys [Faythe] stumbled upon the Great Hall of Artifacts buried deep within its underground corridors. It is here that she found something remarkable; an antique digital music player very common during decades past but now deemed obsolete. It was filled with thousands of songs from all sorts of talented artists from a distant time when music was still created and performed by humans. It had a strange engraving on the back that simply said, To BUG. She didnt know what it meant but that never mattered to her."*

___

*"It is then that Empress Arabelle expresses that shes seen enough of this stubbornness between [Faythe and Bug] and enlightens [Bug] to the fact that if he doesnt agree to this meeting, his daughter will never forgive him and that he will lose her forever.*

*I remember a time when you too possessed Faythes romantic innocence and passion for lifes unexplored mysteriesBUG. says Arabelle to her husband.*

*It is then that Faythe realizes that the word BUG inscribed on the back of her music player was referring to her father and that it once belonged to him!*

*It had been given to him as a gift by his own father who shared the same secret affinity for music made by humans as Faythe eventually would. As a very young boy, Nafaryus was always zipping in and out of the palace halls and buzzing around his fathers feet trying to get the busy Emperors attention (hence the nickname BUG). The rare times when he wasn't consumed with balancing the many affairs of The Realm, his father would privately submit to the therapeutic bliss of his own secretly kept digital music player, oftentimes inviting young Nafaryus to indulge in these undisclosedsoul-soothing escapes. His gift of themusic player to his son was his way of letting Nafaryus know that they would always have that special connection no matter how complicated life may eventually get."* </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm bored today and figured I'd help everybody by doing whatever they might think could help summon a leak for the album were so desperately waiting for. Drop a comment with a (SFW) idea and I'll make an edit with proof that I tried it, saying **Wither** or not it worked. (I just kind of wanna do goofy shit at your command)

Edit 1: Whether. The wither thing was a pun.

Edit 2: Another rule is that it had to be free and realistic. Jesus Christ.

Edit 3: While denying /u/DTnoxon (dtf admin?) 2 million dollars was satisfying, it did not provide a leak.

Edit 4: I got an idea. I'm going to take my dog on a 14 minute (8+5) walk. Possibly this could provide something.

Edit 5: /u/DTnoxon claims to own it already. He may be our only hope. But I don't have $2mil

Edit 6: My walk has just begun. Picture proof coming asap

Edit 7: wait until Monday came up. I'll try.

Edit 8: Here's [picture proof](http://i.imgur.com/Q9W1CES.jpg)

Edit 9: I summoned the dark eternal night who supposedly brings leaks, but he was just kind of in a pissy mood. </TEXT>

**Lyrics**

 nbsp;

When the dragons grow too mighty

To slay with pen or sword

I grow weary of the battle

And the storm I walk toward

When all around is madness

And there's no safe port in view

I long to turn my path homeward

To stop a while with you

 nbsp;

When life becomes as barren

And as cold as winter skies

There's a beacon in the darkness

In a distant pair of eyes

In vain to search for honor

In vain to search for truth

But these things can still be given

Your love has shown me proof </TEXT>

Today, I'm in a huge rush (woke up late and we're doing stuff in school) so I'm sorry, but this has to be a quick post. I'll start posting the evening before or at least preparing posts.

<TEXT> I'm going to be on Rushcast on Monday and we're recording Saturday. If you don't know, each episode from now to 19 weeks is going to be about a specific album. I'm recording an episode on Caress Of Steel and am wondering if there are some facts about the album that I don't know </TEXT>

<TITLE> So what have you figured out about The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-12 13:25:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm trying to figure it out and have been stuck for a week. I got the story, but I'm struggling with the other layers. I've got some easy things.

1. It's very obvious that The Chamber Of 32 Doors is about how Peter needs guidance in his life.

2. I'm thinking Lilywhite Lilith could be a metaphor for Jonathan King who helped Genesis get into the music industry. They played off of each other and he led them to a secret path, them stumbling in the dark, and eventually finding the light.

3. The Colony Of Slippermen is about Peter realizing that if he keeps following his libido, all that will happen is he will get an STD (he'll look like the Slippermen).

4. Brother John is both Rael and Peter's goodness that was displayed in Counting Out Time, which wasn't his first sexual encounter mind you, but his first *romantic* encounter. This is pretty obvious.

5. At The Light Dies Down On Broadway I find new meanings which bugs me as it contradicts some of the others. It makes me think that Brother John may be Genesis (which is struggling), New York could be life before Genesis (which he's always able to return to without struggle), and his dick being carried by the Raven represents the movie that he was given the ability to work on (which the creator of shooed him away because he didn't want to be the reason for breaking up Genesis)

Those are just some thoughts though.

What do you have? </TEXT>

Lyrics

 nbsp;

And the men who hold high places

Must be the ones who start

To mold a new reality

Closer to the heart

Closer to the heart

The blacksmith and the artist

Reflect it in their art

They forge their creativity

Closer to the heart

Closer to the heart

 nbsp;

Philosophers and ploughmen

Each must know his part

To sow a new mentality

Closer to the heart

Closer to the heart

You can be the captain

I will draw the chart

Sailing into destiny

Closer to the heart </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's the first day using this account instead of my old one. This is probably my all time favorite Rush song! It's just really awesome. Fun little fact, it was sped up slightly to fit properly on the record (iirc) so it sounds sharp, but it's barely noticeable unless you overlay it.

**Lyrics**

 nbsp;

'To seek the sacred river Alph

To walk the caves of ice

To break my fast on honeydew

And drink the milk of Paradise...'

 nbsp;

I had heard the whispered tales of immortality

The deepest mystery

From an ancient book I took a clue

I scaled the frozen mountain tops of eastern lands unknown

Time and Man alone

Searching for the lost Xanadu

 nbsp;

Xanadu...

 nbsp;

To stand within the Pleasure Dome

Decreed by Kubla Khan

To taste anew the fruits of life

The last immortal man

To find the sacred river Alph

To walk the caves of ice

Oh, I will dine on honeydew

And drink the milk of Paradise

 nbsp;

A thousand years have come and gone but time has passed me by

Stars stopped in the sky

Frozen in an everlasting view

Waiting for the world to end, weary of the night

Praying for the light

Prison of the lost

Xanadu

 nbsp;

Xanadu...

 nbsp;

Held within the Pleasure Dome

Decreed by Kubla Khan

To taste my bitter triumph

As a mad immortal man

Nevermore shall I return

Escape these caves of ice

For I have dined on honeydew

And drunk the milk of Paradise </TEXT>
