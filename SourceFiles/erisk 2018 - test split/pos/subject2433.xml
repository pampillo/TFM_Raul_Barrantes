<TITLE> [NeedAdvice] I feel its to late to improve myself and there is no point </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was hoping someone can help me out with my situation here. I'm going to be a senior in college, and I'm overweight, feel depressed, u disciplined, and have low confidence and self esteem.

I've read many different articles, posts, etc, on how I can get out of this rut and the steps to take. but then I see that it takes a year or more before I would even see results, and I just do t bother.

Its not the fact that it takes a year that bothers me. its the fact that by the time things get better I will be out of college and into the work zone. I basically wasted away the greatest times I could have had in highschool or college. Had I followed the advice and those steps earlier maybe I could have enjoyed college as a whole new and confident person. but those times in life are gone and I will never get the chance.

so why bother trying to improve, its to late. I will be working my ass off all day at a career with no friends and little social interaction or activities. there's no point in trying to improve myself, the prime times in my life I could have had are all gone. now there's nothing left but working a career for the rest of my life. no chance of having exciting opportunities with friends or my peers, or road trips, or anything else exciting and fun. only work

maybe I'm wrong though. I guess that's why I'm posting this here, I want hope I guess. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've done some thinking as to why I may feel depressed, and one thing that stood out is the fact that I'm always looking for new things in my life to fill some kind of hole or need

this has become destructive though, as I will eat a lot just for the sake of eating because it feels good and different from feeling g depressed, or I'll just by random crap just because it is new

and the this gs I used to like to do, like programming or reading, I just don't find as fun anymore

I'm not sure if this is just a part of depression or if its entirely something different. life feels so unfulfilling and rather boring, and I just keep trying to fill the emptyness with food and useless junk, and I feel jealousy towards those I know who get to live an exciting life and experiencing new experiences I wish I was able to

I'm not sure what exactly to do </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you so so much for writing this man. Ive been just out of it for the last few days and visited reddit again and found your reply. I can relate a lot, and I'll admit too I'm gay as well, though very few people know as I'm not very comfortable with coming out yet

I really like your advice and it was inspiring to read. 

Also a question, do you think the depression ever goes away, or is it always kinda there? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The reason I ask is because I want to know that there has been someone who has been through what I have and made it to the other side.

right now I'm 280 pounds and trying to lose weight. however, making things much harder is a battle with clinical depression (and constant changes in medication), and a  hard past with many depressing moments (including moments where I acted like a friggin bitch) which are hard to escape from

I'm not asking for sympathy or pity. I'm asking for hope. I want to know that there was someone out there that went through a similar battle and came out a changed person, a confident, fit and healthy person, someone completely different from who they were. I want to know that there is hope for me

If anyone could tell the story of their journey, I would really appreciate it </TEXT>

<TITLE> [NeedAdvice] How do I overcome boredom? life seems pointless, dont have the motivation or discipline to do anything </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-01 00:28:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> this entire summer break from college I've done nothing every day except for sitting on my laptop playing video games and other forms of escapism like reading reddit. other than the days where I go to work (which is in a small warehouse by myself) and going to the gym to do the elliptical for 10 min every day (my small goal to do everyday) life seems boring and pointless

I want life to be more exciting and filled with more than just video games and reading. but I don't know what to do, I don't have any friends nearby, dont have much money, and when I do get an idea (like go to a bar) I don't do it because I'm scared.

any time I do try to do something, I feel like I don't have the energy and I just go lay in my bed reading reddit from my phone.

what can I do to overcome this boredom? what can I do to get myself motivated and going? </TEXT>

<TITLE> A Lament and confession </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-31 18:40:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I feel like the best thing to do to make me feel better is to confess what I feel is something Ive done terribly wrong, and to lament on why I'm feeling depressed. Ill explain my logic for this at the end of my post. Andy feedback or advice is extremely appreciated.


As for the terrible thing I did wrong: Right now, im in college and about to go into my senior year in college. My parents are paying for my whole college since I am unable to take out a loan because of my parents finances, and they have set very high standards for me in terms of grades. not even a B is enough for them. They plan on moving to the other side of the country in a year next summer, and they expect me to graduate on time this next summer.


The problem is I wont. I lied to them, I told a big lie saying I was going to graduate on time, I even went to the extreme of pretending to be my advisor saying that I would graduate on time. The reason I wont be able to graduate on time is because I failed calculus (something they would get extremely pissed about and might have even cut off my college funding), and some courses from a community college from a while back didnt transfer over to this college. 


This is bad, my parents want to be able to move and have their plans all set for next summer, and I still wont have graduated. My plan for this was to save up as much money as I can so I can get my own apartment, and take out loans without them knowing when I turn 23 in a month, since FAFSA does not take your parents finances into account for loans once you turn 23. Then I would break the news to them sometime around christmas that I wont graduate on time.


Even though it seems like I solid plan I feel guilty as fuck and feel like a piece of shit for doing this. I dont deserve anything. I dont deserve happiness, I deserve to be depressed, I lied to my own parents, such a big lie


But I had no other choice. I'm so afraid of talking to my parents, and a few months ago I tried telling them the truth, but the moment I did I saw my mom getting furious at me and I got so scared and had to make up a lie saying I didnt know for sure whether I would graduate on time or not, and from there I formulated my bigger lie


I've always been afraid of my mom, I could never go to her for advice because she was always condescending and critical, and always easy to piss off, and extremely stubborn. I know she cares about me, but her attitude prevents me from confronting her about anything. I dont even know how I am going to break the news to them about not graduated on time, im really afraid. My mom has overacted to things many times before. I even remember once she threatened me saying she could make my life hell. yet at the same time she will do things like get me a birthday gift, she pays for my college, she sometimes makes breakfast.



The lament: I seem to have confused hard work and suffering, and used to think that because of the suffering I have endured in life I would be rewarded. I now know thats not the case, you have to work hard to be rewarded, and I feel like the suffering I have gone through in life is extremely unjust.


I missed out all of my highschool because I was very afraid of people, had low confidence and low self esteem. Im still rather afraid of people. Im not sure why im so afraid of people, maybe it was because there were times I was made fun of during middle school or when I was a kid. Maybe thats why i'm so self conscious as well about my weight and stuff


And yet people ask me to help out other people, be a kind person, turn the other cheek, and I dont see why. Why should I help others when there was never anyone to help me out in life during those hard times?! All I would have wanted during those times when I was lonely and depressed, those times when I was laying in my bed crying and weak, I just would have wanted a friend who cared enough to say its ok or to talk to. But no people are so busy with their lives they cant bother to help me when I was in pain or when I was suffering.


There was a time a few years ago when I was near suicidal, where I fucked up a friendship I had with the best friend I ever had, had to take a leave of absence from school for a semester because of it, and go to a community college which was in a bad neighborhood and nowhere near as good as the university I was at. I was at rock bottom, I had pushed away the greatest friend I ever had by being to clingy (he was the greatest friend I ever had and who cared and who I trusted), i was in a shitty place in life, and no one was there. I was alone, no one was there to say things would get better or things would be alright, or to try and cheer me up or keep me from being lonely. NO ONE was there, fucking no one, I had to go through half a year of shit all by my self with no help, and I feel so fucking bitter about it 


tl;dr I think this guilt is the root of my depression, my lack of motivation, my anxiety, and all these other mental problems. I dont see a light at the end of the tunnel, I see this problem as a huge mess that will destroy my life and everything I know in my life will be crushed. why bother trying to accomplish anything or improve myself when my doom is only months away.


The reason why I did the lament, I listened to a speaker at a retreat about a year ago, and he said that something like this:
Trauma - lies - feelings - behavior - circumstances

1. feelings drive the behavior
2. lies drive the feelings
3. trauma drives the lies

and one of the ways to address the trauma is the write a lament. without healing the trauma, we cant change our behavior </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After a lot of thinking it seems that all the fucks I give about stupid things come from the fact that I don't like myself. a lot of the advice I see around here requires you to love yourself or asks if you do

the fact is I don't love myself, or have confidence in myself. maybe its because of all the mistakes I've made in the past, or maybe its because I'm overweight (I'm working on it), maybe its because I always compare myself to other people

I don't know exactly the reason, all I know is I don't know how to love myself, and that doing so is the first step to not giving a fuck

any advice is really appreciated </TEXT>

<TEXT> No I'm not saying I don't want to lose weight. in fact I'm working on it right now. the fact is though, I'm still going to be fat for a while as I'm waiting for the pounds to drop off.

my weight has always been something I'm self-conscious about. I mean, why the hell would a girl want to have anything to do with some nerdy fat guy. even if I'm just trying to make friends with other guys I feel self-conscious about it. I'm always worried about other people seeing me as being 'fat' and nothing else

how can I overcome this in the meantime? my last year of college is coming up and I want to spend this year being confident and crushing my social anxiety </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have social anxiety and low self-esteem, and I want to get rid of it. while I've gotten better at it, I'm not at the point where I can just go to random people and start a conversation

my confidence is low and my self-esteem is also low. 2 things seem to contribute to this

1. my weight. I'm working on it, but it takes time. my weight has always been something I'm self-conscious about. I mean, why the hell would a girl want to have anything to do with some nerdy fat guy. even if I'm just trying to make friends with other guys I feel self-conscious about it. I'm always worried about other people seeing me as being 'fat' and nothing else

2. I seem to always compare myself to other people. I don't know why it happens, it just does. I sometimes wish I was as successful as other people, and I really wish I was confident and loved myself like everyone else seems to be. I wish I could overcome my social anxiety and be able to post my success story here like others

I'll also admit too, I don't like myself because of these faults and I have trouble loving myself, and many people even say I'm too hard on myself

my last year of college begins in one month, and when I move in I want to be confident enough to go meet all the new people in my dorm, knock on peoples doors and start conversations, and just not give a fuck about what people think of me. any advice on trying to achieve this goal and to just get rid of my social anxiety or I.prove self esteem is appreciated </TEXT>

<TEXT> I realized that a lot of my problems come from trying to impress people in order for them to like me and possibly become friends.

but do people really look at all the things you've accomplished and all the things you've done to determine if your worthy of being a friend? apparently that seems to be my mindset, and that's the reason I do things just to impress people

so what do people look for in others when determining whether they can be a good friend or not. or another way to think of it, what determines our worth as a person? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> after some thinking over why I feel bad when I was trying to achieve my goals and why I've failed at my recent goals, I realized I was basically saying to myself "I can't do it". and that thought was basically caused by me feeling like I'm worthless, or I'm not good enough

thinking more about it, I don't know she. I started thinking like this, but its been that way for as long as I can remember. and further, there's proof in my life that seems to fuel the thought of being worthless, like the fact that I haven't achieved anything significant in life, rarely ever worked my ass off in comparison to other people, and just have always been lazy and have nothing to show for my life

either way, its dragging me down, and I want to know how to reverse this thinking and be more positive.

I know it may not be entirely related to getting disciplined, but everyone here has given me such good advice already, and this feeling/thoughts are what are keeping me from achieving my goals and getting disciplined </TEXT>

She thought she was helping me making my life easier but really she was setting me up for failure because I never learned how to be the leader of my life. Subconsciously, I am constantly searching for someone else to make me happy or tell me what to do.

<TEXT> I was recently diagnosed with depression by a physician, and it seems to fit. it kinda explains why its been so hard to try and achieve goals and improve.

has anyone here been able to work through it though and overcome it? as I mentioned, its so hard right now to achieve goals like trying to lose weight,and going to the gym doesn't seem to help even though I thought its supposed to. right now it just feels like I'm not living life, and even more so since the days just seem to drag on with nothing to do, and usually ends up with me going to bed extremely early

so any tips on achieving goals and being productive while depressed? I don't want to have to wait for months while the meds they gave me take effect before I can start doing things.

also has anyone been able to completely conquer depression and lead a happy and successful life? </TEXT>

<TEXT> my friend pointed this out to me the other day, and he's right, I am always comparing my life to others and it is always making me miserable and ruining my goals

for some reason, I always see myself as inferior to other people when I compare myself or others, or my life seems less fun and exciting when comparing it to other peoples

it makes it feel like I need to play catch up with other people in life. every time I try starting a goal, it ends up turning into "but this friend is already way ahead of me, I'll never catch up to him so why bother"

I also compare my quality of life with others. for example, this summer break from college I'm stuck at home with no friends, while everyone from college is posting on Facebook about going on road trips with friends and doing all kinds of things like that which I wish I could be doing this summer.

I don't know how to stop. Its hard to avoid, since it seems like it always happens when people talk about their lives. and my life always seems to suck in comparison </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you very much to take the time to type that reply, it seems to straighten things out.

Not sure if my therapist will agree with my mother being bad, she says she is a great mother. However, my therapist does think she goes overboard on things and that I deserve more independence

It is very hard for me to say no or to stand up for myself, and your right i do do everything i can to avoid confrontation (including lying), and i apologize to people for all kinds of stupid little mistakes i make or even think i made, especially ones in social situations. But I'm not exactly sure what to do about it. These behaviors have really affected my social life with other people and I want to change them.

Also, how would I go about reprogramming that voice inside my head? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the reply

You mentioned lack of support from parents, and I think that may play a role in this

My parents didn't abuse me, and they did provide me with the essentials and more, such as Christmas presents or sometimes helping me pay for college, but they were always overtly strict and critical, and yelled a lot

I'm also afraid of coming to them for any advice because I'm afraid of them being critical of me, and for the many reasons I will mention below. My parents are also overly stubborn, and trying to reason with them is tough, and my mom always seems to think she is right

I'll admit, I try to avoid my parents as often as I can because they always seem to point out my faults or criticize me, even though they are trying to help. 

My mom also seems to criticize me all the time. She always points out how I'm overweight and should do something about it, and similar things like being on the computer too much, or spending too much money, or not being productive. Sure I may be bad with my money, but complaining to me all the time just makes it worse

They also get angry or upset easily. One example, a year ago I said I might be able to help out with the car insurance because I knew a guy who works at the insurance agency we get our insurance from. Instead of being thankful, my mom yells at me asking if I gave out are insurance information, and scolds me saying how I shouldn't give anyone our insurance information. Situations like this have happened more times than I can even remember.

Or my parents would get mad or overreact at very small things. One time, I left a few wrappers on the table and forgot to throw them away. Later that day, I get a bunch of angry texts from my mom, saying how I'm so immature and irresponsible, and how I shouldn't leave wrappers laying around. She then sends pictures of the wrappers to my therapist asking her to talk with me about why I did that.

And my mom yelling at me, even today that's one of the things I fear most. I lie a lot to them just to appease them, and because of fear of being yelled at or punished. I also want to know I'm right for once in my life </TEXT>

Like you said, it would take a few years, but I don't have that kind of time. 

I don't know why, but I wanted to have this kind of confidence and stuff while I was in college so I could have a good experience there and find a bunch of friends and have a good time, but now I'm gonna be a senior this year so why bother, after college its just work

I guess the problem now is why bother, I guess its a step in the right direction though </TEXT>

<TEXT> that's why I feel like killing myself. whenever I think I try to figure out the reason why I'm depressed, its always something different or something I cant do anything about. or for all I know all of those things are the cause of my depression, and its just too big of a mess to even clean up.

maybe its life is just so unfair and there's no explanation behind why things are unfair, and there's no point in anything in life if things are unfair. all the unfair things just get me frustrated and depressed. I can't stop focusing on the unfair things.

for all I know the depression is too comfortable and I'm afraid to even leave it, maybe that's why, but I dont know for sure

or maybe its because I'm overweight and I can never achieve my goals of losing weight, I always fuck up every time I try. every time I get frustrated because something unfair happens, I just eat because it feels good, and I feel like I should treat myself in order to male things fair again

I'm just so tired of being depressed and life sucking I kinda just want it to end </TEXT>

Another reason to why I probably don't help myself I just realized, is because it feels like I've dug myself into too deep of a hole, and it just would take way too much effort and time to dig out of. I feel like I wasted my youth so why bother, I'm already 23. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Im not exactly sure why I haven't sought them out yet. One reason may be that I'm afraid to not be depressed, like I've been depressed for so long its become normal. Another reason may be is because I don't believe it would help, or that I wouldn't be able to follow the instructions because I don't have confidence in myself. Another reason that might be is because I'm waiting for some special moment in life that makes me not depressed, or someone to come along, and then that moment or person changes my outlook in life.

I've read many articles on stuff like this and seen a few videos, and while it gives me hope and motivation for about a day, after that its gone.

I've also been seeing a counselor for therapy already , but like the above, I feel good and hopefully for about a day after seeing the counselor, but then it usually goes away after a day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> im not sure where else to ppost this, but this seemed apporpriate. ive been trying to find out why ive been depressed, and after doing some thinking and meditation and trying to figure out the reasons behind the way i feel I think one of the big reasons I may be depressed is because life is unfair and I feel bitter.

Ever since I've been a kid no one ever explained to me the reason behind all the bad things that happened to me, and it made me feel bitter, and I still do. I mean if people can do bad shit and get away with it, and bad things happen to those who didnt deserve it, then what the fuck is keeping the world from falling apart? Why isn't there total chaos if order simply does not exist? What is the point?

I was reading something too, about something called existential depression. Its basically where your too smart for your own good and you think about the reasons behind everything, and you get depressed at the results of what you do, or don't, see. I don't see the point behind things in life. </TEXT>

I'm basically stuck at home right now and so damn lonely, and I don't know how to make friends around here. I'm asking for books because books do seem to help me calm down when i read them and not feel so frustrated.

I'm afraid of approaching people and I dont even know where to begin to try and make friends. I did try meetup.com, but the only groups nearby are basically for mothers. I thought of going to a bar but I'm afraid of going to a bar alone. I would try the gym I go to, but I don't know where to start there either.

I'm trapped, frustrated, and depressed from being lonely, and I don't know what to do. </TEXT>

I'm in Brookfield right now, and on summer break from college right now, and I have no friends at home so its quite boring, i'm really tired of sitting around all day at home playing video games, and it would be nice to get out and do something with people.

also if you work out and want to work out together that would be awesome too, since I'm working out on trying to lose weight and working out with other people is much more fun

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> hi, I've been going to the gym every day in an effort to try and lose weight, as well as trying to follow a diet for the last month or so

problem is I'm losing at every turn and obsticle. I do go to the gym every day, but after 15 min on an elliptical I get so worn out/bored that I just can't continue any longer, and that's even with watching Netflix on my phone. I do try to do weights, but because I'm intimidated by most of the guys doing weights I'm restricted to maybe 4 machines which I do each time I'm there. I had a feeling that getting a gym buddy would help, but I have no friends nearby and its doubtful that anyone on reddit goes to the same gym in Chicago suburbs I do

and for the eating part I'm doing very bad too. I'm trying to follow a strict diet my mom did to lose weight, and I mean its really strict about everything, even which fruits and vegetables you can eat. well every day I'm finding that I cheat, usually going out to get 2 big slices of pizza everyday. yesterday was the worst, were I was bored and instead of going to the gym I go to McDonald's and eat there, then go to the story and get candy and eat all of it.

its like I don't even have the motivation to lose weight, even though I want to. I keep getting the thought In my mind that I can't do it, I try to fight it but looking at all my recent fuck ups, like cheating everyday, it really seems like I can't do this, even more so since I've been big for as long as I can remember. it doesn't help either that my mom is constantly trying to guilt trip me into doing this, it just makes me feel like shit and less wanting to do it

what can I do to get on track and get motivated at the gym and to eat better? what can I do to stop the negative attitude? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Will do, thanks. It looks promising so I'll give it a shot. Also, Any recommendations for which CBT book I should get?

One more thing though maybe you can help me with. One reason I realized I have trouble making friends is because I'm too afraid to approach people, and go out and do new things by myself. I realize I missed many opportunities in life because of this, like my entire highschool period where I made no friends at all. I guess I'm really just very shy too but I don't know how to get over it.

I also feel like I'm so different from other people because it feels like I don't share the same experiences that so many other people have, such as having a significant other, or having an awesome highschool experience, or working very hard to achieve some goal. It feels like I don't fit in and it upsets me for some reason, even when people like me I still feel like I don't fit in because I don't have similar experiences. I haven't worked very hard at things in my life either, either that or the things I worked hard at didn't amount to anything or ended up having no value </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks.

I also think I just don't like the way my life is going. Right now I'm on summer break, and because I made all my friends in college they live far away and I can't really see them much.

So basically everyday is spent mostly in my room, except for the hour or 2 I spend at the gym, or the days I have work, which is just me by myself in a small warehouse. So everyday feels like I'm not living life, and lonely. That's a big reason why I want people to like me too is so I have people to do awesome things with and its not so lonely and everyday not the same. And it also offers another reason for the jealousy too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks man, really appreciate it.

Have you also had experience with jealousy and friends? One thing that really got me down yesterday was when I stumbled across a photo of one of my friends having a great time on vacation somewhere. Not only was I jealous that he was having a good time, but I was extremely jealous that I couldn't go with. And I know this guy is a good friend as he has proved it many times

I just get so jealous when friends do awesome things without me, I get jealous that I miss out on those experiences. I even get jealous of random strangers which I see having a good time with other people.

Maybe this also ties into not liking being alone </TEXT>

I guess I just want friends and don't want to be lonely too, and I'm willing to do everything to do that, even change who I really am, for friends. Most of my summer has been spent by myself and I don't like it because I don't have any friends nearby and I'm lonely

Fear of rejection I guess, which is odd because I've been rejected before, and even hated, and I would think I would be used to it or something </TEXT>

<TEXT> hi, Im posting this on a few subreddits because I really think this is the source of my problems. self-pity.

I recently then read something along the lines of misery is comfort, thought about it a bit, and felt maybe that's the way I feel.I pity myself. it seems to explain a lot of the way i feel in life, and how I act around my friends. it explains why I give up so easily and why it seems so hard for me to follow through with advice people give

I saw a link to a video on the wiki in the decidingtobebetter subreddit about someone talking about self pity, but unfortunately it did not say what to do about it. searching reddit did not come up with anything either

so what can be done about self pity? how do I stop it? how do I get out of this negative cycle? </TEXT>
