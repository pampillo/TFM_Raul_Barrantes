* A lot of people will tell you they end up just leaving the numpad side on the arrow key configuration and just use the number row. You can make a thread and ask if you'd like proof.
* The non-standard bottom row is a real problem. If you want this keyboard to be a quality peripheral, you're going to want to replace the keycaps sooner rather than later, and then you're going to be SOL.

A MUCH better option is the Masterkeys M, which is the replacement for the TK. </TEXT>

Right, but you can do some research on the availability of devs who know a particular platform. If there are 10x more Unity devs than Gamemaker devs, you know it's going to be easier hiring for the former.

 There is also the matter of determining whether or not they are actually doing a good job.

Best advice I can come up with: look for someone who speaks easily about what they do   how to solve problems (without using jargon!), and who can show examples of their work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I find this question interesting, because my answer to this would classically assume that the person doing the hiring is a programmer themselves.

In terms of tech stack, it depends. If you were looking for a "co-founder" so to speak, then it would be their decision in the end (though you'd be within your rights to ask to understand the reasoning, and to give your outside opinion). But if you're essentially looking for a freelancer, the decision should probably rest with you, as you will be the one having to hire future programmers to complete the game. </TEXT>

I think this is a key point. How easy do you think it is to start a new ISP?

Your arguments seem to be of the "free market" variety - reduce government involvement, let competition run its course, if a service is bad a competitor will arise, etc. But the real world has repeatedly shown that market failure is frequent in free markets. Some things simply require governmental interference, else they work to the detriment of society. Given the importance of the internet in the modern world, it is utterly critical that the internet must be available   free (as in speech). We cannot leave it to the free market for a couple of decades and just see what happens. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a bunch of reasons, some pro-socialism and others anti-capitalism. One is that we are finally beginning to see that neoliberalism does not, in fact, provide for everyone and ensure prosperity (see the Occupy protests a few years back). Another is that a bunch of trails on the viability of universal basic income (UBI) are showing astounding results. Another is that automation is threatening to kill many jobs, which cannot simply be supplanted by new jobs (truckers and factory workers can't just reskill at the drop of a hat, they would have to effectively start over with their careers, and then they're competing with younger people in an already saturated job market). Another is that we no longer associate socialism with Russia or the Eastern Bloc, but rather with progressive societies such as the Nordic countries.

There's a bunch more reasons like this, but the short answer is: because that's what people think is better than what we have now. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I want to be able to make web apps and actual applications with buttons and stuff but I have no idea where to even start with that kind of thing. 

Not to be snarky, but google "how to write C++ gui application" or "how to write C++ web app" to get an idea.

 I'm only a couple classes in, so my knowledge about this is pretty small, but when thinking of things I want to program, it's difficult to think of anything where I even have a clue where to start.

You have to get good at modeling problems. Let's say you want a web app that lets you locate friendly dogs in your area. What does that take? Hmm, you'd need to have a way to find dogs. Maybe dog owners can register their pets on the site (that means you need a database to store the dogs   their locations). And you're talking about location, so you'd need some code that lets you work with location. Ideally you'd integrate it with map data to make it easier to find a dog to pet, so perhaps see what it would take to integrate with Google Maps. And, uh... you store each dog's location, and when someone searches for nearby dogs, you limit it to... uh... 2 miles? and then show all the dogs in that radius. Maybe by putting pins on a map.

Train yourself to break down a problem like this into components that you can address directly.

 Aside from that, how do people use APIs?

An API is just an interface - a specification for how to communicate.

Broadly speaking, there are two definitions for "API" in common use:

1. The way a particular library is used. jQuery (a popular JS library) has a method called `$()` that does almost everything. There's documentation that tells you, okay, if you want to find all paragraphs on a page, you do `$('p')`, and then you can call stuff like `.on()` or `.hide()` on the result. That's an API.
2. Web-based interfaces for the systems underlying an application. You can make HTTP requests to `https://na.api.pvp.net/api/lol/na/v1.4/summoner/by-name/` to get data about a particular League of Legends player on the North America server, like their competitive rank or their favourite champion. This is all detailed in some documentation somewhere.

 I know I can make web apps and such with javascript or whatever, and I know a bit of javascript, but at the moment I want to just focus on one language until I get a good grasp of that so I don't mix stuff up while I'm still learning.

Javascript is **the only language** that a modern web browser understands. You can write your back end in any goddamn language you want, but your front end **must** be javascript. </TEXT>

When the discussion is about things that explicitly happened to me, then yes, I do. If you say "all black people are scum", don't be surprised when a black person takes offence.

 Also so funny how you believe that people with certain disorders are dangerous... they use to think that about people with depression and anxiety. They represent a small minority, if you actually look at the statistics.

Your reading comprehension is lacking, so let me bold the important part for you:

Schizophrenia, PTSD, et al are scary because they **sometimes** cause people to do violent things.

 Finally, your last comment makes me laugh because you still think this is about you.....

See above. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I made it clear that he chose not to study for his exams

So if a depressed person commits suicide, they choose to do that? When a schizophrenic hears voices, they choose to do that? When a person with generalised anxiety fails to follow through on responsibilities, they choose to do that?

Besides that: having a mental illness means you are at an unfair disadvantage. If you occasionally get an unfair advantage (like getting an extension even though you didn't study), that still puts you at net negative, so it is forgivable.

 I NEVER said you didn't deserve support, so don't shove words down my throat.

Yes you did. Here:

 These people need to stop this circle jerk of pity

That "circle jerk of pity" is also known as "asking for support".

---

 Also where the fuck did I tell you how to deal with it, hm?

I dunno, maybe your entire post? You are saying people are not allowed to get free passes because they have a mental illness, which implies that we must just... "man up"?

 I don't know what is wrong with asking why everyone is so quick to support people who post about their depression, but not people with the more taboo disorders.

Schizophrenia, PTSD, et al are scary because they sometimes cause people to do violent things. How hard is this to understand?

 But the sad truth is people don't owe us anything just because we have a disorder. We don't get instant forgiveness or pass when we fuck up. ALL humans fuck up, and sometimes we need to accept that it is out own fault.

HOW IS IT MY FAULT WHEN I HAVE A BROKEN BRAIN THAT DOES NOT LET ME FUNCTION NORMALLY?

Again: you are saying that committing suicide is your own fault. Not the fault of fucked up chemicals in your brain. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If the hiring process entails you remembering something, you don't want to work there.

A good technical interview will ask you to _do_ something, not _remember_ something. For example, when I interviewed for my current job, they gave me this challenge:

 There is an array of 1001 elements, containing the numbers 1 through 1000. One of those numbers is duplicated. Find the duplicate number without accessing the array more than once.

Often, what they want to see is not just your problem-solving process, but also whether you ask the right questions. Asking no questions at all is usually a bad thing. You may for instance want to clarify what they mean by accessing the array only once. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Sorry, but if you changed i to animal_id in that for loop example, you would be 100% incorrect. The index of an array element is categorically not the same thing as the id value of an object.

That's splitting hairs, and you know it. I _specifically_ said "or something of that nature". My point was that in a particular application, the index might represent the id of the animal. Or do you have more information about the application that says otherwise?

 idiomatic code is important to aim for.

It's discouraged when the purpose is something other than learning. It's encouraged when the purpose is learning.

Things to know in advance:

* Stabilise your API as much as possible. That means don't change it often, and if you have to change it, give people warning. (It's usually considered more okay to change your API a lot before you reach v1.0.) This means you should decide up front (as far as possible) which public methods your library will have, what arguments they will take, and what they will return.
* WRITE A THOROUGH SET OF UNIT TESTS, FOR **EVERYTHING**.
* Manage your dependencies well. Don't assume the user environment has e.g. jQuery available. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay so about a month?

You can probably do it, but you have to start now and be smart about how you go about it. First step: make a single button that plays a sound file.

A listener is basically just a thing that lets you attach a function (behaviour) to an event (a button click). Very straightforward.

Exceptions are used to handle errors. Ignore them for now.

You are going to have your hands full just making one button, loading a file into memory, and playing the audio. Just get that working. Once it's working you can expand the concept to a grid of buttons. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know that. But I also know that I often encounter it in code, and I also know I prefer a name that actually communicates something about what the variable means.

Think of it like this: error tracebacks in some languages will print the precise line where the error is from. Tools like grep will by default only return the particular line that matches, not the surroundings. In those cases, it's much nicer to have something slightly descriptive than the universal `i` that could mean literally anything. </TEXT>

Support heroes are like the rubber in the childs retort: whatever is said about them bounces back and reflects on the speaker.

I'm confident no-one actually thinks like this. "I better not criticise that person, because it will reflect poorly on me." The real reason no-one will ask a healer to switch to Widow is because people are slaves to the meta. No-one does enough self-reflection to have an insight of the kind you're describing.

Beyond that, they classically do the "omfg stop playing bad" thing.

 There is no similar feedback for support picks that dont contribute (because the rest of the team is not contributing).

<TEXT>  Thanks for listening and lowering the threshold, but is there any chance that it could be back to normal speed but remain higher pitched? The speed is still weird-sounding.

This is sadly how sound works. The "natural" way to pitch a sound up or down is to make it faster/slower (pitch is frequency, so to increase the frequency you need more cycles per second, which means you have to make the sound go faster).

In order to preserve the speed, you'd have to employ pretty advanced pitch-shifting techniques that try to like deconstruct the sound into individual granules   repeat them intelligently. This is way, way, way harder to do (in terms of engineering   CPU) than the naive method. </TEXT>

I know how to do all these things:

* Retrieve an element from a collection
* Compare two elements
* Act based on the result
* Recur
* Return

So then just stick those together, you know? </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, they really can't. I'm a software developer. I know how this stuff goes. Riot has a billion and one things to do. They can't afford to keep old shit around just for the sake of players like you who prefer the old client. It stops them from moving forward.

Think of it like this: there's the upcoming 10 ban system. Now, if they have to maintain the old client in parallel, it takes longer to get the 10 ban system released because of the old client being hard to maintain. So **everyone** has to wait an extra two months before they get the feature they want. This is bad for the game and bad for the community.

But even worse: what if there's a critical issue in the old client that completely prevents 10 bans from being implemented? Now you can't publish that feature for **anyone**, just because a small percentage of players prefer the old client. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I'm having to look at uni's I want to go to next year and choosing the right course and that is freaking me out to start with.

As a 29-year-old who studied 4 different things before figuring out what I wanted, this drives me insane. An 18-year-old should not be expected to know what they want to do with the rest of their life. But sadly that is how society is currently structured, and there's not a whole lot you can do about it.

If you can, it might be a really good idea to take a year off before you go to uni and maybe do something like working retail.

 But I can't tell them I'm upset they're leaving because I want them to peruse their dreams and do what they want - I don't want them to feel bad for having a life.

A big part of having mature conversations with your loved ones is understanding that you can say you are unhappy about something without blaming or making the other party feel bad. It would be healthy for you to tell them you will miss them.

Relationships take work, but if your instinct is that your boyfriend is not a good presence in your life, it may be time to move on. Even if that is scary. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There was a really great article on /r/programming about this just the other day! http://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2014/04/09/six-programming-paradigms-that-will/

But most of those suggestions are very much "out there" - they're basically a bunch of esolangs (esoteric languages) that exist more as experiments than anything else.

So if you want something useful that has a future, functional programming is absolutely the way to go. I would suggest Clojure - it strikes a really nice balance between hardcore functional programming (it's a Lisp)   real-world usability (many, many companies use it in production; it runs on the Java virtual machine and has a JS version called ClojureScript). [Clojure for the Brave and True](https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/) is the best programming book I have ever read.

EDIT: The reason I (and others) suggest FP is this. It's a completely different way of thinking about code. All four of the languages you mentioned ultimately boil down to *imperative* code. That means they do things by giving a list of steps to take; the result is implied by the steps. FP is *declarative*. This means it boils down to saying what the result looks like; the steps are implied by the result. It will bend your mind, I promise. :)

It has a fun second benefit, which is homoiconicity, the favoured buzzword of Lisp hackers. The TL;DR is that the way the computer represents your code internally looks almost exactly like you represent the code in the text. That means the language can make it really easy to let you write code that _produces code_. You can do absolutely mind-blowing shit like this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't play Shattered, but I think your questions are pretty general. Shattered players feel free to correct me.

 Lately I've been saving my potions trying to find scrolls of identify but I feel like I just end up dying with them later on. Is it better to just drink them or throw them to see what I've got?

Just drink them, for the most part. You can often tell which ones are the healing pots - you tend to get way more of them than any other type. You can also use deduction to figure out things like fire pots - you will always guaranteed get at least 1 fire pot on a level with a wooden obstacle. So if you have 3 identified potions and 1 unidentified, and you've cleared the level, and there's a wooden obstacle, it's a fire pot.

 Is it better to basically fully explore all the levels up to Goo before trying to fight it?

You should be fully exploring every single level! Until the late game, anyway. You get little enough loot already, no sense in further limiting it.

 I feel like I'm not increasing my strength that much. It might be because of question #2 about the potions but it feels like I'm finding a good amoung of weapons and armor I simply can't use.

You guessed it.

 Should I wait until I've basically collected everything within a level before using scrolls?

This is what I typically do. You don't want to wait too long on identifying things, but if you read an unidentified scroll and discover it's an identify scroll, and you have nothing in your inventory to identify, you lose out.

 Or is it simply a case of search only when it seems like there could be a room/hallway attached?

You will get too hungry if you search every room. Better to search the ones that seem likely. You build an instinct for this over time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a universal problem in online games. It goes a little like this:

* The goal of the game is to complete X objective.
* A "meta" exists, which is a generally accepted set of strategies that _usually_ maximise the chances of achieving X.
* Therefore, following the meta will _on average_ maximise your chances of victory.
* (Here's where it breaks down.) Therefore, _an individual_ player _not_ following the meta means you _will_ lose.

Essentially, people become more concerned with playing the game "correctly" (i.e. according to their subjective interpretation of the meta) than with playing the game _successfully_.

 I'm also a gamer, will a flashed handwired keyboard like this may end up being calculated as "scripts/cheats" in games? For example from Valve?

No. As far as your computer is concerned, your keyboard is a stock standard Microsoft 104-key. All a keyboard is is a device for emitting keycodes. Your "keyboard" could be a DDR dance pad, for all your computer knows; all it really knows for sure is that it is receiving keycodes. 

However, if you start programming macros (multiple key outputs in a short time from one shortcut), then yes, this can be detected (because you as a human cannot possibly type the same 7 characters a millisecond apart over and over).  </TEXT>

Messages are more effective when they are focused. "Black lives matter" strikes a balance, being broad enough to be useful to many while being specific enough to address a particular topic powerfully. 

You can split hairs about the exact wording they should have used and the cost/benefit breakdown for different phrases, but the phrase as it stands is close enough to what the movement wanted to achieve: stop the police from getting away with killing minorities.

<TEXT>  On one hand there is the problem that (as far as I know, feel free to correct me), many developers are poorly paid for their time and are very stressed (for example at EA, but that might be an extreme).

Not true.

 The other problem is that I kind-of already have some experience in these other STEM fields and don't want to completely abandon them.

This is called the sunk cost fallacy. Forget about the past. Think about the future. What do you want to do? Then do that.

Don't go study chem. Either study one of those computer-related degrees at your uni, or go do your military thing. You don't necessarily need a degree - I don't have one. If you can show a potential employer that you made an app with hundreds of downloads, you're already doing better than most computer science graduates. </TEXT>

As for whether it's legal... IANAL. But the law consistently lags behind what technology is capable of. We still have laws that treat digital media as if it's the same thing as a physical object! So there might be some archaic laws that make it illegal. However, no-one is going to bother to sue you. Why would they? You're not selling anything, you're not claiming their work to be yours...

<TEXT> So first off, I would say your post title is misleading. When we talk about "efficiency", we mean code that executes fast   uses few resources - in other words, we're talking about _performance_. What you're asking is more about how to organise   structure your code.

---

_Structure_ your code. At the moment your main function does the following:

1. Fades in the console.
2. Sets up data (rooms, items, text, etc).
3. Creates helper functions.
4. Adds event listeners.
5. Runs the main game code.

This is incredibly confusing to read as there is no separation between one thing and the next. So the first quick win: break each of those sections out into a separate function, and in your main function, call those five functions in turn. Your main function should look something like this when you're done:

    $(document).ready(function() {
      displayConsole();
      initializeData();
      attachListeners();
      runGame();
    }

You don't actually need to make a function like this for your helpers - just declare your helpers before you call `$(document).ready()`.

---

You're currently making a bunch of variables like `strangeRoom`, `zombie`, `sword`, etc and just sticking them in the global namespace. There's a few issues with this.

Let's say you wanted multiple zombies. How would you achieve this? Would you just make `zombie1`, `zombie2`, `zombie3` etc? If so, how would your combat code look? You'd have to add code to every place that references a zombie to check for every single possible zombie variable... And if later in your game you choose to add a fourth zombie, you have to go back _again_ to every place that references your zombies and add an `if (zombie4)...`.

You've also probably noticed that adding a new room, item, etc requires a new set of branching `if` code to handle that object. What if you could just set up your game code once and then just add objects to extend your game?

To this end: put your game data - items, rooms, enemies, etc - into collections. You probably want a big ol' object that looks a bit like this:

    var gameData = {
      items: [
        {
          name: 'sword',
          combat: true,
          owned: false,
          // ...
        },
        {
          name: 'torch',
          combat: false,
          owned: false,
          // ...
        }
      ],
      enemies: [
        {
          name: 'zombie',
          // ...
        }
      ]
    }

Say you wanted to check how many enemies still live - you could just do `gameData.enemies.length`! Easy.

If you think along these lines, you should be able to see how you can start to re-write your game logic (all those `if`s) in a way so that they don't look up fixed conditions (`input == "open old door"    currentRoom == strangeRoom`), but rather dynamic ones (`input == room.input    room.accessibleRooms.indexOf(currentRoom) != -1`). And similarly, instead of executing fixed code, you execute code dynamically that you store in the game object.

---

An actual performance concern: the way your game code is currently structured, you are checking more than 30 `if` statements for every user input! Obviously, if `input == "look end table"`, it cannot also be true that `input == "look bookshelves"` - so why isn't it an `else if`?

Assuming you leave your input checks as they are, once you find a match (e.g. `input == "look barrel"`), you should `return` after executing the relevant code so that you don't run through several dozen `if`s that you already know will not be true.

---

Ultimately, for the current functionality, your core game code should be maybe... 20 lines? But you should have a bunch of game objects, each one with its own related game code to execute. Something like this:

    rooms: [
      {
        name: 'lounge',
        commands: [
          {
            input: 'look chair',
            result: function() {
              // do stuff
            }
          },
          {
            input: 'look end table',
            result: function() {
              // do stuff
            }
          }
          // ...
        ]
      }
    ]

My examples aren't great just because there's so much you could improve! But hopefully this gives you some idea of what you could do.

EDIT: I'm really glad this post is getting positive reactions, but I just thought I should reiterate: this is by no means an exhaustive guide to how you should structure code. I tried to give some useful, more or less standalone pointers. </TEXT>

Not everyone agrees with the idea of the "greater good". Libertarians believe in personal liberty above all else.

So if you can conceive of a way in which your organs have utility to you after death, then a libertarian view would say you have the right to hang on to them.

From the perspective of a libertarian, this is just. Penalising them for this by denying them organs during their lifetime is effectively imposing a political view on them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We strongly associate the sensation of mint with coolness   freshness. Naturally, toothpaste/mouthwash companies want you to feel fresh when you use their product, as that will make you trust it more - so they flavour it with mint.

Mint contains a compound that is sort of the opposite of capsaicin (found in chillies) - it tricks your body into thinking it is experiencing cold. </TEXT>

The short version is: every key is assigned to a specific finger, and you only ever hit that key with that finger. This lets your hands stay in basically one place, which in turn increases comfort and efficiency. And because you only have a small number of keys assigned to each finger, you don't have to look at the keyboard to type. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It sucks for the person disconnecting, but the person disconnecting is already going to try not to disconnect (by virtue of wanting to play the game), so players will self-minimise this risk.

But the short time is _great_ for the people who _don't_ disconnect. Honestly, one of the biggest reasons I stick with OW instead of going back to League or playing HotS is because it is so damn fast to get into a game. If the 10 second reconnect timer were, say, 30 seconds, it would chew into my enjoyment of the game a lot more.

There's also a statistical argument here: who's to say that lengthening the time from 10 seconds would significantly increase the percentage of successful reconnects? Maybe Blizzard looked at the data and found that the majority of successful reconnects happen within 10 seconds. If that is true, then lengthening the time helps almost no-one but hurts everyone who gets a leaver. </TEXT>

Outside of missions, there's a huge amount of stuff to do in terms of unlocking missions, crafting gear, configuring builds, making yourself look good, etc.

My favourite thing to do is defense missions. You have an object to defend, and enemies attack it in waves. Every 5 waves, you get a reward. I particularly enjoy doing these missions versus the Infested faction. I take my tanky Rhino frame, equip a giant two-handed sword, and spin2win. Never gets old. </TEXT>

If you wanted to see the data being sent, you'd need to use a tool like Wireshark to monitor network activity. And even then, how do you know when the keyboard would send its data? It could build it all up for six months and then send it at 3 am...

So the better option is to ensure it's not allowed. Check your firewall settings. There's an option to deny all network traffic until you explicitly allow it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  you nit-picked height lol, that was a vague example

No, it was a good example, because every comparable example you can think of boils down to being born with a different body.

 we dont have many Einsteins and not everybody becomes Elon Musk

Four reasons:

1. Not everyone wants to attain that goal. I have no interest in being a famous physicist or entrepreneur. My dreams lie elsewhere.
2. Not everyone who wants to attain that goal is willing to put in the work.
3. Not everyone who wants to attain that goal and is willing to put in the work has the means to do so. If you're born into poverty the odds are stacked against you. If your parents think science is a waste of a life then the odds are stacked against you.
4. Not everyone who attains lofty goals gets recognised for it. You mentioned Einstein and Musk. Do you think Einstein is necessarily the greatest physicist who ever lived? Or is he simply the best publicised physicist who ever lived? There is a difference between being the best and being seen as the best. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Are they "safe" to use? like can hackers steal your information from these? Are they able to do that?

Disclaimer: not an infosec guy, just a developer.

My instinct is that if this were possible, the device would have to be able to make network requests to send the stolen data to them. But keyboards can't make network requests. And even if it shows up as a USB hub with a connected keyboard   a network device, Windows (or whatever) would still probably pop up one of those firewall warnings where you have to explicitly grant access for the network request.

So, no, I doubt there's any risk. </TEXT>

So are you saying we can all go around using this word, and just hand out flyers to black people saying, "Don't worry, we're not using it as a racial slur"?

 Are you saying black people who use the N word around friends are racists? Because either it's a double standard, which is fucked up and wrong, or context is more important than the actual word used.

It's neither. They are effectively two different words. "Nigger" is what was used here. The version you're referring to is more commonly spelled "nigga", and can only be used by black people. I won't get into it, but there's loads of reading material around the interwebs. </TEXT>

 have seen a lot of athletes playing since childhood just to be eclipsed by a guy that started playing in their highschool years or so.

That's a very simplistic version of what I'm saying. High school guy may have grown up in a house that watches a lot of sports, or talks a lot of sports. Or maybe he pursued other skills early on that translate to effectiveness in a sport. That doesn't mean he has a magical football gene. </TEXT>

People say a lot of things that are not true. Talent scouts (in all fields) want to perpetuate the idea that some are inherently destined for greater heights than others, because otherwise they're out of a job.

And yes, some things can't be taught. That's because you learn them by experience.

 some people show these from a young age

<TEXT> I simply disagree. Different people are good at different things, but it's a matter of how much effort they put into it   how much they are exposed to it. An athlete's cap is a product of their body, not their innate "goodness" or predisposition towards running or jumping or whatever. Saying talent is a significant contributor to success is saying some people are just doomed to suck forever. I don't believe that is the case.

 While they know as well as others that talent got them there

Or perhaps the _perception_ of talent got them there. They got scouted because the scout "saw" talent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Firstly, you are in a tiny minority of players if you think he verges on being overpowered. I still get flamed in a decent percentage of games when I pick him. 

Secondly, everyone knows the "attack/defence/tank/support" categorisation is retarded. Symmetra is a DPS, Sombra is more of a support, Roadhog isn't really a tank, etc. So you can't make claims about what Junk should be based on his category. 

Look at his character design. Does he look like someone who cautiously sits far away from the action, or like someone who dives head first into trouble with no regard for his own safety? Hint: his passive is a suicide vest.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Not necessarily though. Some people are born with abilities that don't require work or special knowledge. They just know how to sing well or run fast. They have to work to refine those abilities, but you can't put all their success down to skill or knowledge. Some people are just incredibly good at a certain thing. That's what I would consider 'natural talent.'

So I think there's a subtle difference between having a body suited to a task, and what people mean by natural talent. The running example is an instance of the former. The singing example is more complicated: no-one is *innately* a good singer, it necessarily comes with practice, but some people have vocal tracts that fall squarely into the arbitrary set of properties that result in what we think of as a "pleasant" vocal timbre. That's still a function of the body! Confounding matters is that many of us sing throughout our lives, so the fact that we're practicing is masked. 

We don't say a guy with huge arms is "talented" at lifting stuff. We just say he's strong.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I'd like to ask if i should start with another (easier) functional language and if shifting from imperative languages to amazingly declarative ones like Haskell will make it harder for me to snap back into imperative programming when i need to?

Yes, I think you should start with an easier candidate such as a Lisp. Clojure for the Brave and True is an absolutely fantastic ebook that is aimed at people who can already program, just not in a functional way. It's also hilarious.

No, it won't make imperative programming hard for you. You'll just have a better set of tools available to you regardless of what paradigm you write in, and you will better understand engineering tradeoffs etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  But by removing Junk's self-harm, they essentially allow people to play him within melee range. 

Because Junkrat doesn't have the same strengths as Pharah.

 That will keep the characters playing how they're meant to be.

You're making a subtle error here, and the clue is in the phrase "how they're meant to be". "Meant" by whom? The only "meaning" that matters here is what the game designers choose. Junkrat used to hurt himself with his explosives, and as a consequence he was underpowered. Removing that factor was precisely the buff he needed to become a useful hero. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Talent, in my opinion, doesn't really exist - not in the way people talk about it. When people say someone is "talented", what they basically mean is that person is _magically_ better at something: they are innately better at it to start with (so when they start learning the skill, they will already be better than other beginners), and they will reach higher levels than anyone else is capable of (an untalented person will never be as good as a talented person no matter how hard he works).

Now, it is true that some people take to certain skills more easily, and reach greater heights with seemingly less hard work. This is not because of magic. This is because they have picked up skills and knowledge from related fields at some stage - even if only from reading about it.

So if you agree with me on all of the above, then it stands to reason that the single biggest determinant of whether you get good at something is whether you work hard at it and persist. Not whether you have a head start.

---

There's a second reason, which is that even if "talent" exists, then praising talent is like praising someone for being white or female. We generally feel as a society that we shouldn't praise people for inborn traits, as they have no control over these. But working hard - that's something you choose to do. </TEXT>

 A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

You don't have rights relative to a foreign state. You have rights relative to your own state. 

There are two possibilities: that this amendment was talking about defending against foreign armies, or defending against your own tyrannical government.

If it is the former: why need an amendment? If it's about defending against invasion, it's purely academic whether the gun belongs to you or your government. Why write a _logistical concern_ into the _Constitution_?

But in the latter case, it actually matters: it establishes an inalienable right.

<TEXT>  we haven't even considered how to go about the transitions since the game is likely to be made in 2D.

Why not make it in 3D? Unity for example makes it trivial to apply an isometric camera to a 3D scene, which if the camera is parallel or orthogonal to the floor looks like 2D. That then solves your transition problem: just rotate the camera.

Another idea occurs: what if you show both perspectives simultaneously, side by side (or over-under)? Perhaps you grey out the inactive perspective, but the player can evaluate the situation in both views at once.

 avoid turning the perspective changes into something that's purely reactive

I like your peers! :) This sounds tough, yes, but good design is not easy.

 does having two different styles seem like it'd be really confusing for the player?

Sorta. I think players will understand going in that they sort of have to learn two parallel ways of playing at once. However, I would caution against making the two modes _too_ different. I'm a huge believer in games like League of Legends, where you get like 3 or 4 abilities total, but you get massive freedom in combining them   exploiting their various effects. </TEXT>

Neither of those games use it as a combat mechanic though (as far as I can remember anyway). They use it more for puzzles   world traversal. I think using it for combat (i.e. in a time- and accuracy-sensitive way) will end up being quite stressful.

<TEXT> Something I don't think anyone else mentioned: in League there are multiple types of supports. IIRC in Smite only tanks get played as support; in League you get mage supports too, as well as "true" supports which are basically just heal/utility bots.

Also, you HAVE to last hit if you're not support - you get zero gold if you don't get the last hit. If you're support, don't fucking last hit unless you have Targon's. </TEXT>

You'd have to get a programmable 60% (DIY is an option) and add a trackpoint module. Not sure where to get those, but Massdrop had them once upon a time. 

 Also, anyone know of any cheap ($50 max) keyboards that are hardware programmable or can be converted/hacked somehow?

Anything can be hacked "somehow", it's about your resources (including patience). Take a random keyboard, cut the traces to the controller, put in your own controller, program away.  </TEXT>

Numpads force you into bad ergonomics. Having a numpad (whether you use it or not) puts strain on your wrists. 

 How are you going to type misc characters without a num pad?

My preferred method on Windows is the US International keyboard layout. It lets you type, for example, `^e` to make ``. On macOS it's a non-issue because macOS doesn't use the numpad for special characters anyway.  </TEXT>

Longsword is cheaper, which lets you get more pots, so you get hardcore sustain early on. It also lets you get a head start on items like ER.

Blade's life steal does not apply to spells, so if you're more of a caster ADC then Blade isn't as valuable to you.

You will lose all-ins with Longsword, though, as it doesn't give HP. </TEXT>

I mean mouse keys is a feature of the *keyboard*, not the operating system. As far as the computer is concerned, you're moving a real mouse around - not pressing keyboard keys. This means it works on most versions of most OSes, and you don't have to set it up on multiple machines, you just take your keyboard with you. 

 My area for my keyboard is big enough to hold a full size keyboard and still have about half the desk for mouse space as well so it isn't a bother for me.

This is not relevant. Your desk could be twenty feet wide and a full-size keyboard would *still* force bad ergonomics.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I think that we need to either open up new markets, or find some way of employing people, **or put into place regulations making it harder to automate things.**

You'd rather artificially hold back progress than accept the possibility of a different economic system? That seems like it goes so far beyond what is reasonable. You are so utterly opposed to the idea of communism that you'd rather effectively salt the earth than allow a communist economy.

 If there is such efficiency, but the average person does not have the money to buy things, then everything kind of falls apart.

So then why do we have to stick with "money" and "buying"? Why not say: shit, this old system we've been using no longer suits our needs, let's just give everyone what they need and use robots to do the majority of work?

 as social programs become ever bigger, there is an ever larger segment of people content to just exist. 

Source?

 If we have to widen the social safety net to the point where half the population is dependent on the other half, as with automation, things aren't going to work.

That's what taxes do: poorer people are dependent on richer people. The poor can't afford to have their roads paved, but the rich can afford to pay for it. I'd argue this system works pretty well.

 It's all well and good that the social safety net slowly expands and bit by bit, but when does it end?

It ends when everyone has what they need.

 At the end of the day, the only reason 99.9% of the population works is to put bread on the table.

This is a disingenuous way to put it. The only reason 99.9% of the population works is because **there is currently no other feasible way to put bread on the table**. We can make other ways, such as a universal basic income. What if putting bread on the table happened automagically? Can you prove that people would simply stop working altogether?

 If people had no drive to build a company, as they were perfectly content with their lives as they were, there would be greatly reduced innovation and discovery.

You know what is a pretty big barrier to innovation and discovery? Risk. I have tons of cool ideas every day of my life, but I don't follow through on them because I can't afford to pour tens of thousands of dollars into trying them out   then absorb the blow when they fail.

If my basic needs are met, I can afford to take much bigger risks. I can actually try out my crazy ideas. I can innovate more.

And I don't want this out of a desire for more money. I want this for innovation's sake. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My PC is old (2011) and was not powerful even when I bought it. Money is tight, but I can spare some change to upgrade the GPU though, which would make a huge difference to the games I like to play. 

The current GPU is a Radeon HD 6570. I am looking to get something more recent   powerful, but absolutely not a bleeding-edge card. Please bear in mind that I live in South Africa where PC parts are comparatively much more expensive, retailers tend to only stock best-known brands,   the used market is tiny. 

* Can I use any GPU that physically fits   uses only one PCIe slot? Or are there for instance "versions" of the PCIe bus? 
* I didn't make a point of getting a good PSU. How do I know how power-hungry a GPU will be? 
* I currently run Overwatch at 30 fps at my monitor's native 1440900, on minimal settings. Am I right to think a GPU upgrade will make a substantial difference? I would just like to get up to 60 fps and perhaps up the quality settings a bit. 
* Any particular GPUs I should keep an eye out for? 

Thanks  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  That is one of the benefits I wanted to list, but didn't. Yes, knowing how to socialize with people is a huge benefit, but it doesn't help you otherwise, I'd say.

??? What does this mean? "It's a huge benefit but it doesn't help you otherwise." ???

 Economics...I'm not even being taught that.

That's not the point. You said "most of the lessons will never help you". I am listing several examples of how different classes help you in life, to disprove this statement of yours. And your main CMV is "schools are useless". Again, I am disproving this. Whether you are taking subjects X, Y, or Z doesn't matter if every single subject is somehow useful in life.

 Uhh "history" means the past. I don't know what the ancient Egyptians have to do with Trump. 

I don't want to be mean, but I had to chuckle at this. "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." If you think Trump is any different to things that have happened a hundred times before, you clearly need to study history harder.

 On the other hand, those can be placed on another "school". A "school" for politics.

No, because then only people who want to become politicians will learn these things, and we as a society will be completely screwed because the general public will be unable to see how politicians are ruining the world. The _whole point_ of a political education is that _everyone_ needs to know this, otherwise we may as well live in a dictatorship.

 Um...depends on the teacher? My music teacher reads from the book we've got, and then tells us to fill out a sheet with answers. Yay! I enjoy music now! Oh wait, I already enjoyed classical music beforehand. This doesn't change my view on it whatsoever.

Can you prove to me that the majority of students have their appreciation of art increased by zero due to arts classes?

 So you want me to cheat and be dishonest? I have no problem with that, but you're also not changing my view. You're enforcing it here a little.

No, I'm not. Your view is "school doesn't teach me anything". I'm saying "school teaches you to cheat". "To cheat" is something.

 Let's just ignore this point since it's slightly irrelevant.

You don't get to ignore my points just because you think they're not relevant. Again: your view is "school is useless"/"school doesn't teach me anything worth knowing". Knowing that you prefer to work on your own is useful - for instance, it guides your choice of career.

 I hate that it's useless. Useless. I don't get paid for it. 

Money is not the only measure of value. Your education now will pay off in the future in the form of a better salary   better financial skills. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Another argument is that it prepares you for college/life. How does it do that exactly?

One way in which it achieves this is by exposing you to social situations (including conflicts) where you are not friends with all the participants. This forces you to learn how to function socially. But unlike a job, the stakes are much lower, and the adults are there to jump in if necessary (contrast to a job where a mismanaged social encounter can result in your termination).

 Memorizing facts that you can simply google nowadays is a complete waste of time.

But you don't. You could, but you don't. School provides a framework within which there are strong incentives to study the work.

I'm a great example of a person who struggles to study unless there's a direct, immediate, concrete reason to know the material.

 most of the lessons will never help you. 

I think this is trivial to disprove.

* Everyone needs to do maths from time to time: calculating interest, adding up expenses, etc.
* Learning a foreign language lets you converse in more countries, enjoy more literature/TV/films, have a deeper appreciation for holidays overseas, etc. (Not to mention it outright makes you smarter.)
* Economics   accounting help you with basic principles of budgeting, investing, etc.
* History   social sciences help you to understand what is happening in the world   make more informed decisions when voting in an election.
* Music   the arts allow you to more deeply enjoy media. They also let you participate in social activities such as community theatre, open mic, etc.

I could go on and on. 

The important thing here is that these things are hard to google. How do you google "better intuition for finance"? How do you google "better intuition for music"? Many school subjects focus on teaching you **skills**, which in part helps you to build an intuition for the subject.

 Problem is, I've been taking history, literature, art, etc classes for....years. I think I would've had the dream of becoming a historian a bit earlier on eh? 

It's going to be hilarious if you turn out to be a historian in a few years. :D Not really helpful, just a funny thought that occurred to me.

 I feel like you'd be called a more "cultured" or "knowledgeable" person if you knew all those things, but that's, once again, absolutely useless.

How can you say with a straight face that knowledge is useless??

I'm a software developer. I need to know how to program, but that's not all. I also need an understanding of the *problem domain* that I am working in. My previous job was building an HR/recruitment product; knowing more about HR   recruitment practices was directly helpful to my work. I currently work in air travel, and the more I know about air travel, the better my work. Having a solid generalist school grounding gives me a broad knowledge of many things so that no matter where I end up working, I have a better chance of at least knowing one or two things that benefit my work.

 I've read up about a 9 year old that performed surgery. I'm sure anyone taught to do that can do it as well.

If my surgeon is 9 years old I will tell the hospital in no uncertain terms to go fuck themselves.

 It teaches me to cheat for some extra grades.

So it teaches you that many large systems are imperfect and are ripe for disruption. It's showing you business opportunities.

 It teaches me to prefer working on my own for the most part since, at least a fair amount of the time, I do most of the work.

That's a helpful thing to learn.

 I guess it teaches you to "struggle"? I've had to memorize a language that I completely do not understand for 11 years. Currently, I'm simply just cheating any test related to this lesson. I simply can't memorize something in a different language that I do not understand, I simply gave up. I'm sure that's not the point a school would try to teach you is it?

Learning that sometimes you have to sit the fuck down, shut the fuck up, and just do this work you hate is a useful lesson. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm kind of sad Abyssal still has CDR on it, it would have been a great MR item for her otherwise. As things stand I don't want to drop IBG, SV, or Idol, so I'm already capped on CDR.

 with the active (+100% hp for 4sec) it could be usefull when really low... as you will have more missing hp but still the same %

Clever! So Gargoyle's active immediately before R-W gives you a huge healing buff then. Didn't think of that!

I think Gargoyle's is going to be great on her anyway, because (in my opinion anyway) a huge part of what makes tank Karma work is that people underestimate just how goddamn tanky she is. Having access to a passive   active that make her tankier the more people try to kill her will only increase this effect.

 And some AS rune as you spam aa and can be usefull to compensate the last nerf on her W (as it gives her 3 less sec CD reduction)

I've always taken AS reds on her, just too good for trading   last hitting, and makes IBG procs so much smoother to pull off especially late game. </TEXT>

Yes, but can every character make the _same_ difference in _every_ situation? Are you saying that Widow and Orisa and Lucio are the _exact same heroes_ with the _exact same abilities_?

Different situations call for different powers. If your team died   they're so spread out you can't rez them all, perhaps you'd rather rez Soldier and two tanks than Soldier   McCree and only one tank, so that you have two tanks alive that can contest the objective. Or perhaps the enemy team is low, so you rather rez the Genji or D.va who can finish them all off than the Widow who will struggle to wipe the enemy team if they just turtle up.

 This is only going to create diversity

Wrong word, "diversity" means "many different types of things". But I understand what you meant. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  there's an article that says there are compatibility and security problems with wireless keyboards

Security makes sense, for a few reasons. For your computer to accept the wireless connection, it must accept wireless connection. That means you are open to attacks over a wireless medium. And because of how wireless works, your keyboard must transmit everything it does in every direction, creating the potential for snooping.

Unless you work in a very security-oriented environment, I don't see this practically being an issue.

Compatibility on the other hand is more likely to cause problems. Wired keyboards all use the HID standard so they are essentially guaranteed to work with any modern OS. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's more nuanced than that, because at a restaurant your customers pay for the food, so it's in your best interest to source quality ingredients.

Restaurants manufacture the product, incurring expenses such as rent and ingredients, and the customer pays.

Websites manufacture the product, incurring expenses such as server costs, and the **advertiser** pays. So really, the advertiser is a closer analogue to the restaurant. </TEXT>

    At first:
    
          z
            o
    g
    
    Then Genji dashes:
    
        g
          z
            o

How does Orisa move in this situation to body-block for Zen?

 Thats when you stop shooting.

Then he walks away and comes back in a few seconds.

 But now he doesnt have the have the surprise factor and your team is more alert so they will be ready.

If your team is "ready" for that they are pulling their attention away from the front. That is why flankers are good: not because they get picks, but because they split focus. With your entire team turning around to focus Genji, Rein gets a free pin, marksmen get free headshots, Hanzo gets a free scatter, Zen gets free discords, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  As 'nerdy' as this sub is, howcome there aren't anyone, who build/customize for a keyboard like that?

So I have a theory about this.

There are three kinds of consumer:

* The kind who no longer wants a numpad or nav cluster at all, because they prefer the reduced hand movement of something like a 60% or ergo keyboard.
* The kind who wants a full-size keyboard because they are drinking the Kool Aid.
* The kind who wants something smaller than full size (perhaps they LAN a lot, perhaps they just get irritated with smacking the mouse into the keyboard in CS:GO, etc), but are not so "adventurous" to go with something far out like a 60%. These are the people you'd think would want a numpad in lieu of a nav cluster - but again, these are not very _adventurous_ consumers. They don't think too much about the standard keyboard layout. So in designing a keyboard for them, the simplest thing to do is just chop off the numpad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Haha, I was worried you were going to post Space Cadet!

So for your budget, you are not going to find anything right now that looks like that. Basically your best bet is going to be something like the KBP V80s we've been discussing with the cool vintage keycaps.

Once you have your keyboard, if you really want that true vintage aesthetic, you can save up some money to get aftermarket keycaps. You'll notice those Space Cadet keycaps have large, centered legends, and the top of the keycap is sort of a spherical indent rather than a cylindrical one (or flat top). Until recently, Signature Plastics (aka Pimp My Keyboard) was the only company manufacturing keycaps like that; recently, Chinese clones have popped up on Aliexpress and elsewhere. The search term you'll want to use is "SA" or "DSA"
 (those are the names of that spherical profile/shape).

Here's some examples of SP SA   DSA sets you might like:

* [Ice Cap](http://pimpmykeyboard.com/sa-ice-cap-keyset/) - in stock
* [Industrial](http://pimpmykeyboard.com/sa-industrial-keyset/) - sold out
* [Dolch](http://pimpmykeyboard.com/dsa-dolch-keycap-set/) - in stock
* [Granite](http://pimpmykeyboard.com/dsa-granite-keyset/) - sold out

Many of these can be found on the second hand market (/r/mechmarket).

You can make something even cooler if you are okay with blank keycaps - if you're a long-time typist this should not be a problem. </TEXT>

The person above you probably says not to take mid Karma alongside a utility jungler, because if that jungler comes to gank your lane, neither of you has the damage to blow up the enemy laner. But if it's a carry jungler, you can slow   root the target and let the jungler bring the damage. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No he is absolutely not a flanker. He can get back to the fight quickly, he can reposition quickly, he can heal himself, he has some burst, but he has nothing close to the backline access of Genji or Tracer, the only two true flankers in this game.

Just because someone can flank every now and then does not make them a flank_er_. Think about it like this: when we say Genji   Tracer are flankers, what we mean is they should spend the majority of their time flanking. Not pop around a corner to Helix-burst a Zen every now and then - 80% of the time they should not be with their team.

<TEXT>  Saying a guy is 'mansplaining' something is no different than saying a woman is 'bitching' about something.

No, *mainsplaining* is no different to saying a woman is "bitching" about something. Saying a woman is "bitching" is dismissing her opinions because she's a woman. **Mansplaining is dismissing a woman's opinions because she's a woman.**

 It's not inherently a feminist issue fyi. 

Yes it is. It is a gender equality issue and feminism is the name of the gender equality movement/philosophy.

 Because now you're involving people who are not identified as feminists and saying their opinion doesn't matter because of their genitalia. 

Uh... what? Are you saying feminism is only about gender equality *within the group of people who identify as feminists*? Next you'll be telling me that police brutality vs blacks is not inherently a race issue because it involves people who do not identify as racial equality activists.

Also, mansplaining is one form of saying someone's opinion doesn't matter because of their genitalia.

 Let me be VERY clear on this. I think men and women are equals.

Great! The word for this is "feminist".

 I and many others don't happen to have this issue, however, and maybe we'd like to be heard a bit instead of being told to shut up because we're 'mansplaining' facts that don't happen to suit the agenda of those who use the term.

I'm starting to see the issue: you thought OP's post was referring to you. Are you guilty of mansplaining? Do you habitually override the opinions of women around you? If not, then no, OP's post wasn't referring to you. Notice nowhere did he say, "**All men** do this." All he said was, "There exists a group of men who do this." Is that not true?

 from my perspective all the comments I got were just people getting upset that I feel nothing for this dude based on how interpreted his tweets.

Yes. That is the problem. This person made what boils down to a political argument, and you thought that gives you free reign to dismiss him as a person. "Your views differ from mine, therefore you are fundamentally bad and not deserving of pity when bad things happen to you. In fact, you deserve those bad things for being a bad person."

 Those are my own words there. What did I call his situation? HINT: It's the bold part.

That doesn't discount my statement. At first, you were sorry for him that he got screwed unfairly. Now, you are not sorry that he got screwed unfairly. You view it as a kind of punishment for a political view.

 I don't deal with liars.

Hahahaha

 DISMISSED.

Hahahaha

You don't actually want to debate. "I don't deal with liars" sounds like a line straight from The Donald's mouth. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Is it alright if I assume negative things of you and act on those negative thoughts every time you speak or do anything? 

No, because I am a specific person not guilty of the things you assume me to be guilty of. But OP did not have a list of names. He made a statement about a group of people that _does_ exist and _is_ guilty of the things he mentions.

Saying Barack Obama is a gangster is racist. Saying a disproportionate number of black Americans are gangsters is not.

 What I'm shocked by is how much you guys seem to care about the fact that I don't pity him based on how he treats others.

**He is not mistreating others. He is having a discussion about gender equality.**

 assuming the worst out of anyone who thinks mansplaining is in fact a sexist term. Which to my knowledge is only used against men to write off their opinions and concerns and never to actually further a conversation.

So then what do we do about the problem of men thinking they can explain everything to women? It's inherently a feminist issue. Having a word for it helps. It helps to highlight the gender inequities in the world. Fuck it, **I** do this all the time with my wife. It's a reflex. It's a real issue that needs to be addressed, and saying "we are not allowed to use the big scary word" doesn't promote healthy discussion.

---

TL;DR: you are extremely offended that you're not allowed to write this person off as a dick because of their political beliefs, but it is _you_ who does not want to engage in a real discussion - your immediate reaction to OP's feminist **argument** on Twitter was, "Oh he's a trash person, I'm glad Youtube fucked him over", not "Let's have a discussion about privilege." </TEXT>

<TEXT> So a full-size keyboard makes good ergonomics impossible. This is because it extends too far into the optimal area for your mouse. You then have to compromise: either you push the keyboard to the left, hurting your wrists when using the keyboard, or you push the mouse to the right, hurting your right wrist when using the mouse   reducing your freedom of movement. 

A small keyboard like a Pok3r does not have this problem at all. You have loads of space to use low sens while maintaining a comfortable position on the keyboard. And more comfort means more endurance, and higher precision. 

If you truly need a numpad (and you almost certainly don't), get a standalone one and put it on your left.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know Flask, but I know SQL. The way you define many-to-many relationships is using a third table, which is commonly called a "join table". This table will have `event_id` and `contact_id`. So if you have contact `123` and you want that contact to have events `45`, `67`, and `89`, you create three rows in the join table:

    | event_id | contact_id |
    | -------- | ---------- |
    | 45       | 123        |
    | 67       | 123        |
    | 89       | 123        |

So then if you want to find all the events belonging to contact `123`, you `JOIN` events with the join table, and then query the join table `WHERE contact_id = 123`. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  How do those switches feel versus brown/clear switches? Does the quiet tactile feel similar to browns, and the quiet click feel similar to blues?

*Broadly* speaking, the Quiet Click (aka Tactile) is tactile like Browns, and the Click is clicky like Blues. But they feel quite different. The Quiet Clicks are snappy as fuck! I've used Browns and felt they were more like dirty Reds - they go down a bit, then get a little scratchy (the "tactile" bit), and then go down again. By contrast, the Quiet Clicks feel like the tactility is right at the top, and it's very noticeable.

One thing I should caution you about: I've had my keyboard for less than a year and have had two switches break, and had to solder new ones in.

 Also, do they not have a lot of keyboards out there? I couldn't find anything that was close to what I was looking for with matias quiet switches.

Yeah, it's a bit of a rare thing. Mostly your options are Matias themselves (I don't like their keyboards), KBParadise, or custom builds.

Pretty sure the KBP V104 is close to your needs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The dominant reason is low production volumes. We are generally spoilt with electronics; most electronics we use are manufactured in massive quantities, leveraging economies of scale to drive the price down as low as it can possibly go. With our niche hobby, production volumes are much lower, especially when it comes to stuff like cool keycap sets and so on. So to a large extent you are paying a relatively high amount for the manufacturer's setup costs. </TEXT>

On the one hand, it's pure capitalism: you can't help it if the person who sold it to you set a lower price than they could. You are perfectly within your rights to snag it up and then sell it for higher.

On the other hand, I'm getting more and more anti-capitalist with every passing day. This way of living is not doing the world any favours. It particularly harms small niche communities like ours, where the free market breaks down a little. </TEXT>

You can run into conflicts, but this is no different to any other time you collaborate on a repo (i.e. if someone merges something into master that affects your work). </TEXT>

If killing the other service gets you 20% of its players back onto _your_ service, that's worth it. After all, by law, the IP belongs to you. Those laws exist to _reward_ the creation of IP.

 it's completely spitting in the face of players like me, who simply want to enjoy a product that we paid for, but is no longer officially supported.

Therefore the changeover to the automatic system **would not change the relative play rate of champs**. If your argument - that Vayne players are toxic - is correct, then the Vayne play rate should have stayed **the same**.

The fact that it changed points at a *different* cause. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  This is the company that shut down Vanilla World of Warcraft Private servers while also insisting nobody would ever want to play official vanilla servers.

Yes, because people playing on Vanilla servers are not playing on official servers. There's a direct conflict there. Vanilla servers substitute the actual good/service Blizzard is trying to sell.

Fan art, on the other hand, serves to get people more hyped about   invested in the game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand the hesitation, though I think you're wrong. It's not dependency, not really - if a few years later your keyboard breaks, you just shrug and go back to the shitty standard design. 

You seem to have realised that using the numpad is more comfortable for gaming. Very few people realise this, but it's a good insight! The idea with a split is essentially to make *all* your keyboard use more comfortable in precisely the same way. 

But if you're still not convinced, I'm sure others will make some good recommendations.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One way in which competitive team games get new players is by recommendations from friends. I am more likely to try a new game if I know I can play it with my brother. However, most competitive games place limits on the allowable Elo difference between teammates. 

Smurfing solves this by giving experienced players a way to get new people into the game. Growing the player base is almost always good. 

Therefore, there exist at least some situations where smurfing is good for the community.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Could believe that this game has a memory leak issue. With amount of bugs/issues this game has launched with, it doesn't inspire a lot of confidence in their QA to catch something like a memory leak.

Not just that, memory leaks are pretty hard to catch in the first place unless you set up test cases specifically for that.

Anecdotally (again), crashes seem to happen during busy moments (lots of fire, abilities, enemies) rather than quiet ones (I don't think we've had a single crash during a quiet moment).

 Have a hard time believing that it could persist through the game crashing to the "desktop". It would be pretty crazy if the PS4's OS allowed memory to remain allocated to a game that is no longer running.

Eh, maybe some kind of zombie process or something? I don't know enough about the PS4. We're just going on experience here. </TEXT>

If you are affected by these crashes, try restarting after every couple games - see if that helps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh man, trackballs are the best. The thing they're really great at is letting you do both huge movements (e.g. when you have like 3 monitors side by side and want to go from one side all the way to the other in one movement), and small precise movements. Many computer users (gamers especially) turn off mouse acceleration for better control with a mouse, but a trackball actually benefits from really high acceleration. Plus, spinning a smooth, heavy ball feels really good compared to rubbing a trackpad.

If you have the cash, I'd go for the Tex Yoda, it's perfect for mobile use (depending on your definition of "mobile"). </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Could you recommend any good mechanical keyboard for massive typing (cherry mx blue?) with an integrated touchpad?

Would you consider other pointing devices? There's the Tex Yoda with a built-in trackpoint (the old red "nipple mouse" that IBM/Lenovo laptops have): http://www.kbdist.com/shop/tex-yoda

There's also the Ultimate Hacking Keyboard which has a trackpoint module, and I think a trackball module too: https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/

I can vouch for trackballs, they're wonderful to use. I don't know if you have some kind of disability or other issue, but even if you don't have a hand I suspect a trackball might be great for you.

 I saw a few keyboards with touchpads, but they are mostly for gaming, not programming (that's what I do 95% of the time).

There's no difference (except that "gaming" brands are often more expensive than they should be due to bullshit like RGB lighting). </TEXT>

Instead of 2 waves + objective, 2 waves + objective, extract, you have a more "quest-like" structure where your mission might be to, say, free some hostages and get them to extraction. Many different planets, amazingly convoluted   mysterious lore with a very unique flavour, and tons of weapons. And fashion.

<TEXT> * It's the only (I think?) 60% Topre keyboard.
* There is a really lovely design philosophy behind it (https://www.keychatter.com/2015/07/31/the-saddle-of-the-horse-community-interview-with-professor-eiiti-wada-creator-of-the-hhkb/).
* It has some awesome default features, like having Ctrl where Caps Lock normally goes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So the reason people want Blues is twofold. Firstly, they are the most tactile of the Cherry-style switches, by far. They have a little clicky noisemaker mechanism that just feels fantastic.

The second reason is the sound they make is really satisfying while typing.

Browns don't have the noisemaker (so the only noise they make is "natural", e.g. due to bottoming out the keycap), but they are also not as tactile-feeling.

So long story short, it's up to your completely subjective preference. :D

If your room doesn't have fantastic sound isolation, and you are going to be up late at night, then I would say go with Browns. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I suspect it has something to do with the lack of "buddy system" in Overwatch. In League, the support is tied to the bot lane, and is forced to babysit one player for the majority of the game - and that one player is usually the weakest for the majority of the game, only coming into their own after 3+ items. So not only do you have to sit and work with one player most of the time, but it's a boring lane too.

In Overwatch, the support has more freedom to affect the whole team, not just one player. And your job isn't to babysit, your job is to help in the fight. You're not trying to avoid fights, you're trying to win them. </TEXT>

Customs stuff for me was about R300, bringing the total to R2300. I don't think it matters where you import from, it matters what you import. Since we don't really manufacture computers in this country, there's no huge markup for something like a keyboard. Compare to textiles, where you easily end up paying R700 for a T-shirt that costs R300. </TEXT>

In my opinion, Gateron is the way to go unless you want to go real low-budget on your first buy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  If each damage boost adds on to the one already in effect

 If they just add what they would to base damage

The generally accepted terminology for these two types of combination are "multiplicative" and "additive" respectively. "Multiplicative" means all the boosts multiply each other - so two 50% damage boosts give you 1.5 * 1.5 = 2.25x damage.

"Additive" means the boosts add together - so two 50% damage boosts give you 1 (base) + 0.5 + 0.5 = 2x damage. </TEXT>

Like... 6/10 is not _bad_. That is still, on average, better than other games. A game that is rated above 50% on a rating scale is, on balance, good, unless you apply some weird logic about only _truly great_ games being allowed to be called "good". </TEXT>

<TEXT> So both pre- and post-1.05, we have had this problem on our PS4 (two different EA accounts playing the same copy). We get frequent bluescreen crashes during multiplayer. It seems to happen at random. We've messaged other players from our team and they say their games didn't crash, so it must be localised. What on earth can we do?

Also, we get pretty atrocious latency (feels like 300ms+) being in South Africa. What can we do to improve it? With client-server games like Overwatch, League etc I usually get ~180ms pretty consistently playing on EU servers. Would it help to only queue up with players in Africa   EU? Any suggestions on how to find them? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Number pads are great for business documents. When doing my invoices, taxes, bills, etc. the number pad saves a lot of time. You just have to use it enough to get used to it.

This is a common argument, but it's misguided, and you give the reason away right at the end - it saves time _if you learn it_. If you spend that same time learning the number row, you can be just as fast. But because the numpad exists, people assume it must be faster/more efficient - so they take the time to learn it, and then end up in a self-fulfilling prophecy.

 I have an older laptop that has mechanical keys 

Whoah, are you sure? Laptops with mechanical keyboards are _incredibly_ rare.

 There are some awesome builds in here. I do wordworking so making a board out of wood interest me.

Yeah, a lot of people get wood cases! It can look quite lovely, especially if you have nice understated keycaps like DSA Granite or DSA Quartz. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For exactly the reason I gave. :) It makes no sense to assign an entire key to your two best fingers, so some of us have keyboards which assign a _bunch_ of keys to the thumbs, only one of which is Space. As you can guess, there's no electronic reason for the Space key to be so fucking huge. And because of reasons, we can't always get a keycap (the bit that the letter is printed on) that is small like a letter key but says "Space" on it, so often the keys are mislabelled. </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Ha haa! You have activated my trap card!*

* The standard layout is _terrible_. Our fingers are not made to move side to side - why the staggered key rows? Why assign only one key to our _two_ strongest, most agile fingers (thumbs)? Why put Caps Lock in such a convenient position, yet put Ctrl so far away?
* The whole numpad thing. Numpads are useless, and they force bad ergonomics. At least put the damn thing on the left so it can be ergonomic!
* The switches. Mechanical keyboards feel good to type on. Going back to a standard keyboard feels _terrible_.
* Many keyboards only allow 2-key rollover - if you try any fancy combo in a fighting game, you are going to have a bad time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't have one, but I'm sure it's easy.

Do note that the Ergodox EZ I linked is just one iteration of the Ergodox - there's other people (like this guy http://shop.profetkeyboards.com/) who build Ergodoxes too, and they may offer more customisation.

My thoughts on the two:

* Many have complained that the Ergodox thumb cluster is a bit awkward. It's too far away from the home row, so you can only realistically reach the innermost thumb key without stretching. There have also been complaints that it's hard to pick out the key you want with the thumb because there's so many of them. By contrast, the Diverge only has three keys per thumb cluster, and they are arranged much more comfortably. (The original Diverge was actually designed specifically to address /u/blahlicus's grievances with the Ergodox design.)
* The Diverge can be kitted out with a normal keycap set; the Ergodox requires a special set due to its overuse of 1.5u (I think?) keycaps.
* The Ergodox EZ can be had with a tenting kit, allowing you to angle the sides for optimal comfort. No such option exists for the Diverge AFAIK.
* The Diverge is cheaper.

I've put a lot of thought into getting a split keyboard, and I'm confident a Diverge would sort me out nicely for work on macOS and Windows, and gaming on Windows. Protip: use the left thumb for Alt, Shift, and Space. Put Ctrl where Caps Lock would normally go. Put Super (Windows) where Shift would normally go. Caveat: untested. </TEXT>

Why do it this way, though? Why not just kill the monster immediately when the packet comes in? You can keep a log of what the monster did in the last n time (e.g. dealt 2 damage to me), and if a network packet comes in saying "actually this monster died before it dealt that damage", you kill the monster immediately and undo the damage it did. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Are you talking about switching to dvorak, curving the board, splitting the board, or something in those realms or am I being dense?

Very much that sort of thing!

I'm not personally a huge believer in alternate layouts (Dvorak et al), mostly because I haven't given them a try. My biggest reason for this is compatibility - using another computer is going to be very hard if I can't ensure I always have my chosen layout available there. Luckily, this is a thing you can completely solve in software alone, so it doesn't affect your build plan.

Mostly, I'm talking about these points:

* Alignment of keys with respect to your body - wrists, arms, shoulders, etc.
* Using your strongest, most agile fingers more.

# Key alignment

Your fingers are not great at moving side to side! The staggered horizontal rows of the standard keyboard are a relic of typewriter design - the rows had to be staggered so that there was space for the mechanical arms to move past each other.

No such requirement exists today, so there's no reason to stagger rows horizontally.

You may want to stagger rows vertically, as e.g. your middle finger is longer than your pinky. Look to e.g. the Ergodox for an example of how this is done.

Also, the standard keyboard layout forces your wrists to bend a lot. This is bad! A better solution is a curved/angled layout, like the MS Ergo or Atreus, or even better, split the keyboard into two halves, like the aforementioned Ergodox.

# Using your best fingers

Your thumbs are super strong and agile! **Why are you putting them both on a single key?!**

To anyone who takes comfort   efficiency at all seriously, I would not recommend anything less than 2 keys per thumb, but preferably more. (I personally think 3 is optimal.) Use them for modifiers! If you put Shift on a thumb key, you can type capital letters so much more easily, because you never have to use a pinky to do it - so in turn you only need one Shift key, and you don't have to either stretch when using one hand for both, or do that awkward thing of Shift with one hand and the letter with the other.

If you're a gamer, having a solid 2-3+ keys on the left thumb is so great. That's effectively what those Orbweavers and similar gamepad devices do. </TEXT>

Pain is one of the hardest symptoms to deal with, because it cannot be measured or detected by the doctor. If by "never help" you mean they don't suggest ways to mitigate, or prescribe painkillers, then I think you're lying. If by "never help" you mean they don't wave their magic wands and remove your pain, that's because they can't.

<TEXT> If you want to fix it, open it up and see if the solder joint is looking okay. Maybe poke at it with a multimeter. It might be the solder joint wearing out, or the switch may be broken. Either way, a fix is easy if you have a soldering iron.

The upgrade for the TK is the newer Masterkeys Pro M. Same form factor, but a standard layout, and RGB lighting.

If you want to make a keyboard, there's tons of resources. Google 'brownfox build guide' - it's a forum thread on Deskthority where the designer of the Whitefox details how he built a keyboard. You can trivially emulate the numpad/arrow switching that the TK does if you build your own - people use open-source firmware (usually TMK/QMK) with a Teensy microcontroller, and that is completely programmable to your liking. It's usually a bit more expensive than buying a mass-produced product like a CM keyboard, but you get something that suits your needs more closely.

If you're going to go the DIY route, I'd advise you to think hard about every aspect of your keyboard, including things like layout. The standard keyboard we all know is horribly designed for its current purpose (computer use). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Idk, picked it up somewhere.

So a recursive function breaks a problem into smaller and smaller bits until it finds a bit it can actually handle. Then it handles that small bit, and combines it with all the other small bits to create the final result.

That "bit it can actually handle" is called the base case. </TEXT>

<TEXT> git is a tool you use to track changes to files. It lets you go back to earlier versions. It also lets you do things like branch your files off into a new "version" that you can work on independently of the main "version", and then later merge the two "versions" together. It also acts as a kinda-sorta backup tool, in the sense that if you delete a file by accident, you can just tell git to "forget" that you deleted it. The big thing about git is that it works over a network. I have a copy of the git project, and you have a copy, and we can sync our changes to each other.

Github is a website that hosts a copy of a git project. Many people use it as a "master" copy, so everyone working on a set of files gets it from Github, and pushes their changes to Github. </TEXT>

There is really one reason: comfort   efficiency. A keyboard is like a saddle: it is the part (well, one of the parts) of the system that your body interacts with.

The difference between mechanical keyboards and membrane keyboards is simply this: mechanical keyboards are made to be good keyboards, at the cost of being expensive. Membrane keyboards are made to be cheap, at the cost of being good keyboards. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be clear, what do you mean by "test each piece as you write it"? Do you mean write tests for it during/after writing the code, or do you mean manually test it?

If the former: that is the same thing as unit testing. The "better practice" you may have heard of is _test-driven development_, which means that you write tests **before** you write code. You decide up front, "This function must take two integers and return an integer, and it must throw an error if either argument is not an integer, and it must throw an error if the second argument is zero." And then you write a test asserting all that, and _then_ you write the code that will make the test pass. A lot of people give up on writing code like this because it's a fucking hassle, and because it means you must know up front what every bit of code will do; often in practice your requirements change as you code.

If the latter: unit tests are not just for _now_, they are for _later_ too. Sure, you can test your function `foo()` as you write it. But then three months later, you are working on a seemingly-unrelated thing... and you change something that makes `foo()` break. You now have to manually discover and track down the error. You might not even discover it because why would you be looking at `foo()`? So you end up deploying the code to live, and two hours later the emails from users come streaming in. If you have unit tests covering as much as possible of your code, this can never happen - you just run the full suite of tests on everything whenever you change something, and if all the tests pass you know with 99% certainty you didn't break something. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your first assertion is not accurate. Your base case must be an answer to the simplest question of its type. For instance, if your function is to yield the factorial of an integer, your base case should be the factorial of 1. That has nothing to do with the form of the ultimate answer, because before you can get the ultimate answer, the iteration of the function calling the simplest case must *assemble* the result of the simplest case into its own result - in this case, it has to multiply the return value by 2 and return the result of that.  </TEXT>

Your app talks to the back end. It simply says, "Please do `db_query_foo()`." The back end makes the actual requests to the DB. So your app doesn't need the DB credentials. 

Since your DB credentials are on a server somewhere, they can only be accessed if someone breaks into the server. Decompiling the app wouldn't tell them anything.  </TEXT>

Oh my glob. You're telling me a person who only plays one hero thinks that hero is strong?? This is amazing! I thought all one-tricks try to main weak heroes.

 He is NOT squishy, as he has the second-highest effective health in the game- that is, 900 to Winston's 1000 when ulting.

This is a highly disingenuous comparison. Winston has 1499 effective health, if he waits to 1 HP to ult. Roadhog has 900 effective health if he heals, **but his heal takes a long time, during which you can shoot the crap out of him**. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Any ideas for a carrying solution for my office RFID tag? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-24 15:15:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a little passive RFID tag that unlocks the front door at the office. (I'll describe it as I don't want an image link to be interpreted as breaking rule 1 lol.) It's rectangular, about 2cm by 4.5cm, maybe 5mm at its thickest. It has a small oval hole (maybe 2mm by 3mm) on the one end.

I despise carrying small things like this loose in my pockets (I already dislike carrying small change), and I don't want to stick the tag in my backpack because I need it to be easily accessible.

My current EDC is just my phone, apartment keys (disgusting big thing with an ugly-ass gate remote, but what can you do), and a quickdraw-style wallet. The tag is too thick to go in the wallet. I don't want to tie the tag to the keys because I have a separate system for carrying my keys.

What clever solutions can you come up with for carrying this thing around?

My best idea so far is to put a loop of string or whatever through it, and tuck the string into the wallet so it sort of hangs off the wallet. V informal though. My wallet isn't the kind with a band, so I can't tie it to there.

I could do something lame like carry it on a carabiner on a belt loop, but I am not a late 80s dad.

EDIT: Unintentional German

EDIT: I suppose my issues can be summarised as: it's a small, loose item in my pocket, which makes it hard to locate and easy to lose; it also increases the number of items I have to remember to shove in my pockets by 1. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Convince me to use Clojure over Elixir. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-25 11:19:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've got a client-server project that I want to write in a functional style (as a learning exercise, and because I think functional is the future). It will require high concurrency and reliability.

In short, Clojure and Elixir both fit the brief.

I have never worked with either language. I've read part of Clojure for the Brave and True and experimented lightly in the REPL; my Elixir experience is similar. I have some Java experience but no Erlang experience.

Here are some reasons I would choose Elixir:

* Ruby-like syntax is more familiar to me, having never used a Lisp before.
* Pattern matching seems like an incredibly powerful construct.
* BEAM's fault tolerance ("let it crash") is second to none.
* The Actor model seems very easy to grok, from my limited contact with it. I like that there is a canon model for concurrency.
* Concurrency is essentially free.
* Elixir only infrequently lets the Erlang layer poke through.

Convince me that Clojure is a better fit! </TEXT>

<TEXT> In Rails, for example, we manage dependencies in a Gemfile which will at build time retrieve all the various libs from wherever they are hosted.

Why is this a good thing? Why do we not like checking our libraries into version control?

Arguments for:

* We can allow the system to pull the most recent version (or e.g. the most recent minor version), thereby ensuring availability of bugfixes.

Arguments against:

* npmgate. If the library ever gets taken offline, our application will break at build time.
* We can't easily tweak the library locally. (Ruby for example solves this by making monkey patching a thing, though it's still hard to inspect the library source.) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Struggling to put words to one of my favourite game design tropes </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-21 21:31:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There is a feature (or mechanic or trope) that appears in many of my favourite games. It is something so powerful to me that I want to find the words to discuss, interrogate, and analyse it, but I'm drawing a complete blank.

Games which feature this trope:

* Soulsborne games
* Hoplite (Android puzzle roguelite)
* Hyper Light Drifter
* League of Legends

The basic idea is that your character only has access to a limited set of tools or moves at any point (the sweet spot seems to be 3-8). Each of these tools has a simple set of rules that defines it. Crucially, those tools can be combined in incredibly expressive ways.

Think of all the ridiculous combos Lee Sin can pull off in League with only his Q, W, R, and a trinket. Or all the clever attacks you can mount in Dark Souls with a sword and a shield.

Is there even a name for this? Am I being stupid? Is what I'm talking about just "good design"? </TEXT>

They have the precision   speed/"dynamic range" of a mouse (because you're moving a massive object), but they can scroll infinitely in either direction.

They are not limited by the size of your desk. They play well with acceleration and multiple monitors. And they're so comfortable to use.

<DATE> 2016-11-07 09:47:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Heyoo

Before I left work for a week to go get married (woohoo), I ordered a Logitech Trackman Marble as I found a local seller selling them for dirt cheap. This morning I was able to plug it in for the first time and do a little work.

Thoughts so far:

* The ball doesn't move as smoothly as I'd hoped. I suppose what I imagined was a very heavy ball with loads of inertia, that could spin for several seconds if given the initial push. In practice it does have inertia but it comes to a stop quite quickly. I imagine that high-end trackballs like the CSTs behave more like I expect.
* It's incredibly comfortable. The weird alien shape is just so nice to rest my hand on.
* My wrist feels so much better. It's early still, but I suspect this will remain true.
* The big side buttons are really comfy to use. The little ones not so much, but they're not exactly horrid. I found the side buttons on my Sensei Raw to be similarly lame at first, and I got used to them just fine.
* macOS doesn't recognise the back/forward button functionality out of the box.
* The lack of scrolling was a problem. My solution (which I'm very happy with) was to install Logitech Control Center to bind the left small button to middle mouse click, and then use Smart Scroll to interpret the middle mouse click as a scroll action. At first I tried the vector scroll mode (as seen in Firefox), figuring it would be nice to hit the button and then release it until I'm ready to stop scrolling; however, I soon realised I scroll quite a lot, so I changed to grab scroll mode, where you hold down the middle mouse button in order to scroll. Smart Scroll is set to completely consume the middle mouse click - otherwise various apps interpret it as a click still, which is super annoying. Scrolling in this fashion is very, very nice! I kind of wish I had a trackball in my audio days... (EDIT: https://github.com/Seelge/TrackballScroll is a nice alternative for Windows.)
* Small movements are tricky. It takes quite a bit of force to get the ball to start moving from rest.
* The Logitech Control Center software is great for setting the sensitivity - I could leave my OS-level mouse sensitivity where it was, and just use the LCC multiplier to get the trackball sensitivity up to a decent point. My system mouse sensitivity is about 40% of maximum, and LCC is set to a 3x multiplier. Works pretty okay so far.
* I'm wondering whether I need more acceleration. Hard to tell.

Verdict: fuckin stoked I dropped R200 on this bad boi

UPDATE: I've dropped the sensitivity modifier to 2x and it feels way better now. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-10-24 14:26:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So the trackpads on Macs as of a couple years ago have inertial scrolling: if you start scrolling and release the trackpad during the movement, the page keeps scrolling as if the input device has inertia.

I'm looking for a utility that will allow me to get this behaviour on normal mouse movement as well. As seen here, Windows can achieve this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQE3GWSZvKU

Anyone know of such a utility? I post this here because basically what I want is a "trackball simulator" for my trackpad. This is partially an attempt to discover whether trackball-style movement suits me, before dropping the cash on one (I live in South Africa - gadgets are pricier here).

From what I understand, the Steam Controller has such a mode for its trackpad(s) and it's explicitly called a "trackball mode" in the settings. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [help] How do I fix this broken switch? KBP V60 Matias </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-24 09:08:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My KBP V60's X keyswitch broke. The taller of the two electrical contacts snapped off near the top. 

I've managed to open up the keyboard to the point of removing the plate-PCB assembly from the case. 

I assumed initially that I'd be able to desolder only the broken switch and pop it out of the top of the plate. However, it seems now that the switch housing locks into the plate from both directions - a set of flanges hold it in place from the bottom, and then a latch holds it in place from the top. 

This makes me believe that the only way to remove the whole switch is to desolder EVERY switch. Is this correct? 

If so, I'm a little worried about attempting this. My soldering skills are not the best, and I'm worried that desoldering 60-odd switches runs a big risk of damaging the circuit somewhere (damaging traces, burning out the controller, etc).

I did have another idea: it seems like the switch contacts just poke through the bottom of the switch housing to become the switch pins. Could I desolder only the broken contact's pin, pull the contact out through the top of the plate, and then open up a spare switch, steal its contact, and solder it into the switch from the top?  </TEXT>

If you are duelling a Karma and you realise she's holding on to her ult and W, she's trying to bait you - she will heal at the last possible second, getting back ~40% of her max HP. (Do you have vision of her jungler...?) This ability is a big part of what makes tank Karma so goddamn tanky.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> 2003 VW Polo vibrating at idle </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-03 09:52:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My 2003 VW Polo (manual) started acting up on Tuesday morning. I'd gotten a flat tyre over the weekend, so on Monday morning I had it fixed and put back on.

On Tuesday morning, when I started my car, I felt it vibrating. This is not a high-frequency vibration like you expect - this is low frequency, more like *shaking*.

I find I have to rev the car more than usual for a given gear, else it feels like the engine is about to cut out. Acceleration is also much poorer than it normally is.

If I rev up a lot, the vibration gets a little less noticeable. (EDIT: Vibration persists during driving if revs are low.)

Any ideas? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't really play League any more due to my living situation, so I'm looking for something to plug the gap.

Requirements:

* It can't control like League/Diablo. In other words, no spamming right click every few milliseconds. This probably means WASD + mouse.
* My machine is a bit of a potato. Can play Mass Effect 3 on full settings and get 60 fps.
* I want an official, in-client ranked ladder to climb.

Preferences:

* I don't have the basic skillset for FPS games, nor do I care much for games that are won by mechanics. I prefer decision-making (hence why I love League).
* I love games that look beautiful. I can appreciate different aesthetics though.
* I LOVE LOVE LOVE games that have a huge roster of colourful characters. (So that I can main the weird one no-one likes.)

Things I've sort of looked at:

* Smite is probably good but the game is so ugly. :(
* TF2 doesn't really grab me with its limited scope for customising your loadout/character. I did kind of enjoy the Overwatch open beta though so maybe?
* Paragon looks fucking baller but I doubt I can run it. (Radeon HD 6570 is much lower in terms of 3D Mark than the lowest graphics card they currently support.) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm interested in top lane tank Karma in particular. It's my current freelo build/role, but I worry that the added CDR on Abyssal is going to break my normal build of RoA, FH, SV, Lucidity. It's going to be especially hard to get enough MR *and* enough CDR vs teams that have significant damage in both AD and AP... Not to mention that many of those items are getting nerfed. 

Anyway, thoughts? Feel free to discuss other lanes and builds as well. 

EDIT: One idea that could probably work is to go SV into Lucidity for 20% CDR, then grab a different HP+AP item in lieu of RoA (e.g. Liandry's), and then get FH/IBG for the CDR cap... Or something. Mana might struggle. 

EDIT 2: New RoA into SV is broken. </TEXT>

I want something I can roll up (as I will carry it to work as well), and I want something with stitched edges (my QCK Mini is already plenty frayed after ~18 months). I don't want something wider than 70cm or narrower than, say, 55cm. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-03-30 14:19:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm looking for the title of a science fiction slash dystopian book I saw in a bookstore in South Africa within the years 2010-2013. It was a new release at the time, and possibly the debut novel by its author.

The cover was pink and grey. The blurb described a situation very similar to that of Nine Inch Nails's Year Zero concept album: surveillance state, new designer drug taking the world by storm, people across the globe having weird, possibly religious visions (possibly including hearing the Voice of God).

I looked up the author at the time. There was very little info on him, but I did find his LinkedIn page, which stated that his previous writing work was predominantly in video games (not extremely popular ones though). Pretty sure the author was English, though I suppose he could be American or Canadian. I think his first name is some variation on Christopher. </TEXT>

<TITLE> First-time phalaenopsis owner, really confused about liquid orchid food. </TITLE>

<TEXT> So we grabbed an orchid from Woolworths today, along with this: http://www.woolworths.co.za/store/prod/Food/Flowers-Plants/Accessories-Bulbs-Seeds/Orchid-Concentrate-Plant-Food-250ml/_/A-6001009959034

The orchid came with a tag recommending you water it by placing a few ice cubes at the base of the plant (1x/wk in summer, 1x/2wk in winter). It also said to "feed" every two weeks.

The orchid food bottle says to dilute it 5ml to 1l of water, and to feed every two weeks.

So you can see how this is confusing. One thing says "give it like no water at all", the other says "oh it's fine just submerge the whole goddamn thing".

What am I supposed to do here?

On a related note: every article about "beginner orchid care" etc (including the one linked in the sidebar) fails to explain how to feed the plant, so some advice here is appreciated. </TEXT>

<TITLE> In-depth mastery discussion w.r.t. Varus ADC </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-10 14:30:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm looking over the mastery trees and trying to decide on a good setup for Varus. One of the things that's jumping out at me about masteries in their current state is that so many of them are just point dumps; no matter which champion I play, I find about half of the masteries are only there because I need them to reach a higher tier.

So I want to take an objective look at each and every mastery and see if we can decide on which ones actually *matter*, so I can decide which tiers in which trees are worth keeping.

# Ferocity

## Tier 1

* Fury: great
* Sorcery(?): average (though better than for most ADCs, given Varus's high ability damage)

## Tier 2

* Double Edged Sword: bad (in my opinion - ADCs are squishy enough without you debuffing yourself)
* Feast: good (boost for laning)

## Tier 3

* Vampirism: excellent (free sustain! What's not to love?)
* Natural Talent: garbage (less than 1 AD   AP per level? Seriously? If this gave a tangible quantity, it could be good on Varus given W   R)

## Tier 4

* Bounty Hunter: average (good damage, but risky)
* Oppressor: great (most supports bring CC, and Varus has his E   R)

## Tier 5

* Battering Blows: great
* Piercing Thoughts: garbage

## Tier 6

* Warlord's Bloodlust: bad (given how much of Varus's damage is loaded into his spells)
* Fervor of Battle: average/good/great (haven't tested the changes yet. With Q and E, Varus can build fast stacks, but because much of his damage is in his spells, the benefits aren't huge)
* Deathfire Touch: bad (zero synergy)

# Cunning

## Tier 1

* Wanderer: garbage
* Savagery: great (easier last hitting)

## Tier 2

* Runic Affinity: average (no guarantee that you can routinely secure buffs)
* Secret Stash: good (requires you to buy pots, which have become expensive)

## Tier 3

* Merciless: great (general damage buff, good for cleanup)
* Meditation: average/good (Varus is mana-hungry, after all)

## Tier 4

* Bandit: bad (get less than half of the benefit due to being ranged   farming)
* Dangerous Game: great

## Tier 5

* Precision: great
* Intelligence: great

## Tier 6

* Stormraider's Surge: average/good/great (**if** you can trigger it, the MS is a huge boon to kiting)
* Thunderlord's Decree: excellent (suits Varus's trading pattern)
* Windspeaker's Blessing: garbage

# Resolve

## Tier 1

* Recovery: average/good (free sustain!)
* Unyielding: garbage

## Tier 2

* Explorer: garbage
* Tough Skin: good/great (Varus likes to trade)

## Tier 3

* Runic Armor: great (benefits not only lifesteal/vamp which Varus will build, but any shields   heals from supports, including Relic proc)
* Veteran's Scars: good

## Tier 4

* Insight: good (having Flash and Heal/Ghost more frequently is a huge boon for an aggressive Varus)
* Perseverance: good (free sustain!)

## Tier 5

* Swiftness: good (kite like a god)
* Legendary Guardian: good (flat armour/MR means a lot when you have almost none)

## Tier 6

* Grasp of the Undying: garbage (due to low health pool   being ranged)
* Strength of the Ages: bad
* Bond of Stone: hahahaha

<TEXT> I have a ~1952 Gibson L-48 with a P90 sitting untouched at my parents' house. It's in bad shape: it spent most of the last five decades sitting in a closet in the Kalahari desert. The finish is cracked and worn, the frets are all worn down, the tuner knobs are crumbling, metal is rusty, etc.

I'm in desperate need of cash, so I want to sell this on to someone who can actually (1) restore it and (2) play it.

What I'm not sure about is how much to ask for it. I see these guitars go for around $3k restored, so what's a fair percentage of that to ask for unrestored? I'm sure the restoration would be expensive so I want to arrive at a price that's fair to both myself and the buyer. </TEXT>

So: what exactly is "tempo", and how do we manipulate it to serve us? </TEXT>

<TITLE> CMV: Dressing/grooming "for yourself" is a nonsensical and impossible concept. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-07 09:16:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There's a fairly common statement I've seen made around these parts:

 I dress/groom myself for myself.

People (usually heterosexual women) who say this mean that they do not dress up, paint their nails, etc for the benefit of potential partners, but do so simply to feel good about their bodies.

I hold that this is an impossible statement. (I will use "clothing" from here on out, but all of this applies just as much to grooming, makeup, etc.) Clothing is inherently social. Fashion is subject to the whims of people. I think we can agree that trends are not just about utility - we often revisit clothing from eras gone by, implying that our clothes don't get objectively better with passage of time. If I dressed simply "for myself", I would find the clothes I like the most, and the chances of my tastes constantly aligning with changing trends would be fairly small - after all, I'm not concerned with how others view me, and clothing is not about utility, so it's not like I would be "using dated tech" if I didn't keep up with trends.

These people who claim to dress "for themselves" usually dress just like people who do so in order to please potential partners, which further undermines the idea to me that this is a thing that exists in a vacuum.

I can see no other way than that, fundamentally, dressing up *is* for the benefit of others. Even if it's not directly intended for actual men to see (e.g. a few women having a dinner party), there is the implicit male gaze factor: I'm dressing up to communicate to you, and by extension people (men) you will have contact with later, what sort of person I am (including describing my sexual availability).

I understand this is a fundamentally feminist concept, and I have no beef with that (I consider myself a feminist in training). I also understand that I'm probably missing a lot of detail. I want to better understand how this principle can be supported by logic. Please, CMV.

EDIT: Should have made this more clear:

 I'm talking about people who "dress up" (i.e. dress in a way that attempts to look as good as possible), and who don't simply dress in a utilitarian fashion (i.e. wear pants so you don't get cold).

EDIT 2: Thanks for the great discussion, everybody. /u/riggorous did a great job of explaining some key points [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3ntac6/cmv_dressinggrooming_for_yourself_is_a/cvr548m), if you want to read it.

Why does Teemo, as an AP-based autoattacker, succeed where Varus fails? 

Similarly, why is Varus's need to get in close considered such a huge weakness, when that is the case for virtually every ADC?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Should I learn Sublime's Vi mode? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-26 12:46:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Quick background on me:

* Started working as a developer a little over a year ago. 
* Working for a startup with only one other developer (the CTO). 
* Our product is a Rails app, so that encompasses Rails, Javascript, Sass, Haml. We're moving to Ember soon. I have to work on all of the above. 

I'm starting to get a better handle on the terminal. I enjoy using stuff like `grep` and the like. 

The CTO uses Sublime. He's a very "get shit done" kind of guy - I don't think he'd ever have the patience to learn something arcane like Vim. 

I'm a huge Sublime fan. I think it's a perfect mix of familiarity (its basic feature set mirrors your typical text editor, be it Notepad or a text field in a browser), capability (syntax highlighting, regex search), and extensibility (God I love plugins). It's also visually attractive - the fact that it's not limited to using monospace characters for the GUI means it's capable of more than Vim, graphically speaking. 

My terminal explorations have given me a Vim itch. However, I've done a lot of reading this weekend, and it's done nothing but convinced me that Vim *as a platform* is a horrible idea. 

What I'm not convinced about is the merits of Vim-style modal editing. I could see there being some point to it. (After all, in other aspects of computer use I pursue ergonomics and efficiency.)

So I'm wondering: should I try to learn vintage mode? Is it likely to be beneficial? I like the idea of being able to gradually transition instead of having to switch between apps when I get tired. It's also nice to know another person could use my setup without being completely lost.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Should I enable auto-attack in the game options? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-08-31 13:08:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have never played with the auto-attack option on. However, recently, I've been thinking it might be good to keep it on for certain scenarios:

* Immediately attacking wards when they're dropped next to me.
* At least sort of fighting back if I get caught while I'm looking at the other side of the map.
* At least sort of trying to CS if there are minions near me and I'm not paying attention.

Of course, the drawback here is that I could attack when I don't mean to, including:

<TITLE> Effective system for keeping track of DB migrations </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-08-19 13:11:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So this past week or two I've been having some headaches with respect to git branches and DB versions.

The short version:

* I started work on a feature branch that requires DB migrations.
* I keep having to switch between the feature branch and master in order to do hotfixes.
* My feature branch is somewhat behind master wrt DB migrations - there are one or two migrations on master that don't yet exist on my feature branch.

I know many might simply say "just merge master into feature", but that doesn't really work for my workflow - I'll merge it when I'm good and ready, haha.

What I'm looking for is a way to easily keep tabs of what version my DB is at on different branches.

I started using `tmux` yesterday (thanks to a post on reddit), which I'm finding quite enjoyable. I'm wondering if there isn't some sort of terminal-based script I could run in a `tmux` panel that could, for instance, show me the tail of `rake db:migrate:status` for various branches or something?

I don't mind having to do a little work to set this up either, I just don't really know how to go about it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I dream of a day when Ardent Censer is good </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-08-13 16:24:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Has anyone managed to find any success with Ardent Censer on Karma?

My recent build (which is sitting on a 70% winrate in ranked, potato Elo) looks like this:

* 9/0/21
* AP quints, scaling AP glyphs, HP seals, Mpen marks
* Spellthief  Sightstone  Morellonomicon   Boots  Zeke's  Sorceror's Shoes   Liandry's  ~~Spellthief~~ Deathcap

Then I started looking to see if I could get Ardent Censer to fit in there. The obvious candidate for replacement is Morellonomicon, for a few reasons:

* Both give mana, and +200% mana regen would be overkill
* Ardent Censer's on-hit damage is stronger in the early game

But the biggest problem with this is it would leave me at 30% CDR, which simply will not do. So I reconfigured, and tried out this build for a couple of games:

* 9/0/21, with AS in the offense tree instead of CDR
* AP quints, scaling AP glyphs, HP seals, Mpen marks
* Spellthief  Sightstone  Ardent Censer   Boots  Zeke's  Lucidity   Liandry's  ~~Spellthief~~ Deathcap

This effectively means I'm trading 15 Mpen, 40 AP, and Grievous Wounds for a small amount of AS, 200 gold, MS, and the Censer passive. I figured it would work pretty well.

It really doesn't, though. I've played it in five games and won two. IIRC, the first one had the enemy Lucian AFK after Pickaxe, so it hardly counts, and in another we got carried pretty hard by Riven and Yi.

I feel like, with the latter loadout, my harass simply isn't anywhere close to as strong as it usually is. Qs feel like they do nothing. Es feel like they absorb nothing. My entire laning phase feels less impactful - which is *bizarre*, because with Ardent Censer coming in 200 gold sooner, my ADC should be making up for my lower contribution with the Censer passive.

I also don't want to go the utility route. The item would work well enough if I went Locket etc (I think, anyway), but that's not what I'm about - I want to be an AP support.

Anyone have any advice? Did I just have bad luck in those games I lost? What can I do to this build to fix the issues while maintaining the spirit of the build? </TEXT>

<TITLE> How would you feel about Ardent Censer getting +10% CDR? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-08-11 10:43:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So Ardent Censer right now is in an awkward place. It's not a bad item, but it's a little hard to fit into a build due to an awkward combination of stats.

The item grants the same level of mana regenaration as Morellonomicon or Athene's (ignoring the unique passives on the latter), two items which AP supports build fairly often. If Ardent Censer offered 20% CDR, it would also have the same CDR as those two items. This would mean you could choose Morellonomicon, Athene's, or Ardent Censer based solely on the AP and utility each item offers.

**Morellonomicon** would be the best choice for raw AP, good for Lulus or Sorakas who want to maximise damage, shields, or healing.

**Athene's** would offer more mana, which would aid supports with extreme mana costs (Lux?), as well as offering some MR versus heavy magic damage comps.

**Ardent Censer** would offer the least AP, while giving a strong passive for the early game - great for Karmas and Sorakas supporting ADCs like Lucian or Sivir.

<TITLE> What are the actual differences between HP and armour/MR runes? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-08-01 19:47:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There's a lot of discussion around runes that relies on subjective, anecdotal "evidence", my favourite example being "[rune type] is just better". 

What are the **provable** differences between taking HP seals and taking armour/MR seals/glyphs?

Here are some of my thoughts. 

* If you have a shield that scales with HP, HP might be better. If you have a shield that doesn't scale with HP, resistances are better. If you have a shield that scales with AP, HP seals + AP glyphs might be better than resistances. 
* If you have healing (of any kind - lifesteal etc) that is not a percentage of max HP, resistances multiply its value, whereas HP does not. 
* There's an optimal curve of HP vs resistances, and it would be wise to pick runes that approach that curve.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT>  I call it my billion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the null reference in 1965. At that time, I was designing the first comprehensive type system for references in an object oriented language (ALGOL W). My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn't resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years.

<TITLE> Need some advice on how to make the most of a small space (pics inside) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-19 22:19:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My girlfriend and I are moving around November into [this flat](http://imgur.com/tK4HY1y) or something very similar (renders   photo from Gumtree). We're trying to figure out how we can make the most of such a small space. [render 1](http://imgur.com/FB9YMM4) | [render 2](http://imgur.com/cv8HOA8) | [render 3](http://imgur.com/WfzmPTR)

The biggest question for us: **how can we have an entertainment area as well as a second workspace**? She uses a laptop but strongly prefers sitting at a desk for the most part. I use a Mac Mini (for now, anyway) so I can't really work on a couch. We have a 32" HD TV which I feel is a strong candidate for dual use as a TV and a computer monitor, but I'm not clear on how to mount it so that it can serve both purposes. The renders I attached will show there's very little space between the kitchen wall and the opposite wall; even so, I was thinking to put a couch (about 1.6m by 0.8m) with its back to the kitchen counter, and mount the TV on the wall.

But that doesn't leave a whole lot of space between the couch and the TV, which is a problem because **we have a lot of stuff** (particularly clothes   books). Another question I have is how we can effectively **separate the "bedroom" from the "lounge"**. I think we'd both struggle to live in a space where you're constantly "in the same space", as opposed to having different areas dedicated to different purposes and delineated from each other. We figured we could kill two birds with one stone here and place a bookshelf in between the bed and the lounge area - is this a good idea?

Finally, any good tips on **how to keep neat** in general are highly appreciated.

First post in this sub - I tried to follow the rules in the sidebar.

<TITLE> BSOD: IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL and DRIVER_CORRUPTED_EXPOOL </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-14 21:51:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi folks. I'm getting some annoying BSODs. At first I thought this was League of Legends's fault, but earlier today I experienced a BSOD without the game running in any form so there's that theory out the window.

[System info](http://gyazo.com/7036e87ec40ca7a7d8e0ec507fb78552)

(As I type this, DxDiag is giving me a worrying message about not being able to access the system data before?)

I tried enabling Driver Verifier, but it just sent my PC into a reboot loop. However, unlike other cases that I read about online, it didn't actually BSOD before rebooting - it would just silently fail a couple of frames into the Windows "spinny stuff" startup animation. I've included an ntbtlog.txt that was generated while Driver Verifier was activated.

[DxDiag   ntbtlog.txt](https://gist.github.com/subject998/3d9aeb34531915eb2e40)

[BlueScreenView](http://gyazo.com/3d47c8c699a61e982cca20a0ca1c9f8d)

I experienced at least two BSODs earlier while playing League, and one after while not playing League. The only applications I had open in both cases were Chrome (43.0.2357.132) and iTunes (11.0.2.26).

EDIT: Oh! And I ran memtest twice this weekend, passed both times. I did last week update my video drivers, but the BSODs persisted across the update.

EDIT 2: If you're going to downvote my question, at least tell me why.

EDIT 3: For anyone who finds this: it seems the problem might have been Catalyst Control Center's hotkeys. Since deactivating those and restarting I haven't seen another BSOD.

EDIT 4: Disregard. I did BSOD again. The problem was Networx. I have since uninstalled and not had a BSOD in months. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I want to start putting some of my #bigplays on YouTube, but I'm not sure how to go about it. Raptr has proven to be pretty great for recording stuff on the fly, but the problem is it records my music as well, which I understand is going to get my videos pulled pronto.

Does anyone know of a good setup whereby I can listen to music as well as in-game sound but not record the music into my videos? I'm tech-savvy and a former sound engineer so I'm not afraid to tinker with this stuff, I just don't know of any software that can achieve what I'm trying to do.

EDIT: I was mostly thinking along the lines of doing clever routing with JACK or something that keeps game audio and iTunes separate before the recording and then mixes them down to stereo, but I don't really think that's possible. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Please help me get back to Silver! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-13 13:09:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I started playing on the 31st of July last year. It's safe to say I've gotten pretty addicted since! I started playing ranked the moment I hit 30, hoping to get that sweet Morgana skin. No dice, though - I landed in Silver 2, and dropped to Silver 4 by the end of the season.

When season 5 started, I immediately played my placements, got into Bronze 3, then fell to Bronze 4 and have been fluctuating between those two tiers ever since.

I'm super annoyed because I feel like I definitely haven't gotten *worse* at the game. I'd really like to get back up to Silver so I can start wishing I could get up to Gold, lol.

The facts:

* I'm essentially a support main, but I've started playing mid more. I feel like any old solo queue support is likely to do things like provide vision and objective control, but mids tend not to, so by playing mid I'm ensuring that our team probably has two people looking after those things, instead of probably just the one.
* I really like mages. My favourite supports are Morgana and Karma, though I play the former more often in ranked due to her sheer power. (Super hyped for the incoming Karma buffs though!) Mid I like playing Karma and Lux, and have recently picked up Akali (who is quite similar to but more forgiving than my old flame Diana).
* I've started practicing CSing before games. I load into a 1v3 bot match and play only the first five minutes, aiming to get to 1k gold by the end. I'm getting better at it.
* As a support, I always rush Sightstone and make sure to have a ward or two in river against ganks. I will also always have a pink on the map somewhere, usually a defensive one, and I will replace it as it gets destroyed (which almost never happens, yay Bronze). When we get a kill or two and the opportunity presents itself, I'll drop deeper wards to get some vision of the enemy jungle.
* I'll hold on to survival tools like Flash, Barrier, Zhonya's too long, and get burst down before I can activate them.
* Related, I hold on to summoner spells too long. When I play support, I almost never use Exhaust until it's way too late (I think this is related to me not being able to spot when an engage is happening vs when the enemy is just harassing). When I play jungle with Stalker's Blade, I forget to Smite champs.
* I just make shitty mechanical mistakes. I use my skills in the wrong order. I don't take enough care when clicking targets and end up autoing a minion instead of the enemy champ.
* I often underestimate how far I am from safety, especially when we're pushed up in bottom lane. I'll see an enemy coming down the river to gank, and will walk back at a leisurely pace only to get deleted before I'm even in my turret's range.

I'm sure there's loads more issues that replays will uncover. [Here is my op.gg page.](http://euw.op.gg/summoner/matches/userName=subject998)

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A few weeks ago I had a game where the enemy team had a Nidalee top and Ahri mid. On our side, there was an Annie and a Lissandra. Neither of our solo laners took Teleport (they both had Ignite), so we had some flexibility in terms of who goes where.

How would you have assigned the solo laners, purely in terms of "countering"? Of course things like general familiarity with playing vs the enemy laner are also important, but assuming Annie and Liss were equally skilled   equally comfortable playing vs Nida and Ahri, and vice versa, who should have taken which lane?

I was trying to figure it out for myself in terms of CC. Both Annie and Liss have some nice CC on their side, and both Nida and Ahri have to stay mobile to stay alive. Given that Ahri's recent changes have moved her away from assassination, I'm inclined to think Liss should go vs Nida as she is safer, being able to ult herself if caught by a spear. But Ahri is annoyingly mobile, and Lissandra's CC and mobility would be really useful to lock her down (naturally, Annie can stun Ahri, but if Ahri manages to survive the burst, there's almost zero chance she'll die unless both her Flash and her ult are on CD).

<TITLE> HP printer is full of shit. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-23 20:26:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My family has an HP 4625 Deskjet printer   scanner. This fucking thing refuses to work in any sort of capacity for longer than three minutes. I apologise in advance if this post is unclear or lacking information, which is very likely because this goddamn printer has been driving me insane for over a year.

What we want is the following:

* The printer should connect to all our PCs via the house wifi network.
* It should be usable from any of our PCs, primarily a Win7 laptop, Win8 laptop, Win8 desktop, and Win7 desktop (in order of priority).
* Both printing and scanning should work, to/from any of the above-mentioned machines.

What has happened throughout the lifetime of this godforsaken printer is that it refuses to be accessible through the network. In every case, we give up and settle for installing it to the Win7 laptop as a USB printer/scanner and sharing it over the network, but even that is extremely temperamental - scanning almost never works, and printer sharing is unavailable half the time too. Furthermore, the Win7 laptop frequently leaves the house for work, which means the rest of us can't print.

I've now factory-reset the printer and uninstalled all its software from the Win7 laptop. I'm attempting to reinstall, and already I hit a problem: the install process is able to find the printer on the network, but it cannot find it using "the typical network discovery method". It suggests that maybe the problem is the firewall, but I have *disabled the goddamn firewall* and still this error persists. [See here.](http://i.imgur.com/SGdPsJj.png)

I'm not willing to proceed with setting the printer up using a cable, because the fact that it's already giving me bullshit network-related errors tells me that the networking functionality is extremely likely to not work later either.

We've tried in the past to set the printer and the laptop to fixed IPs, but that didn't work.

The primary system's specs are as follows:

* Samsung 530U laptop
* Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 (64-bit)
* 4GB RAM
* i5 3317U
* 1TB HDD (with 700GB free space... how do people *not* fill up their hard drives? Amazing)

Wifi is provided by a Netgear WNR3500. If need be, I can get access to stuff like the router password if this is going to require advanced configuration.

I just want the fucking product my parents bought with their genuinely hard-earned money to *fucking work*. Is that too much to ask?

Sorry for the excess NaCl. Eternal gratitude if one of you grossly incandescent folks can help me sort this out. I'm tired of banging my head against this particular wall every other month.

EDIT: Thanks for all the brilliant suggestions and advice! Unfortunately, this printer does not have an Ethernet port, so that invalidates what pretty much half of you have suggested. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Background: started playing around August. Placed Silver 2 just before season ended. Got straight demotions to Silver 5. Placed Bronze 3. Got demoted to Bronze 4, then today went 2-1 in my promos so I'm back in B3. I'm more or less a support main, but the two victories were playing jungle Fiddlesticks. 

I'm not a great jungler. I end up just farming all day. So in my games today, I tried to change that, and went for level 2 ganks. Both times, I managed to burn a flash from the enemy top laner. The latter game, it resulted in a kill for my top laner two minutes later. 

Why don't I see more people doing this? You can clear Krugs or Gromp for instant level 2, then immediately head to lane to gank before the enemy dings 2. On Fiddlesticks specifically, that means you have full health and access to either Terrify or Dark Wind, both of which make escaping harder. Plus you have more damage   health from being higher level. Common wisdom is to ward river after 3:30, so you can even get there unseen. 

I never see players at my level doing this, and I don't see it in LCS either. What gives?  </TEXT>

I recommend you click Data - Filter views - Create new filter view. This will allow you to filter by champ, attack range, damage type, etc. When you go into a match, filter the champ column to show the champs involved in the match. This way you can easily see most of their important stats at a glance.

This is still a WIP - many columns are missing things. Please, if you see an improvement I could make, leave a comment on the sheet! Especially with regards to the last two columns.

<TEXT> You have a single-use time machine that will give you one round trip visit to a date of your choice in the past. You are to visit a creator - artist, scientist, inventor, composer - and show them one of their greatest works, just for kicks. 

Your time machine will provide power for any devices you take with you, and it also allows for Internet   mobile connectivity to the present in case those things are needed to display the work. You're allowed to take other devices like speakers with you (if for instance the work in question is a recording of a musical performance). 

You get to choose the stage in the creator's life where you visit them - it can be during childhood, a particularly difficult time, etc. 

Your time machine will wipe the creator's memory of the encounter, but only after you leave. While you're there, you can also display the work to other people; their memories will also be wiped. The purpose of the visit is solely to get a kick out of showing someone the awesome shit they get up to later in life. 

The time machine emanates a psychic field that helps people understand the situation, preventing you from being lynched for being a witch. 

EDIT: You can also elect to show the creator a work by someone else that derives from their own. For instance, you might wish to play Schoenberg a piece of noise music, or show whoever came up with the atomic model an SEM photo of an atom.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Does Karma counter Gnar? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-15 10:11:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've played a lot of Karma, and yesterday I decided to try her out in toplane. My second game I was laning against Gnar.

Having seen how terrifying the little bastard can be, and knowing I'm inexperienced in playing Karma in top, I opted for flask start.

I outsustained Gnar so hard that I forced him out of lane three times. I managed to take him down twice by proxy - once by a Jinx rocket and once by a Zed gank.

It got me wondering: is Karma a surprising counter to Gnar? She pokes so hard, she can really punish him when he's in Mini Gnar form, and can shield and RW through any damage he puts out. She has decent mobility from her shield to juke boomerangs.

It just seemed really easy to play a farm lane and get some nice items. (And then TP into teamfights and drop AoE shield on everyone.)

I should note the player I was up against is about as good as I am - similar KDA, slightly higher rank, slightly lower ranked win rate, etc.

Thoughts?

<TEXT> In the last two days, I've played maybe 3 or 4 games with two ADCs bot instead of ADC + support. Is this a thing or did I just get matched with bad players?

I can't imagine how it would make any sense, you're just dividing your farm between two people. Sure you'd push objectives like crazy once you farm enough, but one ADC plus a split-pushing toplaner or jungler could achieve the same without delaying their power spikes until 30 minutes. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Twisted Fate support: Relic Shield or Spellthief's Edge? (Or Ancient Coin?) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-03 11:13:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I picked up TF yesterday, for the express purpose of playing him as a support. I usually play champs like Karma   Nidalee - people who poke a lot, in other words. I thought TF's non-skillshot stun, AoE slow, long-ranged poke, vision, teleport,   gold income passive made him a great candidate for a support.

However, I'm having some trouble deciding on the best gold income item for him. My usual go-to item for similar supports is Spellthief's, because I poke *a lot*. Until last week, I always upgraded it to FQC as soon as possible, reasoning that it's a useful item in its own right and getting it sooner means exponentially better cash returns. However, I'm slowly coming around to the more common practice of just leaving it as Spellthief's and selling it later.

With TF, his gold income passive necessitates last hitting, which doesn't work with Spellthief's (until that gets upgraded to FQC, at which point minion kills no longer disable the passive). The boosted income from his passive synergises so perfectly with Relic Shield, but he's a ranged champ so he gets no execute, and the stats aren't core for him.

So which of these is the better option? Or am I being retarded? Should I buy Ancient Coin instead (good stats and a nice active at max tier)?

Please, /r/summonerschool, make me rich! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Diana: Magus or Devourer? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been playing Diana as a bruiser in the jungle, building Magus alongside Nashor's Tooth. This gets me 40% CDR, attack speed to help proc my passive, a chunk of AP, and some on-hit magic damage to round it out. 

However, today I started wondering if Devourer isn't maybe a better option. It would allow me to take Morellonomicon (or Athene's) for CDR and get some mana in the process. However, I would probably leave out Nashor's then, which means I need to find CDR elsewhere. DFG has nice CDR and AP but I don't know if its active is that great for Di. Other CDR items give much less AP. Or maybe I should take Frozen Heart? 

I dunno.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Featured mode idea: SUPER CHAMP BOX </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-04 19:18:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Vlambeer's excellent shooter Super Crate Box subverts traditional shooter mechanics by "punishing" you for getting points. It does this by replacing your current weapon with a random one. 

In the same spirit, I propose this: a 5v5 mode on Summoner's Rift, with the key difference that **whenever you kill a large minion or monster, or get a kill or assist, or destroy a turret or inhibitor, your champ transforms to a random one you own**.

Much like URF and O4A (and the upcoming Poro King), the idea here is simply to cause chaos and make stupid shit happen. 

Your skill levels will persist between champs (with a bonus point in the ult in the case of champs like Karma and Nidalee). This will have some strategic implications: max one ability, or spread them out? Cooldowns carry over proportionally, meaning a Q that had 5 seconds left on a 15 second cooldown will have 2 seconds left if it becomes a Q with a 6 second cooldown. Mana and health carry over proportionally as well. 

Your items also persist. Now, you may think this would result in fairly boring builds that just split evenly down the middle of tank, AD, and AP; but that's because you're fundamentally a boring person. No, just as likely is the risk-taker's approach, where you build according to one role and use minions and monsters to re-roll until you get an appropriate champ.

Permanent stacking buffs like Nasus and Veigar have will persist, though those that interact with specific abilities (like Nasus's) still only interact with those abilities. (Yes, this means you can farm AP as Veigar and transfer it to a different champ...) 

The enemy team will only know who you are while they have vision of you. This allows teams to set up surprise attacks where anything could happen! 

Teamfights will be hilarious melees where getting a kill means forcing your entire team to switch champs, throwing them into disarray and giving the enemy a chance to return the favour. In fact, any objective taken by a team gives them a brief moment of vulnerability while they adjust to their new champs. 

Some unique self-combos will be made possible, especially with champs like Katarina who can reset their cooldowns. 

Udyr would probably be disabled due to his weird skill point system.

<TITLE> About Azir and Nashor's Tooth </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-02 09:06:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So two weeks ago, I was discussing Azir with /u/Molleckt in another thread. I asserted Nashor's Tooth is a bad buy on Azir; Molleckt disagreed. I said I would do some theorycrafting when I got back to my PC, and while it took me way too long, here are my results. :)

Preface: I've used fairly "standard" runes   masteries. None of them should interfere too much with the test (the most interesting thing there is 10% CDR). The items used are Deathcap, Zhonya's, Rylai's, Liandry's, Sorc shoes. We will compare Nashor's to another AP item that gives 20% CDR, Morellonomicon.

    				w/ Nashor's		w/ Morellonomicon
    Attack speed:	1.353			1.053
    AP:				760.1			787.4
    Soldier damage:	702.07			721.18
    (170 + 70%)
    Soldier DPS:	949.90071		759.40254

From this, we can see that Nashor's does indeed increase the soldiers' DPS by a substantial amount. However, let's take this simulation a step further. Assume an opponent who has average base movement speed (we'll use Xerath), and is wearing Sorceror's Shoes with the Alacrity enchantment (other enchantments give higher movement speed, but are conditional). Assume the soldier we spawn starts attacking when the enemy is 20 units away (ie the soldier was spawned next to them), and they immediately start walking away once the first attack lands. We will apply the slow from Rylai's. Let's see how many attacks we get in.

    Movement speed:	426.4 * 0.85 = 362.44
    Soldier range:	400
    Time to escape:	(400-20) / 362.44 = 1.048
    
    				w/ Nashor's		w/ Morellonomicon
    Attacks:		1.417 (ie 1)	1.103 (ie 1)
    Total damage:	702.07			721.18

Let's try a different scenario. We'll use the same opponent - Xerath with Alacrity Sorceror's Shoes - but we'll spawn two soldiers, and initiate with the slow. Assume Xerath starts walking the instant he gets hit by the dash, and for the sake of not involving too much geometry, assume the distance to cover is still 400 units.

    Speed for 1s:			426.4 * 0.85 * 0.75 = 271.83
    Ground covered in 1s:	271.83
    Speed for .5s:			426.4 * 0.85 = 362.44
    Ground covered in .5s:	181.22
    Total time to escape:	1.353 seconds
    
    				w/ Nashor's		w/ Morellonomicon
    Q damage:		718.7625		735.825
    Attacks (each):	1.917 (ie 1)	1.424 (ie 1)
    Total damage:	2122.9025		2178.185

So in conclusion: Nashor's is unlikely to beat the damage output of something like Morellonomicon **if** Azir is acting alone. Naturally, League is a team game, so you will usually not be acting alone. But by the same token, the enemy team is going to do their best to stay out of range of your soldiers, and just like your allies will use CC to try to keep them there, they will use shields, speed boosts, and other tricks to stay away.

If you ask me, stacking AP is much better. :)

EDIT: In terms of gold efficiency, the attack speed buff is worth 1500 gold. 1500 gold is enough to get you another 60 AP, which I think would do far more to increase Azir's damage output. </TEXT>

<TITLE> First principles: Diana and the new jungle items </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-13 13:42:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The new jungle items aren't out yet, and as a player who plays Diana jungle every chance I can get, I'm going a little crazy trying to figure out which items will be good on her.

In my opinion, it comes down to either Stalker's Blade or Skirmisher's Sabre. For those who don't know, here's what they do:

**Stalker's Blade** lets you Smite enemy champions for:

* 10% of Smite's damage
* a 50% slow
* 2-second duration

**Skirmisher's Sabre** lets you Smite enemy champions for:

* vision
* 6.25% of Smite's damage on-hit
* 20% damage reduction against the targeted champ
* 6-second duration

Now, I would argue that Diana has no problems repeatedly closing the gap. Her E also gives her an anti-escape tool with a brief slow. This leads me to favour Skirmisher's. (Let it never be said that I don't absolutely adore on-hit damage. Nashor's Tooth 4 lyfe)

However, the overwhelming opinion in this sub so far seems to point to Stalker's being almost the default pick for gankers.

But then, I build Di like a fighter, not an assassin, so maybe I should be ignoring ganks and looking towards the mid-late game brawls and teamfights, where the Sabre's damage on hit can really wreck a team, the damage reduction can somewhat hamstring whoever's trying to focus her down, and the vision can let her chase down anyone trying to escape through the jungle.

Bring your best theorycrafting game and let's see if we can find some answers. </TEXT>

Usually, my first item after Sightstone   Frostfang (  occasionally boots) will be a mana item, typically Athene's. However, I think I'm overdoing it. I play super pokey, and tend to spam my spells (eg Karma Q) early which causes mana problems. I think I then overcompensate by buying powerhouses like Athene's, plus Frost Queen's Claim, plus masteries, plus miscellaneous other mana regen sources.

How much mana regen is enough? I'd love some hard numbers, like x mana per 5 at a certain level/phase of the game. I always max out CDR for max spammage as well.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi everyone. I'm trying to make my site's user signup a bit nicer - specifically when it comes to the social media input fields. I want them to look like this: http://imgur.com/ar6rkgX

The idea is that it *looks* like the "http://www.facebook.com/" bit is a part of the text box's contents, but it isn't really - it's actually a label or something that's positioned to look that way. This way the prompt is dead simple to understand but the user can't actually delete that bit of text. But then I also want the text field to be focused if the user clicks the label, which naturally entails some JQuery or something.

Problem is, I have no idea what sort of search terms to use, and everything I've tried just gives me crappy "social media marketing" results I care less than zero about.

Halp?

I could do this myself, I'm just hoping there's a quick and easy premade solution. Site's built on Rails if it matters.

It's still a skillshot dash, but there's a 1.5 second delay before it fires, during which our champ (referred to as Pulp for now) is unable to move (or if that's too restrictive, he is slowed, like Vi or Xerath while charging their respective abilities). The direction is set when the skill is activated, so some prediction is required in terms of where the enemy will be.

Also, Pulp no longer picks up the first ally he hits. Instead, the first ally to right-click him after activation of the skillshot is the one who will get picked up. The ally must be within close range of Pulp (say 400). If no-one right-clicks him by the time the delay ends, the ability fires anyway and no-one is carried along for the ride.

*****

(If you don't know what a pulp hero is, think of guys like The Shadow, The Phantom, The Green Hornet. Old-timey pre-superhero heroes.) 

Inspired by the scene in Winter Soldier where Cap grabs BW and dives through a window to avoid a grenade, I came up with a cool champ concept that could have some interesting interactions with the current meta. 

Where Thresh and Blitz focus on moving enemies around, and other champs like Lee Sin or LeBlanc focus on moving themselves around, I thought: what about a champ that moves his *teammates* around? I'm not talking movement speed buffs either - I envision his signature (Q?) being a skillshot dash that picks up the first ally he hits and deposits them at the end, perhaps with a little buff to attack/move speed. This champ could save lives by spiriting away squishy mages, or he could drop a Nasus-shaped ton of bricks next to the enemy marksman. 

Other abilities could include: 

* A short, quick roll (visually similar to Vayne's) that 'dodges' (ignores) basics during the animation 
* An enhanced basic with a short stun - the ol' one-two 
* A Batman-style, cape-spread intimidation move - maybe 1s fear in a cone? 
* A 'grab' where he roots a champ by grabbing onto them (during which he can't do anything), increasing the damage of the next attack against them. 

Thoughts? Really the other abilities are just icing on the cake. It's all about the dash. I just think it's a cool concept that would fit well - both gameplay-wise, as it enables new plays and new team comps (and perhaps less of a focus on Flash), and lore-wise, as the game loves 'renegade hero' types. Suggested name: 'Noxus Batman'. (jk) 

This champ would be a support primary, though perhaps he could have a secondary fighter classification if his abilities allow. His stats would be fairly fighterish in either case - decent health, armour   damage. He would be a melee champ, definitely. I have no idea what sort of passive would work.

I imagine a typical build could be something like:

* Face of the Mountain - for the tanky stats and the shield, which would be really useful when transporting allies into combat
* Sightstone
* Mobility Boots - to help him get to allies in trouble
* Frozen Heart
* Locket of the Iron Solari
* Randuin's Omen </TEXT>

<TITLE> General advice on my current Lux support build? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-26 15:57:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As I make the climb to 30, I've fallen back in love with playing Lux as a support. Before, I never really *built* her as a support - the big AP items were just too tempting! - but now I've given it a good rethink and have arrived at a build that has worked pretty nicely.

It's not perfect, though, and I would love to hear any tips from more experienced players. I'm actually only concerned with items - I don't have money for runes and I'm happy with my masteries at 0/0/21 (I'm level 21).

So, the items:

* Talisman of Ascension
* Mikael's Crucible
* Twin Shadows
* Ardent Censer
* Sightstone
* Mobility Boots

I start with Ancient Coin, 1 health pot, 1 mana pot, a ward, and a warding totem. I already struggle early on to decide between Chalice for mana, boots for mobility, Nomad's for money, and the Sightstone for vision. (I do take Clairvoyance as one of my spells but I'm not comfortable enough with the game's pacing to rely on it fully as an early warning measure against ganks.) The longer I delay the Sightstone, the more I end up burning on wards, but the Sightstone doesn't give me anything useful except for a bit of health, which without armour or MR doesn't amount to much.

If I'm ahead, I tend to rush Twin Shadows to help my team chase down runaways. If I'm behind, I try to get Mikael's for some sustain and defence.

Late game I'll pick up the Ardent Censer once everything else is done, but I feel like it doesn't benefit us much. My timing with my W tends to be late, so I feel like by the time it hits my teammates the need for it has already passed.

I'm also worried I'm overdoing it a bit with the mana - almost all of the above items come with huge mana regen, which might be overkill.

Any thoughts?

EDIT: My playstyle in lane tends to be quite aggressive and pokey, which is part of why I have such a focus on CDR and mana. I'm constantly tossing Qs and Es to try and zone opponents, and on occasion actually catch them out so my ADC can take them down.

EDIT 2: Hahaha, alright, alright, I yield! :D I will find a different champ to play!

Thanks for the input everyone! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone! I recently hit lv20 and started getting some basic rune pages going. I would like to have two pages for now: one for AD-based champs and one for AP-based champs.

I already have flat armour yellows and scaling MR blues. I'm planning to get AD or APen reds for AD and AP or MPen reds for AP (any advice here would also be great).

I'm looking for some tips regarding which quints to get. It would be nice if I could use the same ones on both pages - save me a lot of IP! - but if that's a really bad idea then please let me know.

I mostly play Nasus top, Lux support, Diana mid, and the occasional Warwick jungle or Morgana support. My long-term goal is to main support, maybe jungle as well (since jungling shares some aspects with supporting).

Thanks in advance! 3 </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did a bad thing.

I started downloading the game through the Gaz client. Then, I got annoyed with the client so I tried installing the game via Steam.

Then I got told that the Steam updates were *much* bigger than the Gaz updates, which for my capped bandwidth is a bad, bad thing. So I decided to go back to the Gaz client.

Now, the problem is that Steam still thinks I want to play the game via their system, so it keeps trying to download the game files. Despite the fact that I've been playing MH2015 for weeks already via the Gaz client.

Is there a way I can remove MH2015 from my Steam games? Or at least stop Steam from ever downloading a single file for it, at any point, ever, never ever?

<TEXT> I finished school seven and a half years ago. Since then, I've been studying one thing after the other - almost all unsuccessfully - on my parents' dime, while living in a flat they paid for.

Every semester, it would be the same pattern: I'd stop attending class, lie to my parents and my live-in girlfriend about it, and then have a fight at the end of the semester when my results came. Once, I even forged exam results, which hurt my family deeply.

I've been to see therapists, but it never took.

At the start of this year, both my parents and my girlfriend told me this was my last chance.

I finally admitted today that I'd failed everything and that I need help. I packed a bag of clothes and my computer and went to stay with my parents. Everything sucks and I have no future, but everyone loves me and is willing to help.

I wish I could have avoided these mistakes in the first place. My girlfriend is extremely dependent on me for getting to and from work and for buying stuff and keeping the house clean, and now I'm not there to help her. And my parents have sunk so much money into giving me third and fourth and fifth chances, so much so that they've had to dig into their retirement fund - they're in their mid-50s and have sunk a lot of money into two business ventures, one of which tanked and the other one is only going to be profitable enough for my dad to get a good salary in a few years' time.

But all in all I feel good. I don't feel suicidal any more, and I didn't get kicked out onto the street like I was expecting.

Thanks for reading. </TEXT>

Naw but seriously, I've just had like my 5th or 6th win (on Easy (I'm just trying to unlock all the ships)) with that loadout. Rock B this time.

I just feel like nothing comes close to that loadout. You have the Ion for hosing shields, the Halberd for rekking shit, and the Flak for supporting both. You can consistently break through 4 shields and still cause damage with this, even without hacking. Your charge time is very nicely self-optimised, as the Ion and Flak will fire twice and once respectively, for a maximum of 4 shields down, before the Halberd is ready. And the best part is, it leaves you with 1 slot open (on 4-slot ships), so you can have another more situational weapon to swap in when needed.

Or am I being stupid? Is there a "more optimal" 3-weapon loadout? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Please explain sexual liberty to me. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-18 07:39:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have been slowly educating myself on gender issues over the last year or two. I consider myself an ally.

However, one thing I seem to be at odds with other feminists about is promiscuity and sexually provocative dress and behaviour, all of which I believe falls under the umbrella of 'sexual liberty'.

I feel extremely uncomfortable about promiscuous behaviour. I think it devalues sex, besides also being hazardous to health (both in terms of STI's and unplanned pregnancy). I feel uncomfortable as well when presented with - and I apologise for using the term here, but it captures my feelings best - 'slutty' dress and behaviour.

However, the message I'm getting from the feminist side is that each person should be free to do with their body what they want.

Why is sexual liberty important? It feels to me like campaigning to be allowed to do something 'bad'. Like, I believe promiscuity is not something we should embrace, so why make it part of the broader scope of women's issues?

I suspect the answers are going to primarily revolve around rape culture, but I fail to see how.

(For reference: I'm a white African male in my mid-twenties, and in a committed relationship of over 6 years.)

<TEXT> A month or so ago, I did some freelance work and promised myself I would get DkS2 when my money came. Today was the day.

I'm coming from the DkS1 subreddit, where there's a lot of negativity and "they don't make 'em like they used to" attitude. But I resisted those negative vibes, just as I resisted spoilers, and man, was I not disappointed.

One minor... queerness about DkS1, for me, was the load screen/character creation music. That music never gelled with the vibe of the rest of the game. A small part of me longed to play the game that that music suggested.

I think DkS2 has exactly the atmosphere that track suggested. It's dreamy and weird and surreal and I love it. Majula took my breath away. Where Lordran is a crumbling, hopeless ruin, Drangleic has something optimistic and beautiful about it. Like none of us know why we're here, but it might all turn out okay in the end.

I'm also loving the mechanics. Movement is much more slick. Parrying is hard as, which is nice because it makes it less OP (and because after several playthroughs of DkS1 I'd kind of 75% mastered it). Dodging is also tough but very precise. I love the new stun mechanics. I love that 100% physical block is (so far) nowhere to be seen. Combat feels brutal again. Healing is less powerful. Everything comes back down to stamina management and battlefield control.

I've beaten the Last Giant, Dragonrider, the three lucerne hammer dudes, and the Pursuer. All were really satisfying. When I met the Giant, I was literally sitting there going NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE. The Pursuer is just a total badass, I just wish I was fast enough on the uptake to take him on when he first appeared. The three sentinels were really tough but made me feel like an S-tier BAMF when I finally brought them down. The Dragonrider was tough but I beat him first time, though I was terrified he was going to have a dragon-related second phase.

Even the mobs are really cool. I love that two-handing has been made more common among mobs - I really enjoy fighting the Royal Swordsmen.

I just wish I could find a greatsword somewhere!

Basically this game is everything I hoped it would be, and I can't wait to play more tomorrow, and I probably won't read a single reply to this because I hate spoilers hahaha :D

<TEXT> * Skeletons: you should not be fighting skeletons in a graveyard when you finish the tutorial. They're probably too tough for you at this point. Come back later.
* Ghosts: see above
* Knight Shield: it's worse than almost any other shield you can obtain at this point.
* Drake Sword: yes yes all the 'OP IN 20 MINUTES' guides tell you to get this. Don't. It's about as strong as a reasonably upgraded normal weapon, but there are two huge problems with it. One, it doesn't get stronger as you level up Str or Dex, which means later on, other weapons outclass it quite quickly. Two, and this is the real important one, **it prevents you from learning the game in the first few areas, making it impossible to beat anything later**. Seriously, guys: I invade in the Parish. Normally I would give you a fair fight, but if I see a Drake Sword, I'm getting out my maxed-out elemental weapons. Are we clear?

<TEXT> I've been invading newbs in the Parish as an SL16 Dickwraith with unupgraded gear. It's a lot of fun, and I lose most of the time, but I don't mind - I just want to give new people another tough enemy to fight (and maybe make them soil themselves a little).

However, dead angling really ruins my day. In part, what baffles me about it is that Dark Souls is otherwise extremely precise in its hitboxes. Frustrating, then, to be killed by a Halberd R1 while I'm blocking and standing behind my opponent.

As a programmer, I understand exactly why dead-angling happens. But I also understand why lag makes it unbearable, and I *also* understand that it would be a trivial fix (whichever party calculates the blocking would just need to take the other player's facing - which it already has - into account).

It sucks that a game with a combat system this good would be reduced to shitty lagstabs   dead angles in PvP.

<TEXT> On Saturday, my friend (B), girlfriend (A), and myself were able to have a roaring good time playing Torchlight 2. We were using B's desktop machine, his old laptop, and A's laptop. We were all connected via B's home wi-fi.

On Sunday, A and I decided to play a game, with different chars. So we rerolled. This time, we were playing on my desktop and her laptop. We connected via our home wi-fi. It took some finagling, as the firewall settings on my PC weren't great (blame Norton), but we had a good 6-hour-ish session.

Yesterday, A and I wanted to continue our game. Bear in mind, at no point did we make any changes to our network configuration. But we could no longer see each other's games. We tried having her laptop host the game. We tried a different router. We tried connecting the PCs via crossover. Nothing. On one attempt out of 50, we could see the game, but then got "connection failed".

Today, I even tried creating new characters on each PC, as a Google result showed me some people were having trouble starting a game with existing characters, but no luck.

A thorough Google search has brought up absolutely nothing.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm writing a clipboard manager using Python 3, tkinter, pywin32. The hotkey WIN+V brings up the interface. Once the user chooses a clip to paste, the interface minimises itself. At this point, I want to restore focus to whatever program had keyboard focus before WIN+V was pressed.

Chrome is one program I've found that doesn't play nice with restoring focus. If I open a new Chrome tab, click in the search field in the middle of the screen, and then press WIN+V and choose a clip to paste:

* `win32gui.SetForegroundWindow(hwnd)` (where `hwnd` is either Chrome's top-level window, or the child window with keyboard focus) restores focus to Chrome but makes keyboard focus jump to the address bar at the top
* Using `win32process.AttachThreadInput(hwnd, hwnd_my_app, True)` followed by `win32gui.SetFocus(hwnd)` (and subsequently detaching the thread input again) does not restore focus to Chrome at all (again, `hwnd` is either the top-level window or the child window with focus)

I'm using `GetGUIThreadInfo(0, byref(gui))` to get info on the foreground thread into a `GUITHREADINFO` struct, and reading the `hwndFocus` entry of that struct to get the handle of the currently-keyboard-focused window.

Any help?

<TEXT> So my SL35 cleric just beat Sen's. I'm sitting at the Anor Londo bonfire with enough souls to go to 40.

I'm in the level-up screen, and I'm looking at how increasing Faith would affect two weapons I have: a +2 divine Estoc, and an unupgraded Astora's Straight Sword.

Currently, my Estoc is at 86+6 physical and 105+17 magical. If I increase Faith by 1, magic bonus damage goes up to +19. A second point makes it +21.

A *third* point makes it +22, and *increases* my physical bonus damage to +7. A fourth point reverts it to +6.

What the glob?

Astora's is even weirder. It's sitting at 80+23/80+13. One point increases magic bonus damage by 1. A second point increases it by 2 and *decreases* physical damage bonus by 1, where it stays even if I put more points into Faith.

<TEXT> I'm trying to get a handle to the window that currently has keyboard focus. At first, I tried `GetForegroundWindow()`, but I realised soon enough that the handle returned by this doesn't necessarily correspond to who has keyboard focus - specifically, it gives me the top-level window that's active, but not a handle to the child window with focus.

I then tried `GetFocus()`, but it's returning a null result and I think this is why (from MSDN docs, emphasis mine):

 Retrieves the handle to the window that has the keyboard focus, **if the window is attached to the calling thread's message queue**.

I don't understand these concepts too well. I get that there's a message queue which passes things around like WM_PASTE, but I thought the message queue belongs to the OS, not to specific windows. And threads are something with which I have no experience.

It's starting to look like I'll have to hack together several API calls just to get a dumb ol' handle to the currently-focused window, but that seems dumb. Surely there's a single function I could call that will give me what I want?

Any aid appreciated.

<TITLE> A new type of challenge </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-27 23:15:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Dark Souls is immersive like few other games I've played. But if there's one mechanic that detracts from that, it's the 'carry around awesome gear for every possible situation and change armour in ~5 seconds' nonsense.

To fix this, I introduce to you the **Ultimate adventurer challenge run**.

Rules:

* You can only equip or unequip items at a bonfire.
* You must decide ahead of time what gear and spells you want to use. In the event that some of those items are not available, you can temporarily substitute whatever is available. You can only replace a substitute with a nearer substitute. This is harder to define but it's up to you. (Example: if your final weapon is to be a Gargoyle's Halberd, you might use a Battle Axe to start with, then trade up to a Halberd. You may not switch down from the Halberd to the Battle Axe.)
* If you obtain an item that is part of your target build, you must equip it the next time you visit a bonfire *and* have enough carrying capacity that it won't put you over 100%.

The aim is to kit your character out like someone who has to travel on foot and fight, and stick to that loadout. So either you plan to use Havel's set from the very beginning, or you can forget about just plopping it on for Four Kings.

Additional details:

* Descending and re-enchanting weapons is not allowed! If you want a divine hammer for skeleton bashin', you have to include that in your build from the get-go.
* If a weapon breaks, you may not equip something else 'just until I can get to the bonfire'. That's why you get four weapon slots.

Optional rules:

* Swopping rings as needed doesn't quite strain suspension of disbelief so much. You may choose to allow swopping one or both ring slots as needed; after all, some areas in the game require use of specific rings. You may still only change rings at a bonfire.
* Spells are also arguably something that might change with the situation. However, I recommend against this rule; it alters the spellcasting game quite a lot, making high Attunement suddenly a lot more attractive.
* Hotbar items are quite situational. You may allow all (or perhaps some) slots to be changeable at a bonfire.
* You might want to allow using a light source just for the Tomb. I don't think you should - it's perfectly doable even if you can't see - but this is your challenge run, after all.

In closing: think like an adventurer who doesn't want to carry around tons of loot. And if you plan to do this challenge run, post your build up front and let us know how it goes. :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why did Renaissance dueling swords evolve almost exclusively into thrusting weapons? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-17 17:51:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The Medieval arming sword was used for both cutting and thrusting. The later spada de lato and espada ropera were similarly balanced, though they perhaps canted somewhat towards thrusting attacks rather than cutting. Wikipedia says the spada de lato was "ideal for handling the mix of armored and unarmored opponents of [the late 16th century]."

At the time the rapier evolved from the aforementioned swords, armour usage was in decline due to the proliferation of firearms; and in a civilian duel, your opponent was unlikely to be armoured anyway.

However, my understanding has been that cutting attacks are more effective against unarmoured foes, and thrusting attacks are more effective against armoured foes. (Support for this claim includes: shamshirs used mostly for slashing at unarmoured foes; the Polish army adopting the szabla in response to their enemies not using much heavy armour; estocs being developed solely to deal with heavily-armoured opponents.)

Why, then, did the rapier (and the small sword, and other dueling swords of the 16th century and later) evolve as a thrusting weapon, when in fact the targets it was intended for were virtually all unarmoured?

EDIT: Thanks for all the illuminating answers so far, everyone! I will respond to all when I have time. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was wikiing the names of Gwyn and his children because I was kind of curious what they meant.

The name Gwyn means "white" or "blessed" in Welsh   Cornish. This is pretty straightforward: Gwyn is the "lord of lords", and also the Lord of Sunlight, so the association is clear.

Gwyndolin means "white/blessed ring/bow", which could be taken to be a reference to the Moon (as in a white crescent). (A tongue-in-cheek bonus: the guy's pretty fond of rings, giving you one as himself and another as Gwynevere, and requiring a third to encounter him in the first place.)

But best of all is Gwynevere. Gwynevere means "white/blessed fay/ghost/enchantress". Her name is straight up telling you she's not real!

<TITLE> Catching system-wide hotkey while using Tkinter </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm trying to register a system-wide hotkey using pywin32 that will trigger some action in my Tkinter program. I'm using [this](http://timgolden.me.uk/python/win32_how_do_i/catch_system_wide_hotkeys.html) as reference. When I run the code from that link, it works fine. What I'm struggling with is integrating the loop there with the event loop in Tkinter.

The Tkinter loop needs to periodically check for the hotkey being pressed. This should be trivial, using `root.after()`. However, the program doesn't seem to pick up on the hotkey being pressed at all, not even when it's in focus.

[Here is a succinct code example](https://gist.github.com/subject998/a5541d5b3dbc7573aecc) - it's as short as I could get it. It represents my attempts to modify the code from the link to play nicely with Tkinter.

One quirk I've noticed is that if I set the first argument of `root.after()` to zero, the GUI doesn't draw correctly and Python sometimes ends up crashing.

EDIT: It turns out I had a typo! `ord("v")` should have been `ord("V")`. D'oh. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Trying to implement system-wide shortcut key on Windows </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-25 23:29:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm writing a tool in Python 3.3 using tkinter. I want to implement a keyboard shortcut - say, WIN+Z - that will open the main window and give it focus, even when the app is minimised or does not have focus.

I've Googled the problem, and the only thing I can find is a function in wxPython called [RegisterHotKey](http://wiki.wxpython.org/RegisterHotKey). This seems to be what I am looking for (if we ignore the issue of whether the Windows key counts as a modifier), but I'm hoping to achieve the same in tkinter rather than abandoning what I've done so far.

What strikes me as interesting about the wxPython example in the link is that it uses pywin32 "for the VK keycodes"; this suggests to me that the keycodes could be made available to tkinter in the same way; however, as far as I can tell, tkinter's Tk() class does not contain a method similar to RegisterHotKey.

Any help?

EDIT: I just found [this](http://timgolden.me.uk/python/events.html) which seems like it offers half the answer, but I don't understand it well and would appreciate some enlightenment.

EDIT 2: From the same site as the above link, it seems I've found my answer! [Catch system-wide hotkeys](http://timgolden.me.uk/python/win32_how_do_i/catch_system_wide_hotkeys.html). Now I just need to figure out how to integrate that behaviour into tkinter's main loop. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Decent Engi B run, don't wanna mess up, need weapon advice </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> http://imgur.com/a/ob9sh

I'm giving Engi B a shot, because I'm trying to unlock all the ships. I've heard nothing but complaints on this sub about how crap the ship is, but I've been extremely lucky so far.

I am right in the beginning of sector 5, playing on Normal difficulty, AE.

Here's the situation: I have a decent amount of scrap, and I've hit a store that is selling one each of Ion Blast, Ion Blast II, and Heavy Ion. I'm rocking a Heavy Ion and two Heavy Lasers, with no combat drones. That loadout performed very well when enemies had one shield, adequately when they had two, and now I'm starting to run up against enemies with three shield bubbles and even with hacking, it's tough breaking through (and that's if they don't shoot down my hacking drone etc).

However, I'm lacking crew. I actually already bought one of the crew the shop was offering (a Slug with shield   combat experience), which brings me up to... two crew. :/ I lost two crewies in a pretty bad fight a few jumps back. I still have my two starting drones, and I haven't been able to justify selling them since I'm so short-staffed.

So my question, reddit, is: what do I buy/sell? What will give me the best chance at survival here?

If we need to specify goal priorities, my first goal would be to reach sector 8, and beating the flagship is a close second. So if it comes down to balancing the best chance of surviving to the last sector vs actually beating the flagship, I'm inclined to choose survival.

The gun lover in me wants to swap out a Heavy Laser for another Ion weapon, hopefully one that can stack nicely with the Heavy Ion. But I've never really had the opportunity to really test-drive multiple Ion weapons so I don't know if that's a worthwhile choice. Basically, I don't really see another way to increase my firepower at this junction; by 'firepower', I mean 'ability to actually crack through shields'.

I'm *also* tempted to try switching out the Heavy Ion for a Ion Blast II; I get the sense from [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/1xjb1q/can_anyone_explain_in_detail_how_ion_weapons_work/) thread that an Ion Blast II on its own will fire fast enough to actually accumulate damage.

TL;DR: look pictures. see shop. wat buy </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys. I'm trying out this LP thing. I don't have $$$ for stuff so I'm using what I have/what I can find for free:
- Loilo Game Recorder
- Virtual Audio Cable
- Alesis io2 interface (similar to an Mbox)
- Shure SM58
- Sennheiser HD-280

If I don't use VAC, everything works just fine, with the one exception that my recorded VO is only in the left channel. Since Loilo mixes everything down to a stereo mix, I can't bring the VO out to both channels in post without ditching the right half of the stereo mix (which I'd rather keep).

I've gone back and forth with VAC trying to find settings that can somehow distribute my mic input to both channels, with no luck. Confusing the issue is that Loilo does some of its own internal routing (recording the default playback device's output into the file along with the default recording device's).

What I *think* I need to do is set a VAC as the default recording device, then somehow use VAC and/or Audio Repeater to pipe the mic's input into both channels of said VAC, but I can't figure out how to do this.
