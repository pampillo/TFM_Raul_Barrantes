<TEXT> I hD an idea for a way to start my new campain. Basically i tell my players to roll level 15 characters and we start fighting the bbeg second in comand. When they come close to winning the real bbeg teleports in, teleports the players away and strips them of gear. They basically revert back to level 1. From there they have to work there way back up, recruit npcs to help with the final battle and such like. Im worried that people will hate me for givig them so much power in the first session and then taking it away and that theyll leave straight after. What do you all think? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The story was one of my party, a crazy monk, went to a woodworker and asked to see his greatest work. This turned out to be a ornate desk in the townmasters office. The desk didnt fot through the door so they had to dismantle it to carry it. The 2 of them carried it to the shop but the keeper recognised it. Refused to buy. They qent out and the monk carved his name into it and went in and bluffed his way into awllig it dor 250 gold. It was a nice desk. There was also goblin ears and a scared mayor  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So im starting a campaign as dm this weekend and ny group has no healer. To combat this i was considering throwing an item in for them fairly early on. The item is: Jims 6 figered glove of healing.
It gives the wearer a less powerful version of lay on hands, being 2x total level rather than 5x paladin level. It also makes the wearer grow a sixth figer. Requires attunement otherwise everythig you do that uses your hands has disadvantage. You also have to roll a d100 once a day for a chance of an npc to appear who is hunting the six fingered man who killed his father. If he finds you, you gotta scrap or reason your way out. 

My question is do you think this is a good idea? I think that it will help my players feel a little safer and add some fun! I arent sure on balancing though and not sure if its too weak or anything </TEXT>

<TEXT> Iv walked in that area for years. Im a yorkshire lad born and bred. I was foolish that day. Had my phone with the map on it and a bottle of water and some sandwitches. Everything else was with my tent at the pub. I was stupid and left the path and completely lost my bearings. I couldnt find north and my phone map was useless to me. When it got dark i used ny phone for the torch. I phoned the police about 20% and told them all i could see was a fence. They said to follow it so i did. I aparently followed it the wrong way, going further into the moors than out. Once it got too dark to be safe i could sdo nothing but lay down in a bit of a depression to get out of the wind. Puull my hood up, hands in pockets and try to sleep. Rose with the sun and started movig again. The blasted grouse kept laughing at me! It was entirely my own fault for being ill prepared and thinking i knew what i was doing. In hind sight, without the stress, it was a bloody good walk. I found an old mine entrance, a new trig point and an old building of some sort the had crumbled. Sought shelter there for a while. I proved i could do it to myself whih is good. I wish i hadnt had to though. And i cant stop kicking myself for being so stupid </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually found search and rescue in the end. They had stopped for some lunch by a trig point. I was waiting by the trig point as you know, high ground for the helicopter. We was basically about 100 yards away from one another for a while until i heard a laugh carry on the wind. I started yelling and looking for them, eventually stumbled across them. They gave me a mars bar and some water. I was lucky in that it was a very mild night for a january. I had to sleep in nothing but the clothes in my back. When i had been fed and watered they gave me the choice of walking out or a helicopter lift out. I felt well enough to walk so did the 6km or so walk to the nearest point, a pub. (Tan hill inn, highest pub in britain). I was examined in an ambulance and questioned by the police. I suffer from depression so my home was searched for a suicide note by the police  some of my vitals where wonky so was questioned about any substance use. I was more or less fine other than being cold, tired, hungry and thirsty. It was really rather scary and people thought if i was found, is be found dead </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi I'm looking for a weekend raiding guild EU, I'm willing to server transfer and faction change if necessary. I have a priest and a druid both 840+ and I'm competent at all roles, beat at healing and tanking though. I work shifts so cannot commit to anything during the week so need a weekend raid time </TEXT>

I aren't raiding properly, only 1 of 3 nights a week and I am barely putting any hours in due to work so won't be competitive anymore anyway.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm wanting to properly perk up my gear for dps and was wandering what the best set up for perks is? I found this list.

Weapon = precise 5   Aftershock 3

Armor 1 = Biting 3, impatient 3/devoted 3

Armor 2 = Crackling 3, absorbtive 


Some of the perks overlap, such as precise and devoted comi from arms components and impatient and devoted from zamorak components. So I was wandering what the best thing to do would be? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-06-12 15:59:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Iv tried to build a mob spawner near my base, iv built a room with 0 light, most caves near by are all lit and I'm stood about 20 to 25 blocks away. But nothing is spawning. Iv built the same size room on a creative world and it spawns a lot of mobs. The only difference I can find is that the survival one is made of clay and the creative is quartz. Any suggestions as to why nothing is spawning?

edit: some screen shots that hopefully help...

<TEXT> Fellow rs vet here, played about 12 years myself. My biggest thing g is the difference in quests. Runescapes quests are vastly superior to wow quests. I find wow quests to be all the same, just different locations where as the rs ones are all different. Plus, quests on wow are probably the best way to level a new character, almost necessary, where as, again, rs isn't.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Problem with someone in my group </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-21 23:07:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Iv just had my first session with a new group from roll20 today, went pretty good except for 1 person. I have described his actions to myself as backseat dming. 

My problem is I found him too bossy and obnoxious. He never let anyone else speak and kept trying to make peoples decisions for them. At one point he was moving everyone's tokens to where he wanted them without asking. The DM did change it so we could only move our own tokens after that. 

He was also telling people to roll for certain things and taking over telling the story from the DM. Basically he kinds ruined it for me. Does anyone have any advice on what I can do about this? Is this normal behaviour and I'm just over reacting? Please help! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> OK so just a month ago now I had an emergency ileostomy due to a bowel perforation and had peritonitis and a 3 day coma and a generally rough time. Iv been home about 2 weeks now and starting to think about becoming more active when I am fully healed. I'm having s bit of a problem with security though, I.e. I think my stoma is quite high and I don't know what to do with it in public. How will it hold up to cycling and swimming and running and stuff? What about walks where there will be no access to toilets all day? 

I'm sorry for a bit of a text wall but I kinda feel like I have no one I can talk to and have no idea what I'm doing and frankly I am terrified </TEXT>
