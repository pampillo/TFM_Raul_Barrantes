<TEXT> Yes.
We dated on and off for two years. It took him a very long time to be open with it, and once I realised, it became more obvious to me he needed help which he would not seek. 
There was a lot of deceitful things on his behalf and was the end of our relationship. 
He cheated on me with his ex, to whom he was engaged to before he went into the military. I think in the end he was trying to get the life he had back before the military.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Going to cut a long story short. 
Recently started dating a new guy (we are doing long distance, and I see him on the weekend), when I was at his house this weekend I noticed something was a bit off, and it clicked that a few of his paintings were missing. I asked him about it, and he told me his ex came and picked them up Tuesday (I noticed they were gone Sunday), he didnt mention to me that she had gone around to pick them up, and so I asked him about it, and he kept trying to avoid the conversation. 
This isnt the first time the there has been something with his ex, once again, long story short. I was at his friends first birthday, when all the boys got drunk as anything, and I was left with the girls (including his ex), this was my first time meeting them all, and to say it was awkward was the least. I was left with her for 7 hours. She ended up talking to me about her mum and their problems. At the end of the night when i'd had enough, and couldnt hold myself together, I asked to leave and we spoke about it in the car, to which he said he didnt know she was going, but she had told me that night, she'd messaged him saying she was going. 
I dont want to get in to deep with this guy if he is still talking to his ex. 
My head says give it a bit longer and see what happens, my heart says I really really like him, but my gut is saying im going to get really hurt. 
HELP. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Ladies! 
I live in Mildura, VIC, and I cant get NYX here. 
Was on their website and was thinking of purchasing a few things, but it says i've got to sign up with some company who will give me a US address and then it gets forward to me. 
After reading that I decided I wouldnt purchase what was in my cart. 
So I was wondering if anyone has brought of there before and can tell me its a safe way to get NYX, or where I can get some? 
I will be in Adelaide in a couple weeks if I can get some there? </TEXT>

My 8 year old self, turned to him and said in an outside voice, "JUST SHUT UP! IM TRYING TO WATCH SHREK", he turned around and said "Why dont you shut up, no one wants to watch it anyway". And with all my little girl anger I slapped him across the face. Unknown that the teacher was watching, walked over and told the boy to take a walk, and gave me a lolly pop and said that if he was my age, would have done the same thing.  </TEXT>

How much you use will depend on length and thickness. 
I pop it on my hair, twist and clip my hair down, and then put a shower cap over and leave for about 2-4 hours. 
The important bit, wash it out with organic shampoo and conditioner first, then wash your hair with the everyday shampoo and conditioner you use.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As much as I hated deleting him of facebook - It needed to happen. 
Its not like its was an immature move, I just know it would have been harder for the both of us. 
Like I would have hated to see him with his new gf (who he cheated on me with), that would have been heart breaking at the time. 
Its funny you mention moving down, because as soon as I was told I wasnt keeping my job, I decided to move to the same state as him. He wasnt happy about that (obviously didnt want me to find out about his other girlfriend). Cracks in the relationship formed which lead to the breakup, and then a few weeks later me finding out he was cheating. 
As shit of a week as it was, fuck I am glad it happened. Imagine staying with him longer and not knowing about the other girl. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Recovery for me was actually quite easy. 
I was able to pick up a job within a few days after it all, and i'd never had a job like that as such, there was so much learning to do, and I hardly ever got a moment to myself as the workload was so big. Which worked in my favor, as in previous breakups, i'd dwell on everything that went wrong and how I could have fixed it. 
I removed and blocked all social media, deleted contact information for him and his family members, deleted photos, you name it, it was gone. I needed to focus on myself, and not on him, so when I did this, I had no way to check up on him. I didnt remember his phone number, so I couldnt text or ring him. I literally had no way to contact him. Best decision I made. 
And lastly, I realized i'd fallen in love and comfortable within the relationship, not actually the person I was with. I was traveling back and forth from one state to another every weekend for 7 months, going from country town to big city. Once in the city, i'd be going out for dinner to different restaurants each night, going to cute little cafes to grab coffee, and finding tucked away bar/lounges and catching up with friends and making new. It was the ideal life style for me. Once I realized that I was happy being comfortable and not actually happy, my world just turned 360 and it was the one thing that kicked the breakup into overdrive.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know this feeling, all too well. 
When my ex and I broke up, I was devastated. 
It took me about 3 months and accepting an apology that I never will get, to realized, I missed the life I was living with him.
Living in the country and going to stay with him in the city every weekend, being able to go out and do extravagant things and do so much in a day and a half because thats all the time we had with each other each week. Being in social scenes I could only dream about, the whole 9 yards.
It sucks.

Its funny though, because I had a weird feeling it was happening but dismissed it because he would always be so kind. 
Sometimes we need to go with our gut, like you said, before shit hits the fan! 
Whilst he has never admitted to it, I have been told from a few of his friends that something happened behind me back. 
I dont hate him, he taught me so much about myself and life. I always speak highly of him because I wouldnt be the person I am without him.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No me, but my mother. 
She says the only thing keeping her alive is knowing that her family loves her no matter what. 
I noticed you said you live in a small town, so do we. 
My mum self diagnosed herself by researching all her symptoms on the internet, after printing of something like 60 pages and taking them to the doctor, she was able to be put through to a specialist who confirmed what she had found to be true.   
She has depression but wont admit. Its hard for her, not being able to work anymore is the worst thing for her. She says that she feels like a burden because our family only has one source of incomes. 
We dont go on holidays anymore because of her illness. She cant do many day to day tasks like the average person. Im just rambling a bit here, but its hard for her, and for us. Its not easy to watch your hero go through pain day after day and not do anything to help. 
I asked my mum your question, and this is her answer to you. 
"Hi Tomqvaxy, its not easy having an illness, once you have it, all you want to do is get better, and you cant. That is the worst thing about it. If you have a supporting family who is there for you every waking minute of the day, it will be easier to live with. Just know that there is help out there for you, and what ever you can get, take it. I wish you all the best with things, and please feel free to talk to either me or subject3414 at any time."

Hope this gives you a bit of help. Inbox me anytime you need a chat. 
Sending my wishes your way.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It has gotten better with time, but im actually thankful its happened, because whilst my anxiousness is better, there are sometimes where the anxiousness and hesitation has really paid off! A few times at a round-about, i've thought I've got enough time to go, but this guy looks like he is traveling pretty fast, so I might wait a extra few seconds, and sure enough, they are, and for all I know, it could have been a life saving decision.  
I must say though, my accident only gave me really bad whiplash, and soreness around my arms and back from the impact, so I wasnt in that bad of a shape, my dad made me get in the car the day after it happen and drive him to work. It was the hardest thing i've ever done. I broke down crying 3 times and had to pull over.  </TEXT>

Im focusing more on my fitness and health, and starting to study which I did not do much off during my schooling years. 
My Uncle has been the most supportive has none of his kids decided to join the Australian Defense Force, and knowing that his niece is joining in his honor and to try and start a tradition of keeping our family name i n the ADF has made him extremely proud, and I dont think there can be a better feeling then having your family proud of you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mother is disabled, she has a walking stick, but when she has a 'bad day', she will use a walking frame. She gets dirty looks all the time. My mum puts a lot of effort into her appearance, it will take her 3 hours to get ready of a daily basis because of her disease, she has to take a lot of breaks, hence the long time. People see her and think shes looks fine, why does she get disabled parking, and why does she have a walking stick. 
It was hard for me to grow up with people constantly giving her dirty looks and so on, I am a person who does not put up with peoples shit, so if someone gave/gives her a look, the only thing I do is give them a dirty look, as my mother taught me to not let they get to me. 
There has been a few times where I have let loose on people. 
The worst time was when I was younger, around 16yrs old and acting out, a boy (roughly 16yr old) was with his mother, saw my mum and went up to her,  he kicked the walking stick out from my mum, she fell, and they ran away laughing. I ran over, pushed one of the kids down, and kicked him in the nuts, I walked up to his mother and told her I hope her kids balls drop of so he doesn't reproduce another pathetic asshole like himself. One of the staff members ran to my mums help, while I kicked the kid. Everytime we go to the that store, man who helped my mum, still helps her today. Its good to know some people out there really do care about others. 
So thats my side of it. 
On the other hand for my dad, its hard for him. He gets embarrassed by mum having to use a walking stick, and wheelchair/walking frame. 
He wants to live life to the fullest before he gets old, but is unable to because of mum. So its hard of him. Also he is the main provider for the family as my mum is unable to work. He has a job but is on casual employment due to the wages being better, which is good and bad. Wages are better, but it means if he gets sick and doesnt get a full weeks work of shifts, there are days without pay. 
My brother and I pitch in with bills and what not, but our parents hate it when we do, as they feel they cant provide a good life for us. 
Its hard on all of us. 

Good luck with it all, I hope your SO gets better soon. </TEXT>

I am living in Australia and looking at traveling abroad for a year. 
Given we are both Australians, I thought you might be a better person to talk to this about. I have a few questions to ask, I hope you dont mind.
I dont have much money saved at all, how much money did you have saved up before you went overseas? Were you able to work overseas to make a bit of extra cash? Where abouts did you go? Did you stay in mostly hostels, if so, what were they like? Would you recommend anywhere in particular to go? Did you ever find yourself worried or lost in a place where it was unsafe? Did you go alone, if so, how was it, would you have preferred for someone to go with you?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I could only hope something like that would go down smoothly with her, but I have a strange feeling it wouldnt. 
I remember her from my high school days, she has no idea who I am, but she has always been this way. 
She is one of those people who puts downs others to make herself feel better. 
I just dont have the time for people like this, but its so hard when you have to work with them on a daily basis!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know the problem!! 
I have long, thick, wavey/bird nesty hair, and I use to loose a lot of hair every day! 
Brushing my hair was the worst, I wouldn't have knots but it still took a lot of strans out. And washing my hair was horrible, I would just get my fingers tangled as I was scrubbing. My mum was having to vacuum the bathroom everyday because there was so my hair everywhere. 
Now I loose basically nothing. 
What stopped it? Super greens and essitial vitamins! 
My hair doesn't come out, only when I get the occasional few strands but that's it :) 
Also it makes my nails nice and strong and grow fast too!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Berry Blast Sorbet Thingy!! 
So quick, so easy! 
I've never done actual measurements, I go buy what I like, but this is what I use: 

1kg Greek Yoghurt 
1kg frozen mixed berries 
3 table spoons of raw extracted honey 
2 table spoons of water 

I put all the above amounts in the processor and evenly distribute in a few containers. So depending on what portions you want, you'll use different ingredient quantities. 

I do this in the morning and let set in the freeze all day until later on in the night! Take out and eat! So simple!! 

You can also take it out early and eat like ice cream as well!  </TEXT>

Most memorable was when I was on a holiday, around 16/17 years old, I was wearing a singlet and some guy yell out "are your tits real or fake? if they are real, nicest and biggest tits ive seen". 
So awkward for the fact my mum was next to me.

<TEXT> All girls will get intimidated by good looking men, but it depends on how the man carries himself. If he is humble and nice, and doesnt focus on his looks, knowing he looks good, there is somewhat of intimidation, but it will be easier for a woman to approach them.
If a man is very arrogant about his looks, unless the girl is extremely attractive and confident with herself, most people wont go near them.

It took me a while to trust guys again. But right now im with someone who treats me the way every girl deserves to be treated. 
Everyday he makes me feel like a princess.
Not once in my last relationship did I ever feel love in the slightest, now I get random phone calls and message all throughout the day just him telling me he how much he loves me. 
I am really lucky, I even think i've found 'the one'.  </TEXT>

I also have depression, and only my boyfriend knows. I dont want to tell my mother because she is severely disabled, and she herself struggles with day to day life. I dont think I can ever come clean to her and let her know I have depression, I think it would only make life worse for her, and I know she will blame herself because she cant be like other mums.

<TEXT> Well I'm going to guess your father is sick, and may be near the end of his time, so ask him, what is the last thing he wants to do with this life, before its too late, and then he will be satisfied. 
As for your mother, who seems like the most loving mother to continue to work to support your sister at a late age is beautiful, once again, ask her what she wants to do, something that will make everything in her life worth living for. 
As for your sister, that is a hard situation, she has done this to herself, and its sad to hear has and still continues to struggle, I not really to sure what she can do. 
Hope things get better soon.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends who you are.
When its someone who is good looking, my first thought is "oh my god, is my makeup okay? Do I look fat in this? Fuck I hope not. Is there something on my face? Oh god I look horrible, why today, do someone good looking have to be checking me out".
But lets say I dont find you attractive, and I put in an effort to look good, I really like that, gives me confidence and makes me feel good. 
The slide clances are always good, or if someone checks you out and they smile at you when you look at them, its a nice feeling.
But yeah, can go both ways.  </TEXT>

It's amazing how when we feel low, that going on Reddit and having complete strangers wish you a Happy Birthday can make you feel better hey..

Never forget that you are an amazing person.
Happy Birthday my fellow Redditor :)

<TEXT> No matter how you tell her, she is going to hate your guts and probably be super mean/angry. 
It seems as if you are ~~an idiot~~ only young, and have none or little experience with a girl. 
Dude, you got to man the fuck up. You need to pull her aside during a lunch time and tell her straight to her face, what the situation is. 
Just explain to her something along the lines of: Hey (whatever her name is), I need to tell you something, whilst I think you are a really nice girl and all, I have to admit, this has gone further than I anticipated. By giving you my number, I just thought we were going to be friends and nothing more. Whilst your feelings for me have developed, mine for you have not. I think you are an amazing girl, who is so nice, and genuine, but I cannot go out with you, as I dont want to lead you on any more than I have" 
I am a girl, and if I was in this situation, i'd want nothing more than honesty. Do that right thing, and she will ~~still hate you~~ understand.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My ex and I did a long distance relationship. 
We would watch youtube videos together and make sure we started them at the same time. 
We would play counterstrike together and go on a team so it felt like we were at a lan kinda thing.
Sometimes we would just do our on thing when we were on skype as if we were at one another house, like he was sitting there playing his xbox whilst I was reading a book, no words were said, but we could see what ever other was doing and whatever, it felt so good.
Unfortunately he found it difficult to handle to having that physical relationship of being able to have ~~sex~~ cuddle, kiss, and just play fight around. 

What I would have loved was to have random surprises, like by sending little things, even if its a piece of paper with "I love you" written on it. Because you live so far apart, she will love it so much because it was the thought and effort you put in it to make her smile.
When you do meet up and spend time together at either house, leave a thousand little notes tucked around her house for her to randomly find once she is gone, it will give her the biggest smile ever!! 

I wish you luck with the long distance, I hope everything works out for you and your girlfriend.  </TEXT>

I live by this quote and read it about 3 times a day (I have stuck it to a wall in my office)
" Your time is limited, dont waste it living someone else's life.
Dont be trapped by dogma, which is living the result of other peoples thinking.
Dont let the noise of others opinion drown your own inner voice.
And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition, they somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary."

And i'll be honest, i'd judged you when I was reading it, thinking yeah this guy is a massive snob who has too much money. 
But you dont seem like that at all, so i'm sorry for judging. 

Living in the country is amazing, whilst you can miss out on somethings, I feel its better, when you go on holidays everything seems so amazing compared to where you live. For me going on holidays to Melbourne is like oh my god! SO big, but for others its not.

Unfortunately for her, she is going to be in pain at the fact you are moving away and dont want the realtionship, when she does.
I did a long distance relationship. They are shit. And I dont know one person who has been in one that has worked out.
The odds are near impossible to keep the relationship from failing.

I dated someone for two years who was absuive, nasty and a very horrible person, with an even more horrible of a family. 
His mother physically absued me many times, along with her son (who I dated). At first it was all omg he is amazing perfect guy raddy rah, it took two weeks to make me realise he was scum. Why two weeks? Because thats when he rapped me. I tried telling my friends asking them for help, and they were all like he is amazing you are lying. So I lost my friends. All of them. I had no confidence what so ever, it took me a very long time until I finally got the courage to stand up and say you are a horrible person, and I dont want to be with you.

<TEXT> 
My mum is disabled and has been for around 11 years now.
The disease she has, 9/10 people kill themselves with as it is that painful and debilitating. 
A lot of talk around my house is to do with the pain she goes through, the money we spent of her medical bills and what not.
I am 19 years old, so most of my life I have been around a lot of medical talk, financial struggle, doctors visits, hospital visits etc. 

The best thing I find helps me get through the whole ordeal is writing things on paper, and then just burning them or throwing it away. It relives so much emotion, and I also listen to classical music when I write it. Strangely, it gives it so much more emotional relief.

With you wife, you need to get out the house as much as she is able to. Even if its going out for coffee in the morning and then stroll around the town till you have had enough. 
Keep her and your mind busy, do little things, plant a tree in the garden, board games, watch movies etc..

The main thing though, reinsure her every day, no matter what the outcome, you love her always and you will stay and support her through thick and thin, because without support she wont survive.

I hope this helps you, I wish you and your wife the best of luck with the outcome. 
I'm here for you if you need a chat or anything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I have a strong passion for people who dont pay attention driving. 
The guy who hit me was using his phone whilst he had two kids in the back, both under the age of 5. 
It is disgusting to think that someone is that careless about their own child's safety along with others on the road. 

It now gives me more passion to become a police officer and help stop people like this.  </TEXT>

I really like the idea of keep telling myself that others and I are good drivers, if i put my faith in them and myself that should help.

<TITLE> Reddit, I was involved in my first car accident yesterday. How did you over come the fear of getting back in the drivers seat?  </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-08-30 04:48:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Yesterday, driving home from work, I was stopped at an intersection, when someone ran into my car, hitting me at 55kms/per hour, making my car a right off, and having not one dint on the guy who it me cars.
I'd only had the car for 3 weeks, it was my first car, paid a fair enough for it, and now its completely destroyed.

I ended up going to hospital for a few hours, and have been told I have sever whiplash.
I'm so scared to drive again, I was in the car with my brother today who was helping me with organise things with the insurance company, and at each intersection I screamed because I thought the person behind wasnt going to stop. 

EDIT: Spelling 

Is there anything I should know or do, to help me get over this fear?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a difference between confidence and cockyness. Mate note of that. 
But confidence is something that attracts women. I myself, love when a guy has confidence, but if its they are over confident you look like an asshole. 
When we see a man who is confident, it shows us that are they are going to make the first move, so say if something was to happen between you and a women, if you have low confidence, she (unless ballsy as fuck) may come up to you and be like "hey whats up" or whatever, whereas we want that to be the guy who comes up and says "hey im ___ and i just wanted to say you look really nice today" or something simple like that to start of the conversation. 
Any girl will continue a conversation, if you have the confidence to go up and start talking to her genuinely.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did A LOT of weird shit when I was little.
So here are a couple that stick out to me.

Around the rip old age of 3, I was at home watching tv by myself eating my sandwich, whilst my mum was outside in the garden. So here I am, cute little me watching Play School all la dee da, when the old guy 'Greg' comes on, and I did not like Greg, so I decided to pull my peanut butter sandwich appart and stick it on Gregs face so I didnt have to look at him, when the camera angle changed i would just smear the sandwich around the tv, causing the tv to have peanut butter and bread all over it.

Another time, once again around the age of three, i was playing in the bath with my navy boat that you could pull in half and it hand little navy seal men inside. I'm playing in the bath, have a good old time, when I needed to fart, so I farted, few bubbles come up, I giggle and continue playing, when all the sudden I notice a little bit of poo floating around. So what do I do, pull my boat in half and trap my poo, why I dont know, but I did. Got out the bath and left my poo in there, it wasnt untill my brother (6 at the time) had a bath and pulled the boat apart to realise there was a little surpise left for him. 

Another time, when renovating our house, there was a massive pile of brown dirt in our backyard, I was at the age of about 5-6, and at this time I had a fascination with getting naked and running around the backyard. So when the renovations were happening, there were a lot of trades men in the backyard working on the extension, I came home from kinder early, to find the pile of dirt was still there, what do I do, strip of ALL my clothes, butt naked, and pretend i'm a dog and dig in the dirt, infront of all the tradies. Worst thing, my mum filmed it.

TL;DR- smudged peanut butter on the tv because I didnt like the guy on tv, trapped a piece of poo in a toy boat, and stipped of in front of trades men and played in the dirt.  </TEXT>

But I thin you need to cut your hair a bit shorter than shoulder length, so you focus on doing that for a start. 
You have beautiful big eyes, if you use some mascara and eyeliner, with a small amount of a neutral colored eye shadow, you will bring them out 10000x's more!

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Regrettably for tea last night, I had curry, and today I sure as hell paid for it.
There was a workshop going on in our seminar room, and the students in the workshop had just gone back into the room after their lunch break, I thought this would be a great time to go give my bowels the workout that they so desperately craved. 
As I sat down, got comfortable, and relaxed, just about to drop a bomb when, I hear a noise, the sound of foot step coming towards me, with each step I clenched my asshole tighter and tighter. For a second I couldnt hear anything. I thought yes, a false alarm, time to blow this shit outta my ass, just as Im about to realise the hounds, all the sudden the door swings opens. Never in my life, have I so quickly clamped each ass cheek together. The lady sits down, piss pots around in her stall, and then its quite. That awkward quite of I hope the lady next to me is going to leave, because I really need to poo type of quite. The anticipation of not knowing what to do was killing me, I have a volcano in my ass that is about to erupt, and this chick casually waiting for me to leave so she can do the same thing. When all the sudden, for the first time in my life, I heard another lady poo. But it wasnt any kind poo, this was like a euphoric type of poo. The sigh of relief the lady gave, my god, she was happy to drop her friends of to the pool thats for sure. But I myself was unsure of what to do, do I poo alongside with her? As I thought, it struck me, that it took her a lot of courage to make the first more, and I was impressed by that, so as good sportsmen do, I dropped my bomb as well, it was a strange feeling, but in a good way, knowing we were both releasing the shit from our bowels. As I walk out the stall I was in to wash my hands, the mysterious pooper arose from the stall next to me and says Didnt think I was going to make it, note to self, poo before and not after a bum fuck. I froze. This lady probably in her mid-teens had just got it on with some other student in during their lunch break. My reply was an awkward chuckle, whilst my face had wtf did I just hear written all over it. For the rest of the day, she kept giving me the sup nod.

<TEXT> The more genuine you are, the more likely we are going to be impressed. 
I had a guy come up to me at my last job, and I simply smiled at him at we walked past each other, and about 5 minutes later he came back and said "I just had to let you know that you have the prettiest smile I have ever seen."  We stood around and had a chat for about 15 minutes, he said he would like to see me again, sometime over coffee, and I kindly declined, as at the time I had a boyfriend. 
Long story short, be genuine, be kind, be calm, confident and be yourself and you'll be sure to get a reaction, unless the chick is a bitch, then she doesnt deserve you.

<TEXT> I know how you are feeling. 
I'm unable to Have any form of communication with my boyfriend for two weeks due to his work. It's only been a week, and it's been like hell each day and is only going to go worse with the next week coming. 
For me, it's so hard to stay positive, I find that I'm in such a negative state. I don't want to talk to anyone, don't want to do anything. I come home from work each day and just sit on my couch and hold back tears. I think it's so hard because I am use to having a Skype date each night and phone calls during the day, and then to have nothing all of the sudden, my goodness I can't describe me. 
Im now in the state where I'm begining to think if long distance is Going to work. Like do I ever get to be with him in the end? I love my job and the place I live so much, but there is nothing for him here job wise, so he wouldn't move to where I live. So what do I do? I feel like I'm somewhat in limbo waiting for a decision to be made. 

That's my rant, my story.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reading through your story, all I did was cry. 
The young boy you were, I am experiencing myself. 
And this is like looking into the future as if this was coming from my current boyfriend. He is exactly what you were. And on the Saturday just passed, i went out clubbing with my brother and his friend as a goodbye to our friend who was leaving, and I got somewhat drunk and kissed a guy. But I am yet to tell my boyfriend because I know how he will react, and he will never speak to me again. 
I dont know what to do, because know i have feelings for the man i kissed, because he is everything my current boyfriend is not. 
Please, if you see this, please comment, i really need help as to what i should do. 
Do i stay with my boyfriend who is now so overbearing that I hate myself for being inlove with him, or do I go for the man i kissed who gives me butterflys when i see he has sent me a text on my phone.
HELP. </TEXT>
