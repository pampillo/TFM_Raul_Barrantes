<TEXT> I just purchased a new gaming PC, and I'm in the process of re-installing all my games. I'd like to install the battle.net desktop app to manage all of my Blizzard games (Overwatch, Diablo, Hearthstone) from, but when I do a google search for battle.net desktop app and click on the appropriate link, it just redirects me to my account homepage.  What steps do I need to take to get the battle.net desktop app back?

<TITLE> What is r/buildapc's opinion of Microcenters Powerspec pre-built PC's? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-25 20:13:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm considering getting a new computer, and while browsing I came across Microcenter's powerspec PC line, and based on the parts used it seems like a great deal. 

The original one I was looking at was [this one](http://www.microcenter.com/product/473495/G419_Desktop_Computer), which is $1300 assembled, but when on PC part picker and attempting to build a similar machine I was getting $1450 minimum for the same parts, and often a bit higher.  (Don't have the PC part picker build, its on my home pc).

I also just saw [this machine](http://www.microcenter.com/product/475436/G350_Desktop_Computer) which also seems like a really good deal. 

Would looking at one of these machines be a good idea for my next buy? Looking to spend in the $1000-$1400 range. Machine will be used for gaming and programming. Will be looking for 1080p/1440p gaming.  I have a 1080p monitor I will use for a bit, it doesnt have freesync or gsync but it is serviceable for now, and I'll be looking to upgrade the monitor down the line.  </TEXT>

The problem is, is that in order to unlock it, after providing my basic info/ssn/etc, it is asking for an account number, which I have no way to access since I'm locked out of my account! Does anyone know if it's possible to get in touch with them over the weekend? I still need to put the money into my IRA account for 2016. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Writing my own indexer - Relational Database vs NoSQL DB vs Search Engine </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-10 19:37:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm thinking of writing my own indexer as a side project, but I'm not sure what type of data store to pick to hold it.  

My goal is to write a high performance general indexer that could then be used by other projects to write the data to the index, then they would write their own tools to access the data. I'm also considering writing connector libraries to easily provide a structured way to access the data in a variety of languages. 

Since I have no experience with the GGG API or handling data streams/searches in the fashion required for a stash index, I figured I would ask what design considerations I should keep in mind, based on experiences that you guys have had. 

The biggest area's of contention for me is I'm not sure if elasticsearch's added benefits are necessary compared to a NoSQL solution for storing the JSON data, and I'm not sure if the ACID guarantees provided by a relational table are necessary, or if the eventual consistency for a NoSQL store or elasticsearch will be fast enough for a general purpose index, given that it seems each change id adds about 1000 items (I read that on this forum somewhere but don't have a link to the post).

My goal is to also make the indexer easily extensible so that others can easily change what's being indexed/stored, which may be a bit difficult with a relational table if they are adding/removing fields.

<TITLE> Diablo 3 player trying out POE, have some questions </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-26 18:52:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've played a decent amount of Diablo 3, but I'm looking to give POE a try.  I'm at level 30 on my first ranger and its going ok-ish, but I have a bunch of questions about the game that aren't really answered in any of the new player guides I've read.  A lot of my questions will compare against Diablo 3 for reference, not because I'm hating on POE, but because it's the only game of the genre that I've played before.

Questions:

What are the gear/level benchmarks for this game? I.E., I started a seasonal D3 character a couple days ago and by level 20, I had had four legendary drops and was full yellow geared.  In comparison, on my level 30 ranger, I currently only have five yellow items (jewelry and 2 armor pieces), rest blues, with no unique drops.  At what points in POE (on average) should I be fully blue geared, fully yellow geared, and when should unique items start dropping?  

Loot drop rates: In D3, whenever I kill a blue pack, yellow monster or a unique, I usually get a blue or yellow drop.  However, in my experience with POE so far, over half of the yellow, blue and uniques I've killed have dropped no loot or just whites.  Have I just been super unlucky, or is loot just harder to come by in POE?  At what rate should I expect to get gear upgrades (on average)?

At what rate should I be receiving skill gems, and how should I be getting them?  In D3, you just get skills/runes/passives per level.  In POE so far, the only gems I've gotten have been from quest rewards, which can lead to long wait times, or sometimes from monster drops.  However, the majority of the drops have been unusable by my build.  How often should I be getting new skill gems, and are there other ways of acquiring them that I'm missing out on?

Is there a way to auto-scale the difficulty on the zones?  In D3, I can take my time and do all the content in an act and it will automatically scale it to me.  In one of the POE guides I read, it said to avoid doing content in zones where your character was more than 3 levels over the zone level.  Since I'm new to POE, I'm spending time doing all the optional quests, as well as having to usually clear most of each zone since I don't know the routes through it, which usually leads to me being 4-5 levels above that of the zone.  If there is not a way to scale the content and this happens, what should my course of action be to get back to zones that are my level? 

Is there a way to expand my inventory? I find myself wanting to pick up a lot of loot to sell, since I'm new to the game and have no currency, but I can usually only pick up 10ish pieces before I have to teleport back. 

EDIT: Thanks for your help all, all of my questions have been answered.   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For those of you that have basses with radically different pickup/preamp selections, how do you manage your live tone? 

Right now I have a BC rich warlock, which has two EMG musicman pickups with no active tone shaping, just an active preamp (two volumes and a tone knob). My second bass is an Ibanez which has Bart MK1s and a full active preamp with tone shaping. Both basses have different output levels so it makes trying to set up my signal chain to get a decent sound out of both of them difficult. A situation that another player might have is that they have an active bass and a passive bass and are trying to get good sounds out of both of them. 

How do you guys handle a situation like this? Some sort of level balancing pedal, multiple preamps with multiple feeds to FOH, single preamp and settle with a just OK sound? I'm looking for ideas on approaching this in a way that is friendly to the sound guy.

<TEXT> Hi all, currently sitting in my parents car in a parking lot while my mom ran into a store to buy a gift card for Christmas. A car pulled up in the spot next to my passenger door and the driver threw open his door, swinging into my closed passenger door and making a loud thud. He made no attempts to signal me or apologize in any way and walked into another store, and when I got out of the car to inspect it my parents car now has a dent in the side of the car. 

I am currently still in the parking lot next to the car. Should I call the police? Wait until the gentleman comes back and ask him for his insurance information? Is there something I should do now to ensure possible legal recourse? I'm not sure what I should do in this situation. Thanks  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys, just hit level 30 and have a couple of questions. I read the fresh 30 1.4 guide but these weren't covered. It basically boils down to being unsure about the credits/crafting endgame. 

Firstly, should I be disassembling or selling unwanted weapons? The guide didn't say if buying gear with weapons or if crafting was better. 

Secondly, should I spend credits on gear at all pre-229, or should I just stockpile them for once I hit 229? 

Lastly, what should I spend Phoenix credits on? Not sure what the most optimal buys are.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [mySQL] Problem with logs </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I'm having some trouble reading mySQL logs.  

The project I'm working on is using the Liferay Java web framework, and it auto generates some SQL queries.  We've been running into issues where in a couple cases its generating queries that are extremely large and slow, so I'm trying to debug them.  However, when I look in the SQL logs, I see stuff like this:

 "SELECT JournalArticle.id_ as id1_414_0_, JournalArticle.uuid_ as uuid2_414_0_, JournalArticle.resourcePrimKey as resource3_414_0_, JournalArticle.groupId as groupId414_0_, JournalArticle.companyId as companyId414_0_, JournalArticle.userId as userId414_0_,  [truncated, 1.6 KB total]"


The logs seem to be auto-truncating the query being logged, and its making it impossible to debug this issue.  Does anyone know how to make it so that SQL will log the whole query no matter what? I've tried looking through the log settings in mySqlWorkbench but I can't seem to find any setting relating to this issue. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How do you use you use stat tracking sites to get better? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've never really used stat tracking for any of the games I've played before so I'm not entirely sure what I should be looking for and how to use the stats to get better. Also, it seems like there are at least 3-4 stat popular stat tracking sites out there, how do you pick which one to use? 

For my situation, In case it matters for which stats to track/site to use, I'm currently ranked in the low 40s (Won 5 placements on KOTH, lost 4 on payload and one KOTH), I estimate my skill w/o the KOTH bug would be 45-50ish, which is where I'll most likely stick around for awhile.  I usually play an hour a day after work + some more time on weekends so I'm not trying to get hyper competitive, just better at the game, so it'd be cool if the discussion could talk about how all players could use stats to get better, not just those looking to be in the top 1-5% of players. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a difference between ironing out kinks and a failure of software development and testing. As a software developer myself, if they had an even halfway decent regression test script or automated tests in place this KOTH bug would never have existed. The fact that a game mode only gives you 20% of the amount it should WHEN THE WHOLE PATCH WAS ABOUT COMPETITIVE MODE speaks volumes to the incompetence of their QA team. On the software project I'm on right now (3 developers, 3 man QA team) we are moving into testing right now for a product for one of our clients. We're running a full regression test 2x weekly on top of our unit tests, plus spending any time not spent fixing bugs trying to break the product. Any halfway competent QA team could have caught this MMR bug for KOTH </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the ranking system is horseshit. Here's a summery of what I've experienced so far: 6-4, got rank 45. Total BS. Reason for my anger? 10 matches: five all solo queuers (5-0). My team all solo other team 2 premade of two two solo (0-2). My team one group of two rest solo enemy team two groups of two two solo (0-1). My team all solo enemy team four man and two man premade (0-1). My team all solo enemy team 4 man premade 2 solo (0-1). 

How the hell is it fair that 4/10 placement matches were vs premades with my team all solo and one mismatched premade size? 

To make things worse, 6/10 placement matches I played were KOTH, which apparently is bugged in MMR. So of the games I won/lost, all five I won were KOTH, one I lost was KOTH, the other four I lost were payload, which probably lowered my MMR even more. 

I've played three games since then, lost all three. All payload. First I had 4 golds, (all but heals, 3 announcered quadras), two I had one (obj time, tank). Last game I lost I had four gold medals (all but heals). In those three games I dropped from 45-41. 

Another thing that might be keeping my MMR low is that I like to switch characters a lot to counter pick. I know blizzard said your performance is factored into your rank, and if they're doing it based on the whole match per character it could be affecting my ranking, so if I want to rank up I guess I'll have to pick a char per match and stick with it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Does anyone know of some good bands that have black metal style guitar/bass/drums but vocals more in the death/melo death style?

I was looking at shreddits top 15 albums from 2001-2015, and I really liked the way the instruments sounded on the "Ominous Doctrines Of the Perpetual Mystical Macrocosm" album, but the second the vocals came in I had to stop listening, they sounded like total ass.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was shopping at JC penny's earlier today and found [these pants](http://www.jcpenney.com/dockers-modern-fit-slim-tapered-pants/prod.jump?ppId=pp5006930368 searchTerm=men+dockers+slim+fit catId=SearchResults _dyncharset=UTF-8#link_swatch) (specifically the Khaki ones).  

They fit really well, but as a recent college starting a new job it's hard to justify spending $58 on them, since there were no sales going on in the store.  So I've been looking all over amazon, the dockers website and the internet in general trying to figure exactly what type of pants these were, but I can't seem to find them anywhere else.  These pants weren't like typical chinos, they were made out of a very lightweight material (I think they had flyweight branding on them) which made them go great with button downs as well as v-necks, which is awesome because my office where I'll be working is extremely casual.  Does anyone have any experience with these pants and know where else they could be located?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a 256gb 8gb ram SP3, and my wifi has been so slow recently that my surface is basically unusuable. I'm talking 45-60 seconds to load a single web page like Facebook or Reddit, and if I try to watch twitch or Netflix the stream just doesn't load. I know the issue is with my surface pro 3, as my roommates are all able to use their laptops and have absolutely no issues while I experience the ones listed above, while we are both connected to our aprt's wifi. The issue exists even when I'm the only one connected which leads me to believe that the issue is solely with my SP3.  

I have the extended warranty for my surface, should I consider sending it back? Or is there an easy fix out there? I don't have a USB/Ethernet adapter so I have no way to try a hardware connection.  </TEXT>

Using your weapon is a necessity to keep the board clear in the early/midgame, however, I'm finding that my health dips way too low and its game over from there.  I've lost my last three games having 3-4 minions on the board myself while the opponent had zero and getting killed by spells.

Considering you need to drop 2 mana for a dagger, at least one for deadly poison and then 4 for flurry, you're paying 7 mana for a 3 dmg boardclear, as well as two cards. Compared to flamestrike this is trash. There is a chance you could combo with the second deadly poison for 8 mana 6 dmg, but then you can't use deadly in the early game to maintain board control.

<TEXT> I'm a pretty new chef and I've gotten a decent handle on cooking meat and vegetables. However, when it comes to pan sauces it's a complete disaster. Most things I cook, even if they turn out not great, are at least edible. The sauces, I've attempted on the other hand, I've thrown out immediately. The formula I'm using for pan sauces is saut one shallot in canola until brown, salt a bit while sauting, deglaze with a half cup of wine, reduce by half, add stock and reduce, finish with a pad of butter. The main problem I'm having with my sauce is that it tastes extremely bitter, as if the alcohol hasn't cooked up, and I've noticed since I'm cooling on an electric stove, I've never seen the flames shoot up when the alcohol is added like what happens on gas stoves in the videos I've watched on the topic. Is there something different I need to do on an electric stove to cook out the alcohol, or am I royally messing up something else? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anyone have a good suggestion as a replacement for flowers on Valentine's Day? My girlfriend and I are in college (dating for one year) and budgets are a bit tight, and it seems like most places want $20 minimum for a bundle of roses. I have no qualms spending $20, but I'd rather put it towards something more permanent that wouldn't die after a week. What would some other cool somewhat-sappy Valentine's Day gifts for a 22 year old girl in college be? I'm thinking I'll most likely just get a single rose for budgetary reasons, but I'd like some other stuff to accompany it. I already got her a really cool main present so I'm looking for more sappy or trinket-y type ideas  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Best Linux Distro for software development in VirtualBox? (Surface Pro 3) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-12 02:19:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey everyone,

I've been trying to do node js software development in Windows, but due to some current difficulties in a couple node modules I'm using I'd like to switch over to Linux.  I have a good amount of experience with Linux (Senior studying comp sci) but I've only used the setup provided in the labs at my school and know nothing about the different distros.  I've tried installing a couple different ones so far, here's my experience with them:

         Ubuntu: I like the OS but it was running very sluggish in the VM, even with a i5 256gb SP3.  I think it had to do with the unity desktop.  Also had a bunch of bloatware I wouldn't need.  

        Xbuntu:  The OS ran smooth as butter, but the xfce desktop environment didn't appear to have support for hi-resolution screens.  While changing the font sized help a bit, the taskbar at the top of the screen, and the taskbar at the top of windows like Google chrome were just too small and made navigation difficult

        Mint:  Installed pretty well, but it's still running slow, lots of bloatware as well.  No graphical lag like on unity though, just slow overall.  Also having issues with VMware where it has a notification that it cannot find the GPU and that it is doing all the rendering through the CPU.  

Overall I'm not sure what distro to run with, as the lightweight distros don't seem to support hi resolution displays well, but the ones that do have a lot of extra crap like libreoffice that I don't need.

The main places I browse right now are comphs, the main hs sub, and watching Trump's stream.  If it matters at all, the decks I'm currently playing are namely zoo lock and control priest. My highest rank last season was rank 8, so I'm at an intermediate level.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Senior in Math/CS here.  I would definitely take 347 before 444 or 447, as there are a decent number of proofs in those classes, depending on the professor.  I took 412 (Graph Theory) as well and there were a lot of proofs in that class.  347 also covers some elementary real analysis so I would definitely recommend it before 447. 

I personally didn't think 347 was that bad, it can be quite difficult if you are not familiar with the basic concepts of mathematical proofs though.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right now I've been alternating playtime between WOWS and Steel Ocean, and overall I like the mechanics and slower gameplay of WOWS better.  However, the one area I'm having trouble with is the leveling system.  In Steel Ocean, I usually get around 600 ship exp for a loss and around 1k for a win.  In WOWS though, I maybe get 400 for a win and 200-250ish for a loss, which means it takes 3-5x as many matches to unlock a new ship, and I'm finding that grind to be very dull, as many ships don't get interesting until above tier 5.  While I understand it make take awhile to unlock high tier ships, are there any tricks to expedite the leveling process from tiers 1-5?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm in the process of making a website using node, express and ejs.  I have put things such as my header into ejs partials for easy inclusion in all of my main ejs files.

However, if I try using a "2+ tier" route, ie "user/:username" or "forums/:subforum", the html loads on the page but no CSS styling is included.  I am using a common header partial on all my files that includes my css stylesheets, so I'm unsure as to why this is occurring.  I've tried Googling for solutions but I haven't been able to find anything. 

Gist with code: https://gist.github.com/Challanger2/62fd0c649bde9885ef84

EDIT: I looked at the website in firefox's inspector, and it shows the stylesheets in the noscript in the html part of the page, but if I go to stylesheet it says that there is no stylesheet on the page.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For a project I'm working on we need to parse svn XML data into php data structures so we can display it on a website.  All of my data structures correctly load into memory.  With the way svn_list.xml stores data, separates each file based on its path. What I'm trying to do is parse this data into a new class ProjectElement, which will contain the project name and all of the files for the project.  The issue is that my project class is not behaving anywhere near expected.  If I create a new ProjectElement and pass in a name to the constructor, if I call the getName method it returns null.  However, if I print out the variable I passed in as a argument to the object creation, it prints correctly.  Code will be provided below: 

ProjectElement Class: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0f097a1ba1a9c96ae612

<TITLE> Considering buying a SP3, looking for input/suggestions </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-08-14 00:59:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm a college student studying computer science and I'm getting a new machine for this year.  I have it narrowed down to a SP3 or a macbook pro.  My top choice right now is the surface, but I have concerns that might make me want to go with the macbook, so I wanted to ask you guys about these potential issues. Right now I'm considering the i5/256gb model with 8gb ram. 

Firstly, how well does it handle VMs? One of my classes next year has a fair amount of web development and looking at the class materials from last year it seems like it will be loads easier to do the stuff in linux.  I have external drives so storage isn't a concern, I'm more interested in how well the VM's themselves will run. Secondly, how well does it handle large IDE's such as visual studio, eclipse or Intellij IDEA? Another one of my classes is a project based class with a focus on learning to use all the features of IDE's using things like refactoring. I have no doubt it will be able to run simpler editors with ease, but I wasn't sure if all of the behind the scenes stuff in the IDE's would be too much for the surface.  Is it manageable to do stuff that can normally be done in the terminal in OSX? I'm concerned things that can be done with a package manager on OSX might be extremely difficult to perform on a surface.  Lastly, I do a bit of song recording/music production and will need to run pro tools 12.  Will the SP3 be powerful enough to handle it? And to music people that are using the ASIO4ALL driver (not necessarily limited to PT12), how has it worked on your surface? 

One last question, due to my budget the surface pro i5 comes in under what I have budgeted.  One option I've been considering as well is simply getting a surface 3 to do my mobile work and then building a desktop to handle all the heavy lifting.  All of the concerns listed about would still apply, but I'm not sure 4gb ram and 128gm ssd would be enough considering the programs I have to run, and also the fact that it has the gimped SSD on it would result in lesser performance. The reason I'm concerned about running an IDE on it is the class I talked about above that uses the advanced features of IDE's is a project based class, and you have to take your laptop to discussion sections and hook it up to the projector to go over stuff with your group, so it would need to be able to fully run those IDEs and compile large projects. I'd most likely use the desktop for programming the majority of stuff and the surface for casual use in this case, but then I'd also have to deal with switching files between machines for my project based classes. Another one of my classes is a senior project class, and I'm concerned that the surface 3 wouldn't be powerful enough.  I looked at both the SP3 and S3 at best buy a couple days ago and preferred the size of the S3 for tablet use, but I'm not sure it would have the performance for my needs.  Also if I went with the SP3, would it be able to play CSGO well enough to play competitive on it? Any input you guys have would be appreciated.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm basically (no pun intended) interested in learning some new musical ideas and techniques, as my band has agreed that we should all be practicing 45-60 minutes minimum a day, so I figured it would be a good idea to create a place for the community to discuss different things that they use to learn new skills. I'm mainly interested in stuff that would be useful for prog and metal, but feel free to share resources for any styles. 

To start things off, here's a few resources I love.

[TalkingBass-Link to Youtube Channel:](https://www.youtube.com/user/TalkingBassVideo/playlists) Website with in depth YouTube tutorials. There is content there to span all levels of bass playing over a huge range of topics, from setting strap height to different types of harmonics to chord construction. The thing that makes him great is that he doesn't assume you know anything, and outlines everything you need to do in a clear and concise manner.  I found this most helpful in his tapping videos, as I'd been trying to learn the technique for some time and couldn't quite get it, but after watching his videos on tapping I've made substantial progress. I highly recommend checking out his music theory for bassists playlist. 

[Alex Webster's Extreme Metal Bass Book:](http://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Metal-Bass-Book-CD/dp/1423497155) What I love about this book is it gives some great exercises to get into finger-style metal, with stuff for two fingers, galloping, and three fingers. 

[Daves Guitar and Bass Resources Page:](http://www.davegrossman.net/guitar-and-bass/index.html)  While mainly for five and six string basses, this is basically a scale/arpeggio/chord archive.  It contains a massive amount of information about a wide variety of scales (should be more than 99% of bassists will ever need) and things about basic triad through extended range chordal construction.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right now in my game as Whales I've taken over all of the counties not belonging to England, and I've been looking to expand into Ireland or Scotland.  However, my Chancellor (Skill 19) has been fabricating a claim on the same county for 20 years with no success.  I know crusader kings is vastly different than EU4, where a claim has a guaranteed time of one year.  I was wondering if there are any mods that make the fabricate claim time a set amount of time as in EU4, or possibly put a cap on it (say a claim has a 15% chance of occurring, if 5 years pass with no success then you automatically get the claim).  The game is extremely boring as of now since England has 2x my military strength, so its basically wait to see if a claim ever goes through or hope that one of my marriages with England finally pays off, which will take quite some time.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a new player to competitive, this game seems very poor at integrating new players into the game.  Firstly, it seems like no one cares if they leave at low levels. Within the last four games, my team has two leavers by round five for two of the games, and in the other two my team has had two leavers by round 12, while the other team has had none.  With the bots derping around and doing bot stuff, it's near impossible to win from this point on. Secondly, the teams are incredibly unbalanced.  For the last two games I've played, every single player on my team has been negative while every single player on the enemy team has been positive (Can provide screenshots for proof).  I don't know what attempts are made at balancing with regards to player skill and parties but it seems to be doing a poor job. To quote the wiki, "Don't worry about your skill. The only way to become good at something is to have practice at it and the same applies here."  But its extremely hard to become better when your team is plagued with leavers and people who don't use mics.  If anyone has tips on how to make the grind through low ranks not so soul crushing I'd appreciate the advice.  In terms of my skill level, my KDR is usually around .8-1.5 and I think I do a pretty solid job with callouts.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm looking for feedback on my general Eastern Block deck, which is primarily used for 10v10 matches: http://i.imgur.com/YNIVc5G.png

Logistics: Wheeled CV for availability with only 1 CV card, FOB to feed my Ondava's and resupply vehicles, and a card of helos and trucks is pretty self explanatory.

Infantry:  This is the area of the deck that I think needs the most work. I really like the LSTR-40's, I like using units like them or the SAS in my opener. The other unit I love is the polish shock saperzy, they are absolute beasts in city and forest fighting against other infantry. I'm having trouble deciding on the last three spots.  First point of contention is whether to bring to GROM or not.  For smaller matches (4v4, 3v3), I think the GROM would be very beneficial to have is it would allow for an inexpensive way to expand the AA net.  In 10v10's though, I find myself rarely calling them in because players are so closely grouped together and their heavy AA units take care of most problems.  My second problem is I'm not sure how I should be distributing my remaining shock/line infantry.  I picked the Mot Schutzen/Niebieskie because I thought they would be somewhat complementary, but I feel like this could be greatly improved.  Suggestions for this section would be greatly appreciated. 

Support: Ondava for heavy arty, PRAM for morters, very happy with them. STROP 2 for non-rader with solid damage/air detection, East German Tunguska for helos and Newa for planes.  I haven't had any real problems with this thus far.

Tanks: Moderna/Twardy for the top end, T72 MIM to deal with the midrange tanks, and T72M's for spam/fire support/fodder.

Recon: Helo self explanatory, Formoza for god-mode anti-infantry.  I really like using shock recon infantry and find they complement my playstyle well, so I take a card of the EG ones. I close it out with the Czech exceptional optics vehicle.  

Vehicles: I am in love with the PRAM, its a fantastic unit .  Its cannon is useful for killing/suppressing infantry, and its missiles are great at halting/slowing down approaching apcs/light tanks.  I took the Konkurs-M as I dont have a way of dealing with heavy armor and I thought the 23AP would be nice, but these could possibly be swapped out.

Helos: DHS Mi24-P has great IR plus the best ATGM missiles of the east block helos.  I only take one card of helos as I find I don't use them that often, and the EB doesn't have must take options like the Akula or Apache or Longbow. 

Planes: Mig 29 for air to air, Mig 25RBF for bombing runs,  Sierra 30 for anti armor and su22-mp for sead.  I thinks its a decent plane setup. 

Overall I really love playing the deck, but I feel the infantry selection needs to be improved to really make this a killer deck.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So if you dime the gain knob on it do you get a full out distortion? On mine if you crank the drive (not gain, could be a difference in amp structure) all it does is add some upper harmonics to the sound which gives it a wonderful solo clean tone, but it sort of gets lost in the mix.  Other then the non-existent drive I love my amp, but this is why I need to rely on pedals/effects/possible dual amp for the dirt sound.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The main reason I'm considering getting into a dual amp setup is that so far I've been unable to discover a distortion pedal or pedal combo that really gives me a great dirt tone while maintaining a big low end presence.  The issues I've run into is that I've liked the grit of guitar pedals better, but they eat up the low end like no other.  I've had a bit of success using the boss bass overdrive 3 in front of a sansamp, which sounds great though my map, the issue is that when we take the DI to record in sounds like shit in the recording.  I'm guessing its due to the cabinet I have shaping the sound slightly, as well as the fact the amp will have an inherent EQ curve even when set flat. The goal with a dual amp route (It could even be two bass amps with one having dirt pedals in front and the other clean, I'm not set on a guitar amp) is that it would allow a wider range of flexibility for dirt tones, as mixing and matching different overdrive, distortion and fuzz pedals would not affect the base bottom end tone at all.  I have a flanger and delay I could use for the clean channel right now, but the problem is I have no way to switch off two dirt boxes and kick both of those on live in a reasonable amount of time.  Another possible solution would be to use the boss LS-2 (dual effect loop pedal) and run one effect loop as dirt pedals and one loop as clean effects into an effects head while having a second head for the underlying bass tone.  The wet head would not have any dirt on it by default to allow for vibrent clean tones, but the advantage of this is its a one pedal press to swap between the two versus four as of now, which could grow even further with more pedals.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "The reason you're against octave down is exactly why you shouldn't try and substitute your bass with an 8-string guitar. Your preference for octave-ing up is a reason to stick to your bass guitar." 

This sums everything up perfectly.  The original reason I wanted the 8 string is it would give a wide array of variety, as I (thought) it would allow for low end stuff on the bottom strings, but w/o overdrive the mid/high strings could be used for chords/melodic accompaniment.  My main concern with the traditional bass is obtaining a wide array of tonal options, which I'm finding limited as of now.  Possible solutions would be a traditional 6 string bass w/ narrower string spacing, investigating a wider array of effects, or finding someway to vastly expand my pallet with my current instrument (no idea of how to do that).  It seems like the bass VI would be a good compromise, but I still feel the bottom string is too narrow.  If it was 31-31.5in scale length and had a low E with a .95-1 stringsize (possibly fanned fret) I'd jump on it right away, but right now I feel the bass VI will give up too much low end.  Again this is all my interpretation as I haven't had a chance to try any in person yet. 

I think I was thrown off before and I was focusing too much on the platform itself instead of saying "My problem is we need more midrange" and trying to craft a solution to meet that goal.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The reason I'd be ok with the octave up is that the wet signal would only be used for the dirt channel, so the synthy part won't matter as much as its pretty much gonna disappear once the gain structure hits it. The reason I'm against octave down is that I've talked to drummers before who's bands didnt have bassists so they used guitars w/ octave down pedals, and they said the first time they played with a real bass after that was a heavenly experience.  It might not be as big a deal for bass since the strings will be thinker, but I would be playing the same fundamental as the guitars were and I'm concerned the low end would be lost.  

The main reason that I would want the 8 string over a traditional bass is the string spacing. Right now I have pretty solid fast picking skills as well as decent finger speed, but the problem is that with the thicker bass strings combined with the fact that there are large gaps between the strings makes it difficult to play fast single note runs.  For example, I've learned Laid to Rest on guitar (I've played guitar for a couple years) and I can knock it out no problem, but on  bass my my left hand cannot keep up currently on the opening riff , especially on the last 12 notes of the riff (The bass part mirrors the guitar part).  I've noticed its more of a problem when playing with a pick as well, but trying to play something like Laid to Rest with fingerstyle just wouldn't yield the right tone.  I'm at like 95% of the original song speed with fingerstyle but only 65-70% with a pick.  While the part from Laid to Rest might not be the most difficult thing to get down in the end, our guitarist likes writing a lot of really fast lines to that of a similar style and I'm concerned I won't be able to keep up. Maybe its just a matter of technique, but I'm already working though Alex Websters metal bass book and working on technique regularly, and I don't see much progress on this topic area as compared to other ones.  I know John Myung uses a 5 string neck on his 6 string bass because he plays such complex runs, but as a college student I really don't have the cash to go out and have a custom instrument made.  The bass vi might be a solid remedy to this, but my two concerns with the vi are firstly that it only has single coil pickups (Thats an on paper flaw, I'd have to try out in person to see) and secondly that it's such short scale.  The benefit of course is that it has string spacing more towards what I'd like, but it also uses much smaller strings.  

EDIT: I should also mention that I already have a 50w hybrid guitar amp (2x12, solidstate pre/tube power) and a small selection of dirt/effect pedals, so going to a bi-amp setup would be as simple as buying something like the boss LS-2 pedal.  I could also use the parallel out on the sans amp I have to send a signal to the dirty amp, but I wouldn't have a way to mute the channel as of now. My main point of contention is I'm not sure what the best instrument for the approach would be.

<TEXT> Ok cool, thanks for the response.  In looking at 8 strings vs bass VI's, one thing I've noticed is that the scale length on most 8 strings is far from ideal, with most hovering around 27 inches.  Seeing as I would want the low string to be the same as the low bass string, and considering my band might switch to D standard, I'm concerned that an 8 string would not provide nearly enough tension, especially as my main ax right now has a 35 inch scale for a 4 string bass tuned to standard.  Bass VI's are usually 30ish which isn't great but its not horrible.  It'd be really cool if they had a fanned fret model out there with like a 30 inch scale for the e and it shifts to like 27 for the high strings, but that might be too much of a shift in length.  I really like the idea of having the higher strings available on an 8 string to go melodic when necessary but that short scale length might be a deal breaker.  I won't be able to try either the 8 string or bass VI out until I get home from school in a couple weeks.  </TEXT>

I know I'd be able to mix the levels on the device but I'm not familiar with how phase works on amp simulators. The main reason I'm considering the Bass VI or 8 string over a regular bass is that with the shortened scale length and narrower string spacing, it would make it easier to play more complex/extremely fast riffs.   I know that if you drop tune the 8 string the low E would be the same as the bass low E.  Would there be any discernible difference in studio recordings due to differences in string tension/diameter, or is that basically insignificant? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Prog Metal Bassist with a Problem </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I play bass in a 4 piece prog metal band, which is currently set up me on bass, one guitarist, a drummer, and a vocalist. An issue that we're running into right now is filling the whole sonic spectrum.  If I'm holding down the bassline and the guitarist is playing higher on the neck, we have a huge gap in the midrange.  Would it be a good idea or completely outrageous to get either a Squier Bass VI or a 8 string guitar? I was thinking of doing a two amp setup, where I'd split the signal and run one side to a regular style bass rig, most likely with a SVT type tone from a sansamp, and then run the second signal into a guitar amp for any dirt/distortion.  I'd use a graphic EQ to cut anything under 100-130hz on the dirt head (depends on how the rig reacts if I end up getting it) so that there would be a solid low end at all times, and then I could do everything from light distortion/fuzz to full blown djent tones on the dirty head.  We also do a few clean breakdowns in the middle of songs, so I could then cut the dirt entirely and move higher up on the neck to provide a more melodic backdrop when necessary.  I guess the closest band I can think of to what I'd want is something Animals as Leaders-esq, but with more of an emphasis on the low end for my part, as I'd be thinking and writing from a bass perspective instead of a guitar perspective.  Do you guys think this is a feasible idea or am I just crazy? 

EDIT: I didn't think to post this earlier for some reason, but here's my current gear.  Main ax is a Ibanez BTB400, and my secondary is an Ibanez SR305.  My bass amp is a Carvin BX500 2x10 combo, and for bass pedals I have a tuner, sansamp and boss bass overdrive.  For my guitar amp I have a Peavey classics 2x12 50w hybrid amp (SS pre/tube power), along with some overdrive pedals, flanger and delay.  I know the amp isn't the best for metal, but if it ends up sounding decent to good on this amp it will sound great on a dedicated high gain head.  Right now I'm mainly concerned with what could possibly be viable, as I'm currently at school.  When I get home I'm planning on spending a long time at guitar center and sitting down and testing these ideas out experimentally.  There's a very good chance I could go there and within 10 minutes realize there is no way in hell I could replace my bass with an 8 string, so this post is moreso the theroycrafting/input side, as well as getting feedback from people who have tried similar things. </TEXT>

* OS preference (Windows/Mac/Linux): Windows for the base OS, I'll be running linux on the VMs

* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): Wargame Red Dragon, similar strategy games, city skylines, BF4/Battlefront 3 (When Released).  60fps on high/ultra preferred, but I realize I may have to scale back to high/medium for some newer games based on my budget

* Other performance requirements (video editing, CAD, etc.): Audio production, VM usage

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility): None

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): I'd prefer a not too over the top gaming appearance, Something that might be too much would be those massive desktop replacement laptops for dedicated gaming.

**Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, two, or balanced)**

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight -vs- High performance: Low weight and high performance

* Build quality -vs- Low price -vs- High performance: Build Quality and High performence

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: Balanced

**Which features would you pay a premium for?**

* High resolution screen: 1980x1020 is fine, I don't need a 4k display

* A great keyboard: Yes

* A great touchpad/mouse buttons: Yes!!!!! I find most windows trackpads suck compared to apple ones, so a nice trackpad is a huge plus

* Great audio: If it has a good soundcard, then yes.  I don't need to pay extra just for some branded speakers as I'll be using monitor headphones

**List any features that are critical: **

So far three laptops have caught my eye, and I'm looking for help on deciding which one to get.  They are the Gigabyte P35w v2, Asus ROG gl551jw-ds74, and the MSI GS70-037, links below.  The reason I'm going with the GS70 over the GS60 is that for $10 more, you lose 250gb on the hard drive and gain 2 inches of display, plus you get a lot more ports on the sides which I like.

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=34-232-405

http://www.amazon.com/MSI-GS70-STEALTH-037-17-3-Inch-Laptop/dp/B00JKCHRXC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1428362745 sr=8-1 keywords=msi+gs70

Right now I'm leaning towards the Gibabyte, for a few reasons.  Number one is the fact that it has that removable dvd drive into a hard drive caddy.  When my old laptop died (motherboard failed), I had just bought a new hard for it a couple weeks beforehand.  I figured I can put this drive (500gb 5400rpm drive) in the drive caddy and use it as a dedicated virtual machine drive, while saving the 1TB drive in the machine for all my regular data, with the 128gb system drive being reserved for the OS and maybe a game.  It also has the best graphics card out of all the machines I've listed benchmark wise.  The Asus seems to be a middle ground the two other machines with graphics in between the other two, more RAM then the MSI, and it has better external build quality than the gigabyte.  The Asus also comes with a free gaming mouse, a slight benefit. The MSI wins out in terms of the best keyboard, best build quality and really slim design, but it also has the worst graphics by a longshot, less RAM and less storage.  The RAM and storage wouldn't be such a big deal if it wasn't such a pain in the ass to install msata drives or replace RAM on it, as you have to disassemble the whole machine and take out the motherboard to do so.  

I'm interested in any feedback you guys have, and perhaps you will see something I missed and will be able to provide some insight into which would be a better choice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right now I'm trying to install OS X Yosemite on my 2010 macbook, and I keep running into the following error when trying to launch the installer after downloading it from the apple store: 

"This copy of the Install OS X Yosemite application can't be verified. It may have been corrupted or tampered with during downloading."

Some googling on my part has revealed that most of the problems in this regard have to do with the date, however, I have my date and time set to automatically sync with apples servers in system preferences, and typing date in terminal gives the proper date and time.  I've tried downloading the installer three times now, and its failed every time, and I find it odd that if it was indeed file corruption on the installer it would happen three times in a row.  It seems all the advice around this issue is based around the date not being correct.  If anyone has any ideas of how to fix this I would appreciate your help.   </TEXT>

With the drummer wailing away at the toms and cymbals, everyone is gonna be focused on him so there's no reason to try to push yourself into the spotlight. By playing quarter notes you're providing a benchmark for the drummer to keep time with, which will benefit the band the most in that situation.

<TITLE> Best mid-range cost passive basses? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-30 05:51:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Right now I have an Ibanez SR305, and through my testing of other mid-cost basses (On my last trip to guitar center), it seems like basses in this range have extremely questionable preamps.  On my bass the only difference when switching between pickups is there's about a 10% volume boost when 100% on the bridge pickup, the bass knob just muddies up the low end when the low end is boosted, and the treble knob basically acts like a presence knob.  I was messing around at guitar center the other day and was shocked when I picked up a jazz bass, as switching between different pickup configurations and different tone knob settings actually made very notable and distinct changes to the sound.  I'm interested in spending $300 to $450 on a bass, used is ok, but the only passive basses my guitar center had were the squiers and fenders, so I just wanted to check with you guys and see if you had any suggestions on passive basses in that price range.  Right now this is probably my number one choice: http://www.guitarcenter.com/Squier-Vintage-Modified-Jazz-Bass-V-5-String-Electric-Bass-109437368-i3271155.gc

This is where I'm stuck, as I don't know how to rearrange this to obtain a contradiction.  Would it be legal to say "Take n to be 1/m.  Then 1/(1/m) = m, so we have m  m, which is a contradiction." I don't think this is right, but I don't see any other way to manipulate it.

</WRITING>
<WRITING>
<TITLE>   </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-12 00:03:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I would definitely recommend playing as a coalition or a single nation, the +5 or +10 activation points totally makes it worth it; with only 50 to play with you're going to have to take unnecessary compromises in some areas.  A good coalition to play would be euro-corps, good single nations would be US or USSR. I would also recommend looking up each nations strengths and weaknesses to see which ones fit more with your playstyle, for example the French have lightly armored but fast tanks, while UK tanks are slower but have much more armor.  Finding which nation/coaltion has the units that favor your playstyle is important, but its not something that will come instantly, its something to develop over time.  

Here's some general advice based on your current deck for ones you build in the future (I don't play 1v1's as much so I'm not going to comment on logistics/CV selection, as I namely play 4v4s so I CMV card is usually enough for me, but this might not be the case for 1v1s.)

Infantry: You normally want to have all five slots filled with infantry.  I usually like to take 1AGTM (Anti-Tank) card and 1AA(Infrared Infantry).  I usually grab the midtier ATGM and best AA, and don't upvet them, because numbers will be greater then the added accuracy bonus in this case.  I would also grab one card of line infantry in a cheaper transport and shock infantry in an IFV.  For the last card I usually take a commando unit (Spetz, SAS, etc, I personally try to avoid delta force, I find them disappointing) or maybe some flame infantry for forest/city fighting.  

Tanks: You have a pretty good selection.  I personally usually grab three/four cards over 100 pts, then grab one card around 70-80 for the last one.  I personally find the cheaper tanks rather bland, the only exception being the T72A for USSR for 55pts which is amazing.  Just make sure to grab whatever your nations superheavy is, as they can be gamechangers (LeCleric, Challenger 2, etc).  

Support: A pretty solid start.  I prefer bombardment arty (US Paladin, UK As-90) over the snipers, but its a matter of personal preference. Keep in mind if you select a coalition/single nation you'll get access to their prototype arty, which is usually extremely good.  I personally like to take 1 card of arty.  For AA your on the right track, only thing I would do is sub out one of the radar SAMS for an infrared launcher like the US Chaparral or French Croatle, just to have some good anti helo options.  Otherwise it looks really good.  You may want to consider dropping a SPAAG to pickup a mortar or a MLRS just to mess around with and see if you like them.  

Recon: Good for activation points you have.  If you rebuild with a coalition or a single nation, I would recommend picking up another recon card. Another card of infantry or a heavier vehicle to accompany pushes would be a good choice.  

Vehicle: Good for the deck you have.  If you end up picking the US or UK, consider getting the CEV type vehicle, they can utterly destroy infantry. If you end up building w/ a coalition/single nation, flamethrowers or fire support vehicles like the COMVAT are some other slid choices. 

Helos: Solid.  Maybe drop 1 card (not apache), but overall it seems good.  Maybe consider an AA chopper too.  

Planes: Solid.  You have air superiority, tank killer and bomber, which is good.  As NSWP said below, swap the thunderbolt out for the F18, its a much better value.  I personally like the F16 AFFs over the F15, simply because you get 2 instead of 1.  You're kinda fucked if you only have a single ASF and you lose it.  F15-D is a good bomber, solid choice.  If you decide to go coalition/single nation, make sure to pick up a sead plane.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your euro deck is almost the same as the one I use in 10v10s. Some thoughts: 

Downvet the panzergrenadiers in the non marder 2. I find having more of them is helpful in longer games. I personally bring a commando squad instead of the flame infantry, but those work just as well, mainly comes down to play style.  I'm also a big fan of manpads, so I sometimes bring minstrels instead of line infantry. I find that having two cards of panzergrenadiers is better then just one and then a card of line infantry and I really love my manpads, so jagers usually sit out for me, but again this is mainly a play style choice. 

Only other thing I would change is swap out the rafale for a ASF card that gives two planes. Numbers are extremely important for 10v10, and if you lose that single rafale it will really hurt

<TEXT> Do you think the stormers are worth it? I've only tried them a couple times, and was generally unimpressed.  Maybe my positioning was poor or something, but it seemed like the marksman were always the ones killing enemy helos.  Do you think its worth taking only higher end tanks?  The reason I took the chieftains is I wanted something similar to the 55pt T72's the USSR gets.  

I also noticed I was never using the rardens in the vehicle and I never called in more then 3 strikers, so I ended up dropping the rardens and one card of the strikers.  I'm back at school right now so I can't post an updated deck list, but I basically dropped those two as well as one of the cheaper helo cards.  The debate I'm having is whether to bring in the GR7s or to bring in a card of the 155pt challengers and a card of either the challenger marksman or the stormer, since you mentioned it would be worth having.  I'm considering the stormers because I've been seeing a lot of sead lately so I've been having to micro my radar AA, so it would be nice to have a non-radar AA with good anti-helo range.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's my general UK deck: http://i.imgur.com/0BMcCIJ.jpg

Deck code: DvAclo6xy51m6E8HKR9WVus8onp5Rp5OoY0ZsIXkZDpRCBDuReIwEXUKyHIzucKGDC7VPinxDkh4I5kZheJm4ViLJGqi6Rqg

It seems to be working pretty well so far.  I've only got a few problem areas in the deck for me.  The one thing I'm really still ironing out is the recon tab.  I'm just trying different combos of vehicles and infantry to figure out what works best.  I usually only take recon with very good or higher optics, so mainly its been debating between a second card of SBS or the spartans. The only other thing I'm really having trouble with is the 4th air slot.  It seems like the Jag GR.1A's have shit for accuracy and always miss, but the harrier GR1 has such a limited role with its paveways that I haven't really found much use for it.   Overall I'm pretty happy with the rest of the deck so far, and I'm interested to hear your thoughts on the deck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Came in here to reccomend Carvin as well.  I personally have their 500w 210 combo found here: http://www.carvinguitars.com/products/BR510 
I got mine used from Guitar Center and it was in like-new condition for $300. Between the parametric EQ and graphical EQ, you can basically get any tone you want. The fact that it has a DI level adjustment means its very usable if you need the DI. The only thing I dislike about it is that the 12ax7 preamp tube is a bit gimacky, I personally have mine bypassed as I found the amp sounded better with it not in the circuit, so it's not a major con against the amp.  I plan on getting a 410 extension cab in case I have gigs where the PA is crap.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> The question is to find a sequence such that the series of even numbered terms and the series of odd numbered elements of the sequence converge, but the series of the full sequence itself doesnt converge. 

In summation notation, Find such that Sum(An) from n = 1...2k and      Sum(An) from n = 1...2k+1 where k ranges from 1...infinity such that the above two series converge, but the series Sum(An) n=1...k does not converge.

I just don't think this is actually possible.  I don't see a way that you could take two convergent sequences, and when you add them suddenly they diverge.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right now I would rate myself an intermediate player, and I feel like I've hit a rut in my development.  I mainly play metal/prog metal, so a lot of my skill has developed around that. Right now I know all the pentatonic shapes (major/minor), all the modes, chord/arpeggio theory, etc, so I feel like I have a good theory background.  I also make sure to practice finger style and picking.  Right now I'm working on learning the modes of the pentatonic scale (see: http://www.frettedapprentice.com/modalpentatonics/). I can currently hit 99%+ on most of the metalish/hard rock songs on Rocksmith.  I honestly don't know what to practice.  I've been working on exercises from Alex Websters freestyle metal bass book, but I've been doing those for a while so I'm starting to lose interest.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Traditional music theory class.  I've covered all the stuff you mentioned like counterpoint, how chords are constructed, basic scales and diatonic stuff, etc.  We have barely touched chord progressions though, the only things I know in that regard is half and authentic cadences. I have no idea how to construct a chord progression other then it should have the I chord, V chord, and maybe a pre-dominant chord.  The problem is I have no idea how to pick pre-dominant chords and and I dont know any rules that govern pre-dominant selection.  For example I-vii(dim)-IV-V-I sounds weird to me, but I have no idea if that is just my personal opinion or if there is some rule of chord progressions I'm violating.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question about Peavey Classic VT 50 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-14 21:36:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Right now for my guitar amp I'm using my dad's old Peavey Classic VT 50, which is a hybrid amp with a solid state preamp and 2 tubes for the power section (I want to say 6L6s but I'm not sure).  Mines the version with on-board reverb and phaser.  My question is in regards to the preamp out and preamp in sections on the back of the amp, which is basically an effects loop.  If you look at the manual found here:

 http://assets.peavey.com/literature/manuals/80343001.pdf 

it basically says that the preamp out signal must be placed inline with the devices added.  I was wondering how accurate this is, and was wondering if it would be possible to run an external preamp into the preamp in section on the back of the amp while ignoring the on board preamp.  If I were, for example, to get  a Pod HD500, I would like to just run it into the preamp in section to bypass the on board preamp.  This would give me a lot of flexibility, as I play everything from classic rock to high gain metal.  Right now I tend to set the amp into a clean tone and do any shaping I want via pedals, as the preamp gain on the amp creates a pretty muddy sound that leaves a lot to be desired, but I don't have many pedals so right now my tonal range is kinda limited.  If it was my own amp I would just plug it in and test it, but seeing as its my dad's amp I don't wanna do anything to it that could mess it up.  Has anyone had success running something into the preamp in jack on one of these amps while not placing the preamp out signal in line?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is the proof that the rationals are countable the one where you draw a number table with the integers listed on both side where one represents the numerator and the other the denominator, and then you zigzag through the graph skipping repeated numbers? Our teacher never gave us a formal proof for the rational numbers being countable, just showed us the table and how the proof would work if done formally.  

I don't think the second thing is assuming what we need to prove, as we need to prove the union is countable.  We know each set is countable as a given, and so if you sum a bunch of countable elements you know that the result must be countable.  That still leaves having to deal with subtracting the intersection between the sets though, so it isn't assuming what we need to prove.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Fundamental Mathematics] Union of a sequence of sets </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a quick question about one of my homework problems, and want to see if I'm on the right track to solving it.  The question is: "Given that a sequence of sets 'a1, a2, ..., an' is a sequence of countable sets, prove the union of these sets is a countable set."  

The way I'm currently approaching it is to say that the cardinality of the union of the sets in the sequence is the same as the sum of the cardinality's of the individual sets minus the cardinality of the intersection of all the sets.  We know that each individual set is countable as it is given, so the sum of those individual sets must be countable, as we are summing positive natural numbers.  

The part I'm hung up on is proving that the intersection of these sets is countable.  And my other question is will this be sufficient by itself, or will I then have to prove that there is a bijection from the union of sets to the natural numbers?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [C] trimming \n from a c string </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-22 03:00:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For one of my assignments we need to build our own shell, and I get the users input with getline and store it into a char* originally set to NULL, so that the buffer is dynamically allocated by getline.  The issue is I need to trim the \n, but all the methods for doing so use a char[] and manipulating stuff with [strlen - 1] to swap positions, but you can't use array notation with a char*.  I've tried copying it into a char[] with strcpy, but then valgrind starts throwing up invalid reads everywhere.  It works on the surface, but I'll lose a lot of points on grading because of the memory errors.  Is there a way I can simply trim the \n from the original char* w/o creating new strings and dealing with copying shit everywhere?

<TITLE> Question about proving a summation form </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-16 19:29:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So for my HW for my math proofs class we start out with summation notation and need to get it into a reduced form, IE 1+2+3+4+...+n = n(n+1)/2.  The thing is my homework question states give the summation and then find and prove a formula in terms on n, and I'm not sure if I need to provide additional proof.  

The question I'm working on in summation notation is sum(4i-1) as i ranges from 1 to n.  I've gone step by step and reduced it to the formula n(2n+1) by taking it from summation notation into the n formula form.  First I took it from the sum to 4*sum(i) from i = 1 to n minus sum(1) as i = 1 to n, and from there took it to 2(n)(n+1) - n, and from there finally to n(2n+1).  My question is, is showing this process enough to prove it, or do I need to go in and prove it via induction for the n+1 case?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Disclaimer:  I'm just a metal enthusiast, not a gigging professional by any means.  

Your bass should be fine.  the only thing holding it back is it is a 34" scale length, which means the low B string will be a tad loose.  35" is ideal for a 5 string.  However, bass is a 5 string with a 34" scale length, so its not too big of an issue unless you're trying to get an extremely low action, as the shorter scale length means less tension, which means the string will vibrate more in the middle so you need to a have a higher action to compensate.  In terms of upgrades the bass is probably last on your list.  

Right now your number one priority should be amps/pedals.  I am by no means an expert on metal bass, but I have a tiny bit of experience so I can offer my input, although I feel more comfortable talking about pedals as compared to amps.  It seems like you're interested in what I would call more extreme metal, as compared to Metallica or Iron Maiden.  Some people might suggest the big muff pi, but in my opinion that won't be beefy enough, you will want a dedicated overdrive pedal.  A lot of the touring bassists will use something like an Axe FX and actually blend use guitar amp models to get their crunch for their tone (Paulo from Trivium, Nolly of Periphery for a couple examples), but that would be too costly for you. The sansamp DI box has a pretty decent drive channel based on what I've seen on youtube, so you might want to look into that, plus you get the DI to boot.  I'd look into the para drive model, as the adjustable mid range will be essential for using it in a metal band, as compared to the presence and blend controls on the regular.  Something like the Boss Bass Overdrive or MXR bass overdrive might suit your needs, watch some youtube videos or try em out and see what you like.  It seems like that bands you linked to weren't maxing the drive channels, just adding a bit of grit to the tone.  

I don't want to say to much about amps because I don't feel like I know enough in this category. What I will say is don't skimp on wattage, especially if you are not going to be using XLR/DI lines.  I personally have the carvin 510 combo amp found here: http://www.carvinguitars.com/products/BR510

The really nice thing about this amp is the fact that it is their BX500 head mounted to what is essentially a rack mount on top of the cab. So if you decided to switch to a rack unit, you can remove the head and affix it in your rack, as it already has the mounting unit.  Or if you decide to get a fullstack, you can remove the head and use it with the new cabs. The main things I like about the amp are the adjustable DI level so you can adjust it as needed to run to FOH, active/passive switch with a -10db pad for active basses, and the parametric midrange EQ gives a lot of midrange control.  If you decide to go with a combo I think that these choices from Carvin are awesome, but if you decide to go with a traditional halfstack maybe laying out what I liked will help you choose an amp.  I really don't know much about amps because I got this one as my first one, and don't see any reason to upgrade it unless I get to the point where I'm playing gigs where 500w isn't enough.  I snagged mine from 300 USD used as well, so you might be able to find a steal on the used section of guitarcenter or your local craigslist.  

Lastly a note about buying used:  it's fucking awesome.  Its a great way to try out a bunch of new stuff.  Guitar center is awesome because of their 30 day return policy.  So if you get something and don't like it, you can return it and its like it never happened.  Craigslist is great because sometimes you find awesome steals, but the downside is no return.  Unless your planing on going on tour, buying used is a great way to get some good gear at a cheap price.  Ex:  Boss bass overdrive $110 new vs $50-55 used.  MXR Bass compressor $190 new vs $100ish used.  

Hope this helped a bit.

<TEXT> Question about arpeggios, which I'm working on learning right now.  Back when I played guitar I was only taught the major arpeggio.  However, when they taught it to me it had a 7th in it as well, ie with your example it would include the B note below the octave.  I know that technically an arpeggio is the notes of a cord played individually, so would I have been taught the major 7th arpeggio instead of the major arpeggio then? Its throwing me off because I know a bunch of triads from guitar, but I'm not sure if those would be considered arpeggios if the notes were played separately.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you're more into modern metal, run a MXR fullbore metal into a clean channel. I found running it into an amp with high gain in a solid state preamp muddied the tone, while running it on clean kept it crisp. I didn't have an OD pedal at the time, so I can't tell you how that would affect the tone. I think it would sound better with preamp gain if it was a proper tube preamp  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everyone keeps saying progressively speed up, but I say progressively slow down. The main problem here is that your fingers don't have the muscle memory to make the change, so trying to go fast doesn't teach your fingers anything. By progressively slowing down slower and slower, you can really focus on what your hand needs to do to make the change and focus on building the muscle pattern. This strategy was taught to me by my drum teacher and it's really effective. You won't see results in a day, but one to two weeks in and you'll see some great improvement. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Calculus] Help with Stokes and Divergence </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-16 05:57:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm having some problems with assigned questions to answer for my calc class.  

1)  Verify Stokes Theorem by computing both integrals, the range of integration is z= sqrt(4-(x^2 ) - (y^2 )) above the xy plane and F = 2x-y, yz^2, zy^2).  Computing via Stokes was trivial, I have no idea how to approach the problem by doing the surface integral though.  I tried parameterizing in spherical coordinates, but converting the vector field to spherical got extremely nasty. 

2) Verify the divergence theorem by computing both integrals for the vector field F = x^3, y^3, z^2 over the cylindrical region x^2 + y^ 2 for o = z = 2.  Here when I computed by the div theorem, I got 279 pi, but when I did it the long way I got 243 pi.  Ive got back and checked my work multiple times, but cant figure out where I went wrong.  For the triple integral, I got my divergence to be (3r^2 + 2z) {in cylindrical} and my limits where {theta = 0...2pi, r = 0...3, z = 0...2}.  

For the long way I parametrized in terms of U and V, getting r(U,V) = 3cosU, 3sinU, V U=0...2pi, V = 0...2.  ru cross rv turned out being (3cosU, 3sinU, 0.  my final integral was 81(cos(U)^4 + sin(U)^4) with the U and V limits listed above.  If anyone has any clues as to where I went wrong I would appreciate the help   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I personally would get rid of the era restriction-I find it much better to have the higher quality units.

Logistics: Get rid of the 85 cost choppers and either bring in cheaper ones or more trucks.  If you one those choppers gets sniped it will hurt.  

Infantry: Drop the RBS 70 Stringers and pick up a card of SAS. Higher HE, bigger squad size, better training (elite vs regular).  Only downside is the lower range, but I think the other benefits are much better.  I personally would take the UK Gurkhas 90 over the Hudou-ren, but the Hudou might fit better with your play style.  Both are good choices, mainly personal preference here.  

Support: Drop one of the mortar cards. Not only is it slightly overkill, but you don't have any SAM radar AA.  For mortars I would suggest checking out the French Serval.   It has a low range but a ridiculous fire rate of 17 rpm. For Radar AA my go to is the 90 cost US one.  High range and accuracy make it a great pick, just place it towards the rear of your AA net to keep it out of harms way.  I would also recommend swapping out your artillery for the Swedish BKAN.  

Tanks: Looks fine.  

Recon: Looks pretty good.  I personally always run 5 cards of recon, I like having the depth and flexibility to run some more aggressive scouting, but its a matter of personal preference.  
Maybe consider a lower cost helo.

Vehicles:  Consider dropping the M163s and picking up an IFV with an auto cannon.  I've been messing around with M163's and haven't found a great use for them yet.  IFVs with auto cannons are fantastic infantry killers and are one of my go-to units.  I would recommend checking them out, you may find you love them or hate them.  If you take off the era restriction I recommend the ASLAV-25. 

Helicopters:  I would drop the bushrangers and pick up the US UC-1H heavy hog.  In addition to having a similar rocket launcher, it has the frag launcher which is a great way to deal with pesky infantry units.  If you can free up some spots I'd also recommend taking another card of AH-1s.

Planes:  Here is the real weak point of your deck in my opinion, for one key reason.  Sub-par air superiority fighters.  Look into taking something like the F15 Eagles or F16 Block C from the US, as they have longer range F F missiles vs the semi-active ones on your craft.  Your bomber/AT selection is up to you, but I found that running the F111C made it an instant target for my enemies and it always died very fast, because they would go out of their way to target it.  Consider maybe taking some napalm as well.

The lead part with distortion sounds great and the solos aren't too difficult, and the acoustic sounding rhythm has a great chord progression. A tad difficult for the first couple songs you'll learn, but definitely a good one to work towards. 

EDIT: LEARN HOW TO HOLD A PICK PROPERLY!!!!!!!! I took four years of lessons when I was younger and grew to hate guitar, because I was holding the pick between the tip of my pointer finger and thumb, and my teachers never corrected me. I got rocksmith a few months ago and learned I has been holding the pick wrong all along. After learning the correct method, I've been having a blast playing and now I can do strumming patterns without wanting to go cry in a corner.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see a lot of people recommending stick control, which is indeed a great book. I would caution against purely working from that book alone, however. If you spend all your time on the practice pad you could easily become bored and give up all together. If you get a book on limb independence and spend some time on the kit with it in addition to stick control, you will probably see more growth as have more fun. 

If you do pure SC, you'll probably end up with amazing chops but be stuck on quarter notes for the feet. If you do all limb independence you'll probably be able to bust out some insane linear groves, but the lack of technique with the hands will quickly put an upper limit on your progress. If you do both, you'll be well on your way to being an excellent drummer.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well for example I use my whey as a post workout supplement, but I really enjoy having some chocolate milk in the morning. Instead spending an extra $60 on more whey for two months, I spend $20 to get some BCAAs to take with my chocolate milk. There was an article I saw by Lyle McDonald (on mobile so I don't have link) where he examined protein timing, and came to the conclusion that having large amounts of leucine was the key factor in muscle growth. This basically allows me to get the most out of the protein in my chocolate milk. I used to take four scoops of whey a day (2 scoops for 2 shakes), but after taking the second shake I always got a massive headache. Cutting out the whey and using alternate forms of protein such as chicken with BCAAs has gotten rid of the headaches.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> How can I build up the core strength to do squats with proper form? I can leg press 500lbs for 8+ reps, but my core starts caving at 135 lbs on squat. I haven't been able to break 135 with proper form for the last two weeks. Running Lyle mcdonalds generic bulk, so I'm squatting 2x per week 3 sets of 5. Are there some good supplemental exercises I could add to help?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Trying to learn C++, having major difficulties </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-11-04 21:55:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As it currently stands it is imperative that I gain a decent mastery of c++ for the spring semester of 2014. I currently have an introduction to java course under my belt, which I really enjoyed and did rather well in. In order to transfer out of my community college to the university of my choice, I need to have a second level programming course under my belt, however, my school is only offering it in c++ next semester.  I tried taking the Java course this semester but it was canceled at the last minute due to not enough people signing up.  So as it stands, I have to teach myself c++.  Topics covered will be stuff such as data structures, recursion, hash tables, algorithms, and a bunch more.  

I've been reading through the book "Wiley's Teach Yourself C++ 7th edition."  I would say that I have a good grasp on the fundamental concepts; control structures, variables and data types, pointers, as well was the object oriented concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation.  The main thing that I'm having difficulty with is the class structure.  Compared to Java it just seems to foreign.  I've tried replicating projects I did in my java class in C++, but I keep getting errors everywhere, such as the compiler not liking my constructors, even though I've copied them directly out of the reference book, simply to make sure the form was correct. Even more frustrating is that my book doesn't explicitly state how to get classes to see each other.  In Java simply declaring the classes as public and having them in the same project would allow them to be used interchangeably.  Whenever I try to instantiate class in C++ in a different class, the compiler tells me that the class I'm trying to instantiate doesn't exist. So while I can make simple programs that only require the main method, and perhaps some peripheral methods, trying to make anything even remotely interesting is turning out to be a massive failure.  

If anyone has any good resources on learning the c++ class structure it would be awesome if you could share those with me.  My book does a great job at explaining the core functions, but is very lacking and ambiguous in the section on working with classes. Also if anyone has any problems or projects that they would suggest solving that would be a great help as well.  

Thanks in advance.   </TEXT>

It feels like some pressure just builds up in my knee, and if I squat down (just to stretch) it pops and the discomfort goes away. Is this an indicator of a greater problem or is it insignificant?

<TEXT> Best way to describe the feeling is to imagine you're walking down a road and by chance stumble into a shallow hole. In an attempt to get out, you try jumping out of the hole. Even though the hole is less then a foot deep, you can't jump out of it. Even more startling is the fact that as you land from your jump, you realize the ground in the hole has suck down, increasing in depth. You try to jump out several more times, but each time the result is the same; the floor continues to sink. At this point you are desperate to get out of the hole, so you try climbing up the side. Right as you near the top, you slip and lose your grip, and fall, crashing into the floor. The floor drops even lower into the ground as you impact it. As you look up, you can see that the light is starting to fade, as you are getting so deep into the ground. You decide to try climbing again, but this time you barely climb 5 feet before falling to the ground, sending the floor even deeper. At this point you are completely broken and have no idea what to do, so you sit down to try to think of a solution. As you look up, you see that the light has been reduced to the size of a pinhead, and as you continue looking at it, the speck of light goes out, plunging you into eternal darkness. At this point you just break down in tears, as you realize you will never get out of the hole and are destined to live in darkness. 

Now what I want you to do is reread the story, but at each point I want you to imagine the emotions you would be feeling at each stage of the story. 

For me, the path of emotions from uncertainty of what was going on to the loss of control to the descent into total darkness and hopelessness is the path my depression took. I wish I could tell you I found some way out, but I would be lying.    </TEXT>

Drop the dragon ATGM infantry, they are literally the worst in their class for it. Pick up some Milan's or jagocommandos. I personally would get some heavier tanks, I don't like medium class tanks. I tend to stick to heavies and MBTs and then take a few really cheap ones like the French harpoons. I would also drop the LAV mortars and grab some with a better range. LAVs only have 4200 range, while there is another American mortar with 6300 and a west German with 7000+. You're a bit light on AA for my liking, but to each his own. Overall pretty good.

If he had had those forests occupied with infantry he could have considerably slowed down the rush. Also he had almost no hinds until he was pretty much pushed out of the zone. He should have had hinds out to stop or slow down the IFVs and other vehicles that were coming into the zone. Also more recon.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm 20, and stuck at community college so I don't see it happening anytime soon. 

Personally for me, the thing irking me isn't the fact that I don't have a girlfriend, but the fact that I've never had one. In my main group of friends we all have pretty similar personalities and hobbies, and so when I see them all being successful and getting really cool girlfriends, it just messes with my head and self esteem. If we are so similar and they are doing so well with women, it just makes me feel like a failure. The other thing that bothers me is the fact that women never seem to be interested in me, and I'll explain what I mean by that. If me and my friends are hanging out with some girls and my friends tell a story, all the girls will be genuinely interested in what they are saying. If I either add in to their story or branch out on a relevant tangent, the girls will look at me with a look of feeling sorry for me and that they are only listening out of pity. I know that I'm not completely derailing the group because my friends would tell me if what I said made no sense whatsoever. 

I've done all the typical stuff that people day to do to "get a life". I've been working out for the past 6 months, got clothes that actually fit me, took up mixed martial arts, started playing the drums and cut down drastically on the time I spend playing video games. Objectively, I know that I'm in a much better place then I was a year ago. However, when I look in the mirror I still see the tiny 14 year old kid that no one would talk to, that turned to playing world of Warcraft 5+ hours a day because my guild mates were the only people that treated me like a human being, and I have no idea how to overcome this.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Although you're being sarcastic, your post perfectly illustrates the point I am trying to make. When people say "just be confident", they don't mean be confident in what you're good at. They instead mean "be confident in some skill that will elevate you in the eyes of women and has no negative impact on your social image". When you have hobbies like myself, such as programming, video games, and political analysis, it's not exactly easy to wrap them up under the context of being confident to attract women.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, but knowing you absolutely rock at something does not mean instant confidence and success with women. I personally love computer science, and I am very confident in my ability to write programs. I've made a couple side-scrolling games that were really fun to make and turned out pretty good. I haven't had any upper level schooling in concepts such as compiler theory or assembly language, but if someone presented me a problem that needed a program solution I am 100% sure I could make something to fit their specifications. 

Just because I know I rock at comp sci does not mean I've had instant success with women. In fact, it's completely the opposite. I'll turn 20 in a little over a week, and have not even kissed a girl. So I'm not really seeing what your throwing down here. I guess I just got the opposite side of the same coin.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Training for Endurance? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-04-28 21:13:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a specific fitness goal in mind, which is to be able to successfully make the competition team at my mixed martial arts school.  The hardest part about this process is the physical test that they put you through in order to get on the team.  It is a complete overload of your endurance.  People on the team now told me that when you walk in the instructors tell you that their goal is to break you physically. They usually have three to four people walking around with puke buckets. They are purely interested in endurance: they don't care if you can do five pullups with 45 lbs added, they want you to be able to do 20 pullups, rest 30 seconds and then do 20 more, and then 20 more after another 30 second break.   

So my question is how can I properly train for this?  Programs such as starting strength and SL will get me strong, but it probably won't have as much of a carryover as dedicated endurance training.  I looked in the program picker and the FAQ, but was unable to find any dedicated programs for endurance.  I know you want to be working in the 15-25 rep range for endurance and that cardio work will be important, but that's about it.  I was thinking of doing something along the lines of http://www.teenbodybuilding.com/brent2.htm (My current physical level would have me starting at the second nine weeks-week 1), but adding in lifts in the areas that they missed hitting (Some shoulder presses, rows, squats and deadlifts) all in that 15-25 rep range.  

Any advice you guys have would be greatly appreciated.  I'm planning to return to a more traditional plan (probably 5/3/1) after the tryouts.    </TEXT>

<TITLE> Effectiveness of slow bulk/recomp vs traditional bulk/cut? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-04-06 03:54:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was wondering if there have been any studies or investigations into the effectiveness of the two over a long period of time. I know that obviously you will put on more muscle mass over a given time period with a traditional bulk. However, it seems as though the time of the cut is forgotten.  I was wondering how that affected the efficiency?  For example, say we have a 9 month period over which the exercise is completed. We will define slow bulk as any surplus less then 400 calories, recomp within a range of +- 250 cals, and traditional bulk as a surplus that starts at +500 calories, which could be increased if progress stalled. How would the muscle mass gained on a traditional bulk of 5 months and cut of 4 months compare to a 9 month recomp compare to a 7 month slow bulk and a 2 month cut?

Tl;dr: if you have the same period of time in which one person gained a lot of muscle over half the time and gained no muscle from the other half, how would the muscle gained compare to someone ego gained muscle at a slower rate for 3/4 to 4/5 of the time and cut for the rest? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hijacking this post as a mma student to throw down a few tips. 

Try not to throw power punches and land them full force (cross, hooks and uppercuts). The danger of breaking your knuckles is too great. Go for hammer punches (side of your fist) or palm punches if you are throwing for power. You can throw the aforementioned punches to set up other moves (ie hook to their jaw to distract them, but not full power, and then go for a groin shot). 

If you decide to go for kicks, try to hit with your shin instead of your foot. Protects you and hurts them more.  I wouldn't recommend going for power kicks unless you know proper form. 

End the fight fast. Go for groin shots, eye gouging etc. there's a reason those moves aren't allowed in mma fights. 

Don't take the fight to the ground unless absolutely necessary. If you go to the ground in an alley for example, there's no telling if the guy has three buddies that are sneaking up behind you. 

Best technique is avoidance. One of my instructors had a guy cut him off on the freeway, break to a stop and get out of the car and start dropping f bombs at my instructor and yelling at him to come out and fight. Seeing as my instructor has been in multiple cage matches, he could have easily destroyed the guy. Instead, he just said have a nice day and drove off once there was a gap in traffic.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Question for women that I would answered. I'm very familiar with all the things that guys do in conversations that appear creepy. However, it seems that women label me a creep even if I've never spoken to them. For example, going out of their way to avoid me, staring at me and looking away when I notice, and overall body language of dismissiveness (ie crossed legs or arms, body turned away, etc). What behaviors could I be doing that evoke this response?    </TEXT>

<TEXT> You have to begin this argument by making a case that allowing women to serve in combat positions and drafting women are two different things.  This isn't really that hard to do, as they actually *are* two different things.  One lets those women who choose to do so to serve their country to the best of their abilities.  The other says we're just going to randomly pull mothers, sisters, wives and daughters out of the civilian population and stick them down in combat.  Regardless of whether you think these two things should go hand-in-hand they are actually two different things.

But pulling fathers, brothers, husbands and sons out of the civilian population and sticking them in combat is ok?

<TITLE> Issue with fit on jeans </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-01-10 00:06:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ok guys, I have a bit of a problem here.  I have a little smaller than average legs, but I have a huge ass.  This presents a huge problem when shopping for jeans.  I'd definitely prefer to go with a tapered fit, because that is what shapes the best to my lower legs. However, the issue then becomes the waist size, which is most prevalent on Levi styled jeans.  If I get a waist size that actually fits my waist, it is near impossible to get the jeans on.  If I select a larger size, my ass will fill up the extra material in the legs, however, because I have a smaller waist it leaves a huge gap between the the back of my waist and the top of the jeans.  Going up from a 34 (which is my real size) to a 36 allowed me to pretty much fit my fist in between my waist and the denim. This issue is on all Levi jeans I have tried, especially the 511's and the 514's, which were the ones I was looking for originally.  I tried on some other offbrand jeans, and the only ones that would fit me well in the waist/ass region were larger jeans in boot cut, but it left way to much denim flopping around on my lower legs.  Any ideas on jeans I could try?  So far the only pants in general I have found that fit me really well are the Lived-In slim series from Gap, but unfortunately they don't make denim version of those pants.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> I honestly don't feel that I'm at a stage to be approaching women, namely because of my depression and lack of doing anything that is found interesting by the rest of society.  Based on the experiences I've had trying just to have conversations with other people during my first semester of college, I still can't get over the fact that it seems like I'm bothering them by trying to talk to them. Second is I really have no idea where to go sarge. I've tried just talking with people in my community college campus but all I've gotten were snappy or uninterested responses. I've tried library, cafeteria and Starbucks but had no luck at any of them. I guess I could try a bookstore or another coffee shop, but I've just had generally bad experiences approaching so far.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't really like the rock climbing that much, so I'm probably not going back to that. I recently signed up for some free trial mma classes nearby so we'll see how that goes. 

I think part of the issue with quitting video games is the fact that they make such great time fillers. Lets assume that I get really into those mma classes. Even if I went to every weekday session from 7-9pm, did all my school work and went to class and continue my daily lifting/cardio, there would still quite a few hours of free time that I would have no idea what to do with.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The number one goal is definitely improvement.

I guess I find it hard because I really enjoy video games, and when I've tried out other stuff it hasn't given me the same satisfaction as gaming.  I went out and tried rock climbing at a local place, but I really couldn't get into it and it was pretty boring.  Tried DnD, which I thought would be a good fit considering my background, but I didn't like that either.  

Part of it could be the fact that I'm suffering from depression, which I just got diagnosed with last week.  They've got me on some supplements now + I'm starting psychotherapy next week, so hopefully I can start to get this worked out.

Mine are definitely programming and video games; my dream job would either be as a game programmer or an information assurance specialist.  However, here on seddit technological hobbies such as mine seem to be placed into a lower tier, and people say that I need to get "real hobbies", as though my choice of past-times don't actually count.  I'm really confused on how to move forward here and any advice you have would be appreciated.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Normally it doesn't bother me that I'm still a virgin.  Sometimes my guy friends give me shit about it, especially in high school, but I know they were joking. Now, I'm in community college and I've had some strange experiences with women over the matter.  On multiple occasions over the past semester, I had been having some pretty decent conversations with a woman and overtime the conversation would get a bit sexual.  When the fact came out that I was a virgin, their demenanor would completely change from being open and engaged in the conversation with me to turning away, avoiding eye contact with me, and becoming blatantly uninterested.  One girl who I was texting stopped responding the instant she found out I was a virgin.  This has never been a big issue for me until now.  Is the fact that I'm still a virgin really that big of a deal?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a quick question about my diet.  (Current stats after 7 weeks of greyskull, 19M, 190lbs, 6', 22ish% BF) I'm doing greyskull for my current beginner LP, and I was doing a minibulk along with it to maximize my gains.  I was doing no cardio at this time.  However, last week, I was diagnosed moderate to severe depression, and my doctor said he wanted me doing daily cardio, 30 minutes steady state on lift days and 20+ mins HIIT on offdays.  He also said he didn't want me eating above my TDEE.  Also, I plan to start MMA training 2-4 times per week within the next month.  I figured that since my activity level is going to be so high it would be a good time to lose some of that bodyfat.

My question is in regards to my diet and supplementation. I'm concerned that if I eat at maintenance levels, I wont see any significant fat loss.  However, if I eat on a deficit, I'm concerned I won't have enough energy, especially for the MMA training. Getting my necessary protein isn't going to be a problem, I'm more concerned about the rest of my diet. Do you guys think that I should eat at maintenance or on a deficit?  My current supplements are 5g creatine, 1tbs fish oil, multivitimins, and 5g BCAA before cardio, and 5g BCAA during.  Any suggestions to changing the supplements would also be appreciated.

<TEXT> Very good advice, thanks! Could you clarify a few things for me though?

1) Is it the basic alpha (I don't like using alpha but it applies well here) body language that I should be conveying? Or are there things I need to adapt for the concert environment?

2)
If I see someone I like, I make eye contact and smile then simply walk up to her lean in a bit and wait for her to lean the rest of the way I say simply "Hi I'm MrADHD" and give them a twirl then say "let's dace for a bit"

Do you literally take her hand and spin her around? 

3) 
 I escalate to touching tits, ass etc then a little kiss on the neck, then a number, to making out, then try (not need, just suggest or lead) bring her (and if need be her group) to my friends and dance there.

Any particular reason you ask for a number before the make out?

I've got another concert I'm going to later this week, so I'll definitely try out your advice.   </TEXT>

<DATE> 2012-12-24 14:50:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I went to my first ever EDM concert with one of my friends last night and had a great time. Just wanted to post a few observations I had as well as a question that popped up. 

1) Reading seddit material over the past few months as definitely helped me.  6 months ago if I had gone to a concert like this, I would have felt that everyone was judging me and I would have stood in a corner and done nothing.  Last night, I just felt the music and let myself dance.  It may have not been the prettiest thing, but who cares.  

2) Focusing on trying to find girls to dance with didn't yield as good of results as just letting myself go. Towards to beginning of the concert, I was in a "headhunter mode" of sorts, and was specifically looking for girls to dance with, and was starting to feel down. A little over halfway through the concert, a little voice popped up in my head and reminded me "give no fucks bro, outcome independence."  The second half of the concert then became much more enjoyable for me, since I was just focused on my fun and not placing requirements on my happiness.  


Now for the question.  I have no idea how to ask women to dance at concerts like this.  I was having to shout near the top of my lungs just to get my friend next to me to hear me.  We got to the concert a little after it started so we didn't have time to socialize and meet others before it began.  Here's a specific example: I was just out and enjoying the music (at this point I had had my revelation in point 2) and dancing around.  I turned around and there was this gorgeous HB9.  We made eye contact, I smiled and her and she returned it.  I may not have the most experience but I can tell that it was pretty sexual in nature, just based on the work I've been doing with eye contact over the past few months.  I turned away and was trying to figure out how to ask her to dance since I was clueless.  It's important to note that she was not right behind me;  there was a pretty sizable distance between us.  20 seconds later the concert ended and then she disappeared into the crowd, so I didn't have a chance to approach her after the show.  Assuming the concert wouldn't have ended right then, what would have been the best way to approach her? </TEXT>

 The clubs you wanted were shut down? (I don't even get this) Join a different club. Start a new club.

I was really looking forward to playing ultimate frisbee and inter-murals, but the school recently adopted a "No clubs with physical activity" policy, which means all these clubs got shut down.  So now the only clubs left are the career specific like paralegal club, ethic based or faith based clubs.

It wasn't one specific person I was talking to, but in general people at the university seemed much more receptive and social then at my CC.  At my CC it basically has the environment of go to classes and go home.  You get the feeling that no one really wants to be there, so that might be why people get so unreceptive if you try to even just have small talk.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know it's tough being at a CC while your friends are having fun and living in the dorms. But getting out of undergrad without debt will benefit you a great deal. It's not necessarily a fair trade for the social experience of being at a four year university, but it's the best you'll get at this point. 

"You might not be having fun now, but it will benefit you in the long run."  That's what a a lot of people have said, but it isn't always true.  I busted my ass in high school to get good grades and have a college ready application, and it was all for nothing now as I'm stuck at a community college with students who (Not lying here, heard three girls around age 18-19 complaining about this) cannot do the simple math of 1/4 + 1/9.  

Try to socialize more in class. I met a great friend at my CC. Get involved in group activities off-campus or on-campus. I practice a martial art and have some friends from that.

Everyone I've tried socializing with seems like they hate the fact that I'm just talking to them. I thought it was all me until I visited my friend and using the exact same topics of conversation was able to have great discussions with people.    </TEXT>

<TITLE> Chose community college and full of regret.  How can I fix this? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-10-31 00:30:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> TL;DR: Chose community college, it sucks. Time is spent browsing Reddit, watching TV or going to class.  Can't afford to transfer to big four year school unless I wait out my full two years or take out crippling loans.  How can I make my life not suck?

So when I was a senior in high school I came to the decision that I would go to community college for two years.  The driving factor for this was that if I went to CC, I could go to my dream university after two years which costs upwards of 35 grand a year, instead of going to a school with an ok program for all four years.  Right now, a couple of weeks after the halfway point of my first semester at CC, I am really unhappy with my choice.  

I was hoping to get really involved in college, and was banking on it in my decision making process.  Since I was going to be living at home, I figured it would be best to will my time with stuff at school.  However, considering my times weren't good enough for the swim team, I didn't make any roles in the theater productions at the school, and the clubs I was interested were shut down by the school and can't be re-opened, it left me with a lot of free time.  Swimming and theater were my big two things in high school, and so not having them frees up a lot of my time.  So I thought I'd just make some new friends. The best way I can describe this experience is trying to pull teeth out of a fully conscious man with a pair of pliers.  It's almost as if they don't want to talk to you at all.  For example, just trying to make pleasant conversation with someone in the line for coffee results in a one word answer or back turn. At this point I'm thinking maybe I'm just that uninteresting of a person and no one wants anything to do with me, and I've just gotten shafted socially. 

Then this weekend I went to visit one of my friends at his university.  What an amazing experience. For a concrete example, my friend wanted to introduce me to two of his friends, so we met them in some designated park for smokers on the campus.  In the half hour that we were there I talked to more people and had more friendly conversation than I had had thus far in my entire community college experience.  Going out to the parties was fun too. 

Thing is, now that I'm home, I'm even more regretful of my choice to go to community college, knowing well that if I had gone to a regular university I wouldn't be confined to browsing Reddit in my free time.  I've looked into transferring into regular universities for my sophomore year, but because of the way financial aid works at these big schools; I would actually be paying more for the schools I could have chosen as a freshman. I wish I could visit my high school friends more often, but the closest of them is 3 hours away with the majority of them being over 10 hours away.  

My question to you fine folks is how can I make my life liveable? There's nothing for me to do at school and it seems like no one wants to be my friend.  Waking up every day is like pulling knives out of my back, because I know that the only things I'll ever do once I get up is browse Reddit or go to class, whereas if I had gone to a regular school I could actually be out having a good time.  The regret of not choosing a four year school makes the pain all that much worse.   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was looking around, and was thinking on running a 7970 + 3570k.  However, when I put together the build with HDD, RAM, PS, Case, Cooling, Monitor and Optical Drive, it goes up to about $1300-$1400.  I know PD is due out in a couple weeks so I'm not sure if that affects the situation at all.  I would prefer to be able to overclock but I'll sacrifice that if necessary. What would you guys recommend cutting back on in order to reign in my budget? Also, I would prefer to do all my shopping at Microcenter if possible.

General specs I was looking at that were putting me over budget:

(2x4GB) RAM: 1600mhz if Intel, 1866mhz if AMD

Generic optical drive

CM Storm Scout Case

XFX 650W power supply

CM Hyper 212+

2TB Seagate HDD

3570k + Motherboard

Diamond 7970 ($380 at my local microcenter)

1920x1080 monitor ($200ish)

I already have a gaming mouse and keyboard.  

If you guys say wait for PD do you think it would be ok to buy the graphics card and use it on my current machine temporarily? My current system is a phenom 1 tricore with 8GB RAM, but the 5770 card died on it and I figured it was time for a full system upgrade. I'm planning on giving the old machine to my dad and having it run of integrated graphics.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question about hobbies for INTP's </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-09-15 21:16:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So for as long as I can remember, I've been doing typical INTP hobbies.  Reading, watching documentaries on the discovery and history channels, playing video games, etc.  However, this last summer, a lot of these started getting really boring for me, and I really wanted to get out and do stuff that involved being with other people.  At first I thought maybe I had become an extrovert, however, after some analysis I came to the conclusion that I was not. I knew this for sure because after being in social situations, I would always be exhausted and would go straight to some alone time to recharge. After reading all the stuff you guys posted on here, I really began to doubt that I was an INTP because of how much closer to the "textbook" INTP you guys were over me. Just yesterday, for the first time I stumbled across the cognitive functions for each type, and after reading about it I believe that I have a very developed Extroverted Feeling function (Fe).  

My question is to all of you guys out there with really strong (Fe) functions, what are some hobbies that I can get involved in that will click well with my personality?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a graduate of a catholic high school, I can definitively say that genesis was never meant to be a literal story. When translated into English, it comes across as being literal truth. However, when looked at in Hebrew, the language used makes it very clear that genesis is only a metaphor for the creation story.  For comparison, the language used in the book of kings presents things in a very factual manner. We had a king, he sucked. We get a new king, he sucked even more. The language used in genesis, however, presents a very metaphorical image that was meant to answer the question "WHY" are we here, not to answer the question "HOW" did we get here. Sorry for any typos I'm on my phone.  </TEXT>

Two:  If I can indeed get a handgun, what are you guys thoughts on the colt 1911 .22 lr?  I'm looking to get a 22 handgun just for plinking and I really liked the look of the colt, but I haven't been able to find much about the reliability and such of the gun. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One thing to work on would be what my drum teacher calls the "placement" of the notes.  I've been taking lessons since the beginning of the summer and this has been my teachers big focus for me, as he hasn't even started me on rudiments yet.  By "placement" what I mean is that if your playing 8ths on the hi-hat and you play a bass drum in-between two of the hi-hat hits, it falls exactly where the 16th note should be, and not too fast or too slow.

Some of you might think my teacher is bad for not teaching me rudiments sooner, but seeing as he has been a professional musician for over 15 years and that he has gigs every weekend I'm willing to take his word on this.  I have been practicing paradiddles (I think thats what they are called, RLRR LRLL) as well as 5 stroke rolls on my own to build up stick control.  </TEXT>

My community college also has an extreme lack of clubs and activities (I would say more then half of the ones on campus are language or religion related and no inter-mural sports).

<TEXT> I just bought a 2010 macbook from my friend as he had received a new 2012 macbook pro as a graduation present.  However, he cannot find the old CD for the 2010 macbook and we were wondering if I could use the disk from the 2012 to format the drive and then re-install the OS.  I think this might work since OS X doesn't require product keys but I wanted to check here as this is my first Mac and I don't want to mess anything up for me or him.  

A second question is he can't find the product key for the office copy that came with it and I'll need the key to reinstall office.  Are there any ways to get the key from inside office or in the OS? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I go in and order my first meal.  This was actually a legit meal as I hadn't eaten since 7 that morning and I went in there around 6.  The whole time I keep making subtle references to white grapes, but without actually mentioning white grapes.  For example, I would say stuff along the lines of "Wow, looks like you guys have a great variety of fruit here" and asking questions about how busy their day had been and stuff.  

After completion of my meal I went back up to the counter.  

Her: "How can I help you?"

Me: "I'd like a McDouble please"

Her: "Yep"

Me:  "This might seem like a strange request but I absolutely hate onions.  Would it be possible to get my sandwich without them?"

Her: "Sure thing"

Me:  "This is the weird part; would it be possible for me to get some diced up white grapes in place of the onions."

Her: (In an audibly angry tone) "WHAT did you say?"

Me:  "Sorry I must not have spoken clearly enough.  I'd like to have diced up white grapes in place on my onions."

Her:  "Get out."

Me:  "Geeze, whats the big deal? I asked for a simple change..."

Her: (Cutting me off) "Get out NOW"

Me:  "Fine, since you wont take my business here I'll head over to Burger King where they let me have it MY WAY"

I'm really happy with the sound of the two crashes, and the ride is good for what its worth, although if the pack came with a ride I would have no objection to upgrading.  The two main things I want from the kit would be a new set of hats and a larger crash, preferably 18+ inches. I've been browsing guitar center for their cymbal packs, but I don't know which brands/product lines (Zildjian K or A for example) would sound best for metal.

EDIT: Also someone near me is selling used axis AL2 longboards double pedal for $300.  Should I buy them or no?

<TEXT> I'm buying a 2010 macbook from my friend who got a 2012 macbook pro and I was wondering what SSD I should get for it.  I've heard bad things about sandforce based drives on macbooks so I was thinking of going with a 256gb crucial m4.  Is this a good choice? Or do you have any other recommendations.  I'd like to buy the drive from micro center as I have $100 in gift cards there.   </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Button up your shirts that have buttons, this includes flannels. How Clothes Should Fit might be a good read for you. Colors should be coordinated but not matching completely. Dark denim or khaki pants are always a safe bet.

Looking through the guide I saw nothing that would help with flannels. Any specific section I should look at?

And in regards to number two, you want a flat or slightly rounded bottom on the shirts for untucked right?

I always though chinos were more dressy, but its probably due to my lack of expertise in the fashion field.

<TITLE> Help with outfits for College </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-07-19 22:08:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm starting community college in about a month, and want to get my shit together fashion wise.  As of now my wardrobe mainly consists of jeans, cargo shorts, a pair of cargo pants, lots of athletic shorts and a pair of khakis for pants, and some polo's for work and a bunch of plain crew tees that are either college or high school shirts, or graphics tees.  I think part of the reason I had a rough start in high school is my look just wasn't there, and so I would like to change that for college. I've been reading through the sidebar links and a few questions come to mind.  All of the advice I'm asking for for the rest of this post is in regards to daily wear, not for parties or nicer occasions. 

Firstly, what shirts can I wear besides a V-neck for a casual look? Almost all the guides on the sidebar as well as user posts recommend solid color V's.  I have no problem with this, but to me it just seems like there is no variety there and things would get stagnate as it were over a long period of time. For my pants I namely wear jeans and cargo shorts in the fall and mostly jeans or khakis in the winter. 

Secondly, what would you say the dressiest I should go? I want to have a fashionable look but not look out of place. When I was looking through the basic wardrobe they listed a lot of polo's and dress shirts, but for whatever when I wear polo's or dress shirts I look really professional and not so much the more relaxed look I'm going for. Part of it might be my jeans fit, as they are too big right now as well as boot cut, but I'm planning on fixing that soon.  

Third question is in regards to pants.  I know jeans are good for sure.  However, upon reading the side links I had a few questions.  One, in the basic wardrobe they say no cargo shorts.  As this is my primary form of shorts atm I have to ask why? Jorts, yay or nay? I'm kind of a big shorts guy and upon seeing no cargo shorts, along with the fact that athletic shorts are out for obvious reasons, what does this leave me with in regards to shorts? Or am I going to mostly be operating on long pants from this point on.  This kind of goes back to question two, but are khakis too dressy for a regular day at community college?

Fourth question is how should a hoodie fit? I live in Illinois there will be some days that it will be pretty chilly out.  This wasn't in the comprehensive fitting guide hence my question. Or if you have any other suggestions for a top layer I would be interested to hear those. 

Lastly, how should a flannel fit and how should it be incorporated into the wardrobe. Buttoned up or open? And if open, how should the colors of the flannel weave in with the color of the base shirt; Complement or contrast? 

For reference, I'm about 6 feet tall, about 160 lbs, shoe size 10 1/2, pant size 32/32.  


Thanks guys.

<TEXT> I normally eat a huge bowl of cereal for breakfast (Raisin Bran or Basic 4 with soy milk), for lunch if I'm working that day a turkey sub sandwich with chips, if not pasta, some frozen meat that I'll cook (chicken wings etc) or some other wheat based meal, along with a side of pretzels, chips or some other snack food.  For dinner if we are eating at home its usually some sort of meat (Chicken breast, pork, ribs), side of salad, as well as some other side such as pasta or rice. 

Based on what you said I'm probably way under-consuming on protein.  
Also just for reference, I wasn't only doing those lifts but depending on the day we would have a bunch of dumbbell stuff life triceps extensions, curls, military press, dumbbell bench and incline bench, bent over rows and fly's. Not sure if I should just focus on the big power lifts or incorporate some of these; I'll check out those two programs you recommended in a bit, but I have to leave for my drum lesson in a few so I don't have time to look at those atm. 

Someone in school said that I may not have been gaining that much muscle because I have a high metabolism.  Is this fact or some made up BS?

EDIT: Thought I should add some stuff about me.  Male, weigh about 160lbs atm, 6ft tall, age 19.  Current Max on bench is 130, squat max is about 155 I think, deadlift is around 185, clean is only like 95.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Questions about working out  </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-07-05 17:31:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a quick question for you guys about reasonable progress and how much gain I should be seeing in my lifts. Over a 6 month period of lifting at school, I only gained about 10-15 pounds in my lifts for bench and incline bench, front/back squats, jerks, and power clean.  The only lift I saw somewhat decent progress in was deadlift, and I went up about 30 pounds in it.  The reason I'm disappointed about these gains is that my gains were very low in comparison to the other people I was working out with; most of them had gains more than double of mine.  I was on a caloric surplus everyday and had a 25g protein bar after most workouts.  

The workout pattern for the major lifts was as follows:

Monday: Squat and Deadlift

Tuesday: Bench

Thursday: Front Squat and Clean 

Friday: Incline Bench and Jerks

Can anyone explain to me what I may have been doing wrong or other things I can do to improve my progress? I've kind of given up on working out simply because I never see any gains and its disheartening to be spending about an hour per day working out and seeing barely any gains.  </TEXT>

you have to turn your volume up quite a bit to hear the ringing-you can hear it the best on the first and second closes of the hat. </TEXT>

In my opinion one should never have an abortion.  That being said, that is my personal belief and it is not in my rights to try to force said view onto others in regards to having it enacted as legislation.  From a legal standpoint I would see it as abortions should be legal where there is some complicating factor (Health of the mother, health of fetus, other family conditions, etc.) but not in the case of "Oh I'm simply not ready for a child".   </TEXT>

<TEXT> If I may provide an interjection here, I believe that the word marriage is truly just for Christianity.  I am all for gay "marriage", but my problem comes from calling it marriage.  While you bring up a valid point that it has been an evolving concept for ages, Christians coined the term "Marriage" around the 12-13th century to mean a relationship between a man and a woman.  Now over the years, as we have come into contact with more cultures and the English language has spread, there was a need to translate between languages, and because it was the most similar to other languages word for a relationship between two people marriage was chosen to be said word.  So overtime there has formed sort of a confusion around the word and whether it means a man and a woman or a same sex relationship has been clouded.  In my personal belief, "Marriage" should be completely out of government and replaced with "Civil Union" because there is no religious affiliation with it.  Gay people would be able to get married, however, if a church would preform the service for them.  

tl:dr: "Marriage" should be a contract between two partners and God (Gay or Straight) while all unions should be "civil unions" under the law.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had the HTC HD2, arguably one of the most customizable phones out there, and I just got sick of the hassle of modding after a bit.  For example with MGLDR, I couldn't charge the phone with the phone off, which over time resulted in decreased battery life.  Certain apps wouldn't work or even show up in the market because of the current ROM, resulting in the hassle of upgrading the ROM. Input lag was another huge problem.  Some games would be unplayable because there would be a one second delay between my gesture and when it was actually executed on screen. Unfortunately the connector that connects the touchscreen to the main board broke and the touch screen no longer functions on mine (I was hoping to get it to last until Jelly Bean was announced so I could decided whether to get the Galaxy 3 or iPhone 4s). Now keep in mind this phone was never meant to run android so that may be a source of some of the problems I was having, but so far my experience with android hasn't been great.

<TEXT> I find it very interesting that a school would teach creationism as a theory, because it isn't a true account of what happened.  The short version is that when the Bible was translated over the years from Hebrew eventually to English, the original use of the Hebrew language and the context from which it was used dissipated.  It was never meant to be an account of what happened, but merely an explanation.  I went to a Catholic high school and me and my religion teacher from sophomore year had a great discussion about this.  If you guys want me to go into detail on the actual context of the creation story in genesis(There are four creation stories in the bible) just let me know, but it is a pretty decent chunk of text so I wont post it unless you guys want it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Its fascinating that they estimate that the top 20% control just under 60% of the wealth, and would like to see them control about 33% of the wealth, but in fact the top 20% control over 80% of the wealth, and that's not looking like its going to change for the better anytime soon. 

What about all the hard work that people had to go through to get there? I am not arguing the the very rich shouldn't be taxed more, but more-so for the upper-middle class. These people are usually some of the hardest working people doing demanding jobs (Engineering, Information Technology, Business/Market analysts, etc).  The level and quality of their work is much higher then the people working at Micky D's or bagging groceries at your local supermarket.  Why should the profits of their hard work be siphoned off and given to those who haven't done much to deserve it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> While the robbery example I used may have been out of context, I still support the judges decision.  My reasoning for that is two-fold. One, via the 10th amendment it is the states right to regulate education in a way they deem fit.  While it may seem bogus to us living in other states, it is the state's (In this case Texas) to make its own call on the issue.  Second is because not punishing her for her truancy would have elevated her above the other students in regards to how they were regulated by the rules.  If another student had missed that much school they would have received the same punishment as well; it was not an exclusive punishment for her.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing is that in this case, as I currently understand it, is that excessive truancy is punishable by the courts.  While it may not make any sense to us not living in Texas, we need to respect the sovereignty of the states in regard to education ad let them make their own decisions.  Also I never mentioned armed robbery, simply robbery such as shoplifting.   I should have been more clear in my main post. The reason that I believe the punishment is justified is that all students are subject to these current rules, and breaking them when they actually need to be applied ruins the point of Bing them in the first place.

<TEXT> The problem is not with the parts I dont like.  I would like to smoke inside but I cant, because the government says so.  I think it boils down to personal choices vs how it affects others.  Personal choices should be free from govt regulation unless it affects others. So to use weed as an example, the govt should legalize weed, because it is a personal choice and only affects you as an individual, but the govt should be able to say you cant smoke weed inside because the second hand smoke will interfere with the personal choice of the other people inside who chose not to smoke.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) Lucky

2) A

3) D (My reason for D is that if they are legal they will help, but illegal they will hurt.  Illegals may drive prices down but their working conditions are very substandard and they are often treated inhumanely).

4) A

5) A (As long as they are paid minimum wage)

6) A (As long as they pass a simple background test showing no major criminal offense/affiliation with drug cartels/mafias/mobs).

7) No 

8) Depends on the conditions: If a general you are now here legally was implemented, no.  If they had to do some form of restitution proportional to the time they spent here illegally as well as pay back taxes, yes.  (When I say restitution I mean community service or something along those lines to help better the community's from which they detracted.)

9)B

10) C

11) C

12) It is a combo of the US gov, Mexican Gov and employers.  The US government does not do anything to punish illegals or the companies that hire them, the employers knowingly violate the law to make more profit, and the Mexican government has done nothing to try to make it's country a better place so that people dont leave.

13) No chance

14) Absolutely, provided they simply detain the illegals and take them to the police to be deported, and dont exercise excessive violence unless in retaliation to violence received from the illegals.  The federal government is doing a terrible job and policing immigration, and so states and citizens are trying to protect their communities from being overrun with criminals.

<TEXT> I think I should elaborate on my point a little.  I am a big believer in the worthy and unworthy poor idea.  I do not disagree with welfare in general, just with the idea of welfare for the lazy.  Here is an example of what I mean by worthy verses unworthy.  Let us say for example there was a family of four, and the mom was going to be a stay at home mom while the dad worked a 100,000k a year job, but the father suddenly passed away.  The mother has no college education, because the families plan was to have her stay at home, and she cant work because she has to take care of the kids.  I personally have no problem having some of my money put toward helping her out since she was not put into this situation through a fault of her own.  Contrast that, on the other hand, of say a man who is the kind of person you could starve if you hid his welfare check under his work boots.  Under no circumstance would I want my money to be going to help that person.  In a counterargument to your above point: 
"Second, if others are educated, healthy and fed that isn't just in their interests, it's in the interest of all society, and therefore yours. I realise many people think of welfare as handing free money to lazy people, but I think about it as investing in the future of society: those without jobs could get jobs in the future, and contribute wealth to society; if we just allow them to die, we have lost that wealth."

I think that argument is flawed when looking at lazy people, or as I like to call them, the unworthy poor.  The only reason those people aren't working is because they are lazy.  Take away that guaranteed income and then they have to go work to stay alive.  By giving the lazy free money, all they are doing is spending it on themselves so they don't have to work as much or at all, which in my opinion detracts from society.  
Also you mention how if we invest in them, they might get jobs in the future.  I would be more inclined to see welfare as helping them get jobs if they had to attend jobs training programs or attend local or community colleges at subsidized rates in order to receive welfare, and maybe be required to show that they are attempting to find a job and provide for themselves so that eventually they may move off welfare (Again we are dealing with the unworthy poor in this scenario). If they are being actively trained and seeking jobs, then that shows me that they want to become better people and I would not have any problem supporting that.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do agree, and I believe that the right to the social or legal contract of "Marriage" is a right for every person.  The problem comes from the fact that the word used to describe this word legally is also used to describe a relationship between one man and one woman in many religions. The US government is a secular body, which is why I don't think they should use Marriage in the first place. However, in its current state since that is the word for a legal contract I would support "Marriage" for gays, but I just think that the word "Marriage" is a bad choice of diction in this case.  My main opposition is not to Gays rights, just the word used to describe the rights. And to your above point, no, I do not believe that Christians created reproduction and the family.  Ill leave that belief to the extreme evangelicals.  And to another one of your points about marriage being a union of even non-religious straight couples, I believe that is what makes this such of a challenge.  It has become engrained in our society as a symbol of love, along side of being a religious ceremony, and moving forward with defining this is going to be one of the big issues of this generation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is a right to get married, straight or gay.  There are two problems with unions in our society.  One, people are not open to change and hence don't want gay people disrupting their old way of life.  The second is that because of the way they are defined, government and religion clash.   I think we need to separate those two aspects and then we will be golden. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The governments role would be exactly same as it is now, its just that the word "Marriage" would be taken out of all legal proceedings in the US and replaced with "Civil Union".  All couples, no matter what sexual preference, would receive the the full legal rights all straight married couples now receive.  The governments role would also be to make sure no people are discriminated on by the basis of their sexuality. 

Many people say that it would be such a hassle to do that, but in my view, if we could break the eons of discrimination of blacks in the south and give them full equal rights, we can change a few legal proceedings to say "Civil Union" instead of "Marriage". </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem comes from calling the contract "Marriage".  The christian faiths have been using that term to describe the relationship between a man and a women for centuries.  I believe that "Marriage" should be a religious term and that all unions(hetero or homo) should be civil unions in the eyes of the law.  Marriage, in my view, is a contract between God, yourself and your partner.  So gay people could get Married in a church that supports gay rights because only religious recognition of marriage would be required. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would like to start this off by saying that I personally think that gay couples deserve the full and equal benefit that heterosexual couples receive under the first amendment. That being said though, I personally think "marriage" has no place in the US legal system. Many people have claimed, and correctly stated that in the US marriage is a legal contract of union.  However, my view is that marriage should not be mentioned in the legal system at all for the reason of violating the first amendment.  The reason that I say this is that the christian faith has prior claim to the term.  They have been using the term for centuries, while the US has used it for less than 225 years.  Because the church has been using the term for so long and most states conform with the Christian way of thinking of marriage between a man and a woman, I think that the first amendment rights of Gay couples are violated, specifically the establishment clause.  By conforming to the christian ideology of marriage the church, in my opinion, is establishing a religion.  However, I don't support a gay union being called a marriage because the Church has prior claim to the usage of the word.  If a christian denomination were to spring up that supported gay marriage, in the religious sense, become a recognized religion, and then marry the couple I would recognize it as a religion.

tl;dr Marriage should be a church dealing and all "marriages" should be civil unions in the eye of the law </TEXT>
