So were they going to be roles at one point and scrapped, or why are they in the game's files? </TEXT>

$1,000,000 split between three children, so $500,000 for teo and $10,000 for the last. 

See my grandmother hated my mother and this was her last act of fuck you to her.

<TITLE> Got releasedfrom the hospital an hour ago. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-27 06:49:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So today started out as any other day, i woke up and vaccumed the house. 

I then went off to my friends house and played some games and fell asleep. 
Then after the mid afternoon nap I went for a walk with her to play pokemon go. 

I found a gym and was battling it, when I ran out of heals and went to a nearby poke stop to get more. 

Well i saw a group of people smoking weed and they offered for me to join them and i did because I thought it would help my depression a bit. 

After a few hits from a pipe and a bong rip or two I said goodbye and went back to my friend and left to go home for dinner. 

Well i guess I had taken too much weed and ended up going numb in my whole body and couldnt stop shaking. I tried walking and i just couldnt move. 

So i lay down on a couch and texted someone to take me to the hospital. 

As I was laying there with the thought of death on my mind, I was eerily calm. As if i had accepted that I was going to die. 

I went to the hospital and got in right away, thankfully after 3 hours i was sent home and told that i was fine. 

So thankfully i didnt overdose on anything and am haply to be here. 

Sorry if this doesnt fit the theme of the subreddit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One on the side of my hand from breaking into my own house. 

See i had locked myself out of my house in summertime and it was hot out. I realized that my cats were locked inside my bedroom and i had to get inside to them. 

So i took a hammer from my garage and smashed the basement window open, pulled out the glass with my hand and cut myself accidently. Ended up seeing the white globs in my flesh, and bled for 15 minutes. Got back to the side if the house and then crawled through the window and played with my cats. 


Another scar is on my foot from when i tried running through a field at school. See some asshole had placed pencils sticking straight up in the ground and I just happened to run over one. Got it lodged through my shoe and into my foot. It was not a fun tine walking after that happened. 

Thankfully I had surgery a few months back to get the pencil lead removed and can now walk with little to no pain now. 

I have a scar on my stomach where I was cut open as a child and had a feeding tube put in. Also they cuffed my stomach as I threw up a lot. So now i an unable to. 

And the last scars are on my forearm from self harm.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After owning the AIO by Joytech for about a week now, I deicded to give a quick review/rant about the device.

As for its size, and durability it's good, having dropped it on concrete and no more than a scratch on the paint. I'd say it's built tough.

Sadly that is about all the Good I can say about it. The coils last maybe a week, and after trying the second coil in the box, it burned right away even after I primed it. So, not sure if I would recommend this device to anyone after my usage.

I mean yes for $30 (cad) I got what I payed for, but for a coil to last a week, and the other one to last 10 minutes, that's just bad design.

In total I give it a 4/10 </TEXT>

The little punk came inot my garage before I realized what had happened, told him to go home as he was creepy.

Few hours later, (maybe one) the kids mother rang my house and told my parents what I had done. I got grounded for the night I think.

Still dislike the kid.

See my ex dumped me in summer, and my friend got killed 3 summers ago, so its a hard time.

I have been self harm free for oh, 4 weeks now, only stopped because I was sick of it not helping me.

Havent attempted my own life for 2 weeks now i think. so thats good?

I just feel so alone in this house and this world, have talked to people on here who offer support, but then they do nothing after a few days and leave me.

I have been holed up in my room for the past 2 weeks due to surgery on my foot, and get my stitches out tomorrow, am nervous and dont know what to do.  </TEXT>

Not knowing some asshole had stuck pencils in it, I got one through my shoe and had pencil lead in my foot for the following 12 years. 

After 12 years of pain, I got the surgery last Teusday to get it removed from my foot. It hurts to walk still, but thats hopefully because of the stitches.

<TEXT> I jailbroke my iphone 5s using the safari method everything ran fine. 

Then my apps started logging themselves out so i had to relogin every few hours. 

And most recently after my battery died and i turned it back on i got this screen [Apple Activation](http://i.imgur.com/ged9HS0.jpg)

I was able to rid that by plugging my phone into my computer and opening itunes, then it passed that screen on my phone and everything was good again.  </TEXT>

Here\s what went down, I sucked off my cousin. I was 12 at the time, he was well..young. 

I got caught when he asked em to do it again in front of my sister, who then told everyone. I then sucked him off again, and got caught by his mum. 

I hate family gatherings now, and am sure everyone talks about me since this incident.  </TEXT>

It started out fine, we hung out at the mall, then went out for a walk through town. I ended up meeting her parents and her dog (who bit me.) Went shopping and got chips and some pop, then went to a local park and had a picnic, everything was perfect and we started making out. 

Then time was getting late, and I had to leave, so I got a ride back to my place. Little did I know it would be the last date I was on with her. She dumped me a few days later.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sure many have been told "don't do it" or "it gets better". Well that's not exactly what a suicidal person wants to hear, in their mind they are already gone.

Instead take them out for coffee, and listen to them. Find out why they are suicidal, did a parent or friend die, did they fail a test? What's making them want to end it?

If you feel like they aren't listening to you, or wanting to be alone, dont let them be as thats when they will most likely try.

**Note** I am not a doctor, I am just giving advice on what has helped me personally. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lets see, monday went fine, tuesday the same. A bit boring without the kid i babysit, but eh. 

Wendesday my depression hit me hard and i tried overdosing on my medication. 

Thirsday I returned to self harming. 

Friday I shut myself in my room with my suicidal thoughts. Was not the best of days. 

Saturday I ended up self harming, a lot and now my arm is fucked. I do have a reason for it though, let me explain. 

See i wa in an on again off again relationship with a girl name shelby, then a year ago he came out as trans, and changed his name to Alex, no big deal im bi. 

So we dated up until last night when i royaly fucked up and made a comment on his status causing him to block me and in my mind dump me. So that has been a huge drain on my life. 

Tried phoning him bit got no response, even made a new facebook to talk to him and he has yet to add me or messge me. 

Its not like i can visit him he lives 8 hours away in America. 

Should have seen this coming though, relationships are not my strong suit. 

Really hope i dont self harm anymore, stuck wearing a baggy shirt to hide it and just feel ugly and like a mistake.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My family we grew up poor. 

We would visit food banks, and shop at value village (which we called vv boutique) I remember going over to my nannys house and seeing a n64 and being so happy. It was the first game system I played. 

Trips to the library were often as you could take out as many books as you wanted at a time, so we filled up a wagon. 

We walked everywhere and it helped instill in me that walking is a great way of getting around. 

Though we were poor, we would often go out for meals to eat at olive garden or mcdonalds. My parents, bless them, they never wanted us to know they were struggling.  </TEXT>

Was riding my bicycle home from youth and got hit by a car, got in the car with then to get a ride to the hospital. 

Funny part is I ran into him at the supernatket a few months ago, and he i troduces himself as "hey im the one that hit you with my car."

Another time i was lost trying to find my friends house, so i got a ride with a random guy bamed Chris in a orange jeep. Met him in a back alley. I made it to my friends place, and to this day havent found Chris again. My friends think i made him up. 

And finaly a few days ago i got a ride home after buying a computer from someone i net online. Thankfully i didnt get robbed or kidnapped as i had cash on me and could have easily been taken. 

I am sometimes too trusting with people i first meet it seems.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very interesting story, like many others I am skeptical though. 

Why would he erase everything not knowing if you had a backup? You could have lost photos, contacts, tweaks and more. 

And did he hinself push erase all times or did you push it? If he did then thats on him, but if you happened to push it even once, then you knew what would happen. 

Either way sorry you lost your jailbreak.  </TEXT>

I am using a tobacco flavor with 6mg nicotine, so maybe I overdid it?

Would it be worth it to try the other flavors I got that are 6, or go back and swap them for a lower nic content?

**edit** I am a dumbass, I meant 6mg not 60%. Sorry, been a long day </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This was way back when I was younger, probably around 10-12 at the time. 

I was attending a camp for the blind (oddly enough I had the most vision out of 90% of people there..go figure)

One night me and my cabin mates had been left alone as our cabin leaders had to go to a meeting. The one leader Dave (I'm pretty sure thats his name) told us not to leave and left a cup with water in it by the door so it spilled if open. Well my one mate had to use the facilities, so naturaly he waited until they were back. 

Then when he could no longer wait he left and knocked over the water. Dave was not happy about this. He got mad at all of us. Very unhappy guy. 

So the next day me and my mate are out walking around when we get called into our cabi for a meeting. I can't remember what happened but I rememer a cup smashing on the ground, nearly missing us. 

Needless to say he was fired the next uear and never returned. It was great.  </TEXT>

I tried getting diagnosed a few months back, last summer or maybe a year ago..can't remember, yet my doctor saw that I smiled as I told him I may have depression, and he brushed me off because "depressed people don't smile." So I am just really nervous and anxious about going to him again, what if he doesn't diagnose me, or what if I can't explain correctly?

Help me..

I will update in the comments after my appointment how it went. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I am in an open relationship with a guy from America. We have dated on and off for a few years and I've always ended up leaving him because of being ignored and feeling second place to his boyfriend he lives with. So here's whats going on, we talk on facebook and sometimes on skype. But the problem is he often goes a day or half a day without talking to me, and he always has a reason (excuse) why.

So with him ignoring me I'm not sure if I can carry on. I mean I don't care that he is dating someone else, just wih he could talk to me. I feel like I am second place to his other boyfriend. 

What do I do about this? Could use some advice on how to go about this, if I should continue it, or just end it right here. 

 TL;DR: Ignored and feeling second place to my boyfriend </TEXT>

<TEXT> I finaly managed to move down to 0mg e-juice. I started at 18mg, then moved down to 12mg a few months ago, then on a whim got a 6mg and liked it. Got a 3mg few weeks ago and yesterday got 2 0mg juices.

Let me just say, tasting flavours is awesome, and no more headaches for me. So excited to go try more flavors now :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey everyone, so I am using a vision spinner, thus I am needing one with the 510 connection so it screws on to the pen, not the ego threading. So I am wondering what everyone recommends? I am going out today in hopes of buying a tank, and could use some recommendations. 

I am currently using the aspire k1 bvc. But with it being glass, I figure I need a backup tank. 

Thanks and happy vaping!

<TEXT> Just wondering why everyone here started vaping. 

Now I wasn't a hard smoker like most people who start vaping, I'd go through 3 smokes daily for about a week, then quit for a month, then startup again. So with that in mind, I was selling a windows 8 tablet on a local classified site, and ended up finding someone who was swilling to trade it for a vape kit, so I figured why not? 

After getting home and trying to put juice in the closed tank (yes, I was very much new to this) I looked online, and figured out I had to open it up and pour the liquid inside the tank. So after that the rest is history. 

Looking to move down from my 18mg and 12mg juices to 3mg and 6mg, thankfully mixing a few together has helped cut it back quite a bit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I've decided that after all these years of me being depressed, I need some help.
I have been depressed for a few years now, 5 I think, its affecting my memory and my energy, i just stay in bed and don't leave for a day sometimes. I was happy dating my boyfriend, but being in a LDR has made it harder for me, and both him. And with him going in to a hospital for his mental health and other personal issues I just feel like I am going to lose him.

I have made it 2 months and 4 weeks self harm free as of today. I will be 3 months on Monday, yet I just can't shake the thought that I should just throw it all away. I find when I do it, I am able to think for a few minutes and have a clear head, so maybe it's the right thing to do?
I just don't know anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just would like to give a shoutout to them as they are always so helpful with helping me figure out things.

Take yesterday as an example, I went in and asked about mixing liquids and they explained it, and gave me a new coil for free and filled up my tank. 
Last week they gave me an exchange on my old coils (were opened, and only had 3 of them) 

Their shop is clean and the staff are friendly, and it doesn't get busy there, at most a minute wait for someone to help me. Also nice that they have a juice bar for testing. I Would recommend it to anyone in the Winnipeg or Brandon area just to pop in and check it out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure if this is the right place, but it's a start. I have depression, and with my sister and her kids living here, it's gotten worse. She moved in 2 months ago, and was only supposed to live here for a week, then go back to live in her apartment out of the city, but she delightfully told us that she is staying. And the following saturday went out and packed up her stuff with my dad and moved in. She hasn't left since and it is just terrible, for all of us. 

She constantly yells and threatens her one kid, while leving us to watch him, then she just goes out with her other kid and does whatever she wants. 

Her being here hasn't helped my depression, and she has made all of us cry and she's not happy until everyone around her is miserable. 

Take tonight as an example, I was helping her with a dresser from Ikea, then she yelled at her one kid and took away his tablet so he was crying so I didn't want to be in the same room as her screaming and threatening him. I walked away, to which she followed me to my room and threatened me saying "mom and dad will yell at you when they come home" (they wont) 

She went as far as calling my mother at work and picking a fight with her, in the end she hung up angrily and came to my room and told me this "You better help me build this dresser or I am going to tell mom that your oils and pipes, then im going to smash them." She was talking about my vape, and juices, and I really hope she doesn't touch them, as I do not have the money right now to afford to replace them. 

So I am writing this in hopes someone can help me with what to do, her being here is making me depressed and scared..help me please Reddit..

<TEXT> Just post below why you got into vping, im curious as to why everyone is here. 

A bit of a back story, I use to smoke 3 cigarettes on my way to church and at youth i would leave to go smoke one or two every time i was there. And after getting violently ill from nicotine, i quit, and just by chance got introduced to vaping by a local guy who made his own e juice and he gave me a kit whim after doing an online deal through local BST site. I ended up trading a tablet for a vape kit, and it worked well, got me off cigarettes that night and havent looked back. Was the simple pen styl, i think a 320mah vape with variable voltage, which i ended up breaking on accident and have since been stuck with the vision spinners and vapros stylish pen vapes. Looking forward to upgrading to a evic mini sometime in february hopefully **fingers crossed** </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey all, i'm back here with the same issues as before. My one tank is an aspire k1 and it keeps gurgling, spitting juice at me and is just terrible to use. 

I have it on a vision vapros stylish pen style vape. The coil is 1.6ohm running at 3.8v (the device doesn't have vw)

I have even gone as for as running the coil outside of the tank and waiting for it to dry out, then putting it back in the tank, but alas that didn't solve my issues. 

Anything you guys suggest I will try, thanks CECR. </TEXT>

So, it goes from 3.3v up to 4.8v, should I run it at full volts or is that usually a bad idea? (its not temp control)

How long do they last in terms of battery life before they are dead completely? Months or no?

Is it bad for the device to charge it when it isnt dead, e.g. at 40%?

Are there any things I should know in terms of using it safely, so I don't break it or anything. </TEXT>

Darkness covers the room. In the corner a flickering candle stands. 

The clock slowly ticking away, as his heartbeat slows.

In the distance a siren, probably another break in.

A bottle hits the floor and breaks, time stops. 

Eyes closed, skin pale

The news says he was so young, how could he.

Friends are mourning,

The streetlights go out, and out slips a whisper

Behind closed doors.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I want to get into pc gaming, so I thought here would give me some advice.
I would like to run games such as gta 4/5, half life 2, borderlands, project cars, ect.. They can run on medium-high at 720, I dont need anything fancy. 
If possible I would prefer an amd cpu over intel

Budget: $400, but I could go as high as $550.

Operating system: I already have one

Peripherals: Not needed, i already have a monitor, keyboard and mouse

Thanks </TEXT>

Current setup is a vapros stylish pen, and for the tank i am switching between a kangertech evod2 and a clear 16d wvm (probably botched the name) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So today marks 4 months and a day that I have stopped self harming! I am so proud of myself for coming so far, and will continue to keep going and see how far I can get. 

I have had a few times that I have wanted to continue again, but decided it wasn't worth it, as for me it didn't do anything to help me. Just made me more depressed, but now that I have stopped I feel happy again and just free from that awful cycle of depression and self harm that I got so wrapped up in. 

Hopefully I can keep going and eventually make it 6 months self harm free. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I watched a movie a year ago and it was about a high schooler who went to jail for a day, then he came back and reinvented himself as a cool guy, and was the top of the food chain. I think he was played by vanilla ice, though not sure. He would do a stare and everyone backed away from him, thats all i really remember from the movie.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> The light at the end of the tunnel... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-21 01:58:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just feel like I am walking my life in a tunnel, and sure everyone says "Oh, there's always a light at the end of the tunnel." Of course, there is. It just keeps moving further and further away.

See, I went on a youth retreat this past weekend, I thought it would be good for me, and that I could focus on the joys of the weekend and spend some time with my fellow youth and just have a good time. Well, I was wrong. Around 11 a.m of the second day of being there, my depression came back, and I just felt so horrible. I decided to eat lunch and felt a bit better. 

Then later on in the evening we had youth group time, and I just went numb. Just emotionally numb, it started when K told the youth she had a new bf and was having trust issues. I guess that just set me off. She and I dated on and off for two years, maybe three...can't remember now. I just know last time I was at the youth retreat me and her got back together, so that was on my mind the whole week, and I couldn't handle it. 

 From that day up until Monday evening when I got home I just felt horribly numb and just couldn't bring myself out of it. 

On the 8-hour bus ride home, I fell asleep, but was woken by my thoughts, and found myself just depressed, so I spent the last 2 hours in silence staring out the window wishing I were dead. 

And about an hour ago I tried to kill myself, but decided it wasn't worth it, but now I'm scared I may try again.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey everyone, so I am debating about buying the hp stream 7. Its a $120 tablet here in Caanda.
I would like it for its price, portability, and also I will be using it for playing older games (san andreas, half life 2, and if possible LoL)
What games, if any can it play besides older ones? 
I havent used windows in probably just over a year now, as I have been a linux user, how hard is windows 8 to get into? 
Is the hp stream 7 a good buy for the price?

Edit: Bought the hp stream 7, it's a good tablet for its price.

Edit 2: Sold it, the stream 7 is a piece of junk.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [TOMT] [Android Game] Point and click adventure where you are alone in a town </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-06 01:16:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It was an android game that came out in 2012 I think. You started out in a town and had to figure out different puzzles to advance to the next place. I believe it was 2D and a top down type game.  In the end you ended up in a church and talked to the priest who told you everyone was raptured. I believe you could go into houses and if you found items you could explore them a bit and find out about the people that lived there. Kind of like flashback sequences. 
I remember the first level had to do with trying to make it across a bridge, and you coudl retrieve parts from a broken down car, and a house nearby.
No it wasnt silent hill, or any popular game like that. It was made by one person I think, and he was very christian so at the end of the game you could email him and discuss anything you wanted. Also he had a website setup with forums to help if you got stuck.  </TEXT>
