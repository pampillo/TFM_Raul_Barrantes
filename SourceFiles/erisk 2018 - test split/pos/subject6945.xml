<TEXT> Current cutter here, I have borderline personality disorder. Attempted suicide in October of 2015. 

Cutting is a release. It's a way to deal with your problems. It almost feels validating. It feels like you deserve the pain. 

It makes me feel good. As shitty as that sounds. It makes me feel okay with myself. It's what I get for being the way I am. 

I wish I could stop. I really do. I did alright for a while. Then I get back into a rut and I'm back to it again. 

:(  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmmm. Favorite overall is definitely VII. 

However I really like X's battle system the best. 

I like VIII but haven't played it in years, I started IX and didn't really enjoy it, probably going to pick it up again once I finish my play through of VII. 

Just started VI and I'm already really interested in it. I'm only 20 minutes in but the world is really interesting and the music and sprites/art design are great. 

Also have V that I'm looking forward to starting soon. 

TLDR - VII is my favorite but X has my favorite battle system.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like I said above, not living up to the hype might not have been the best way to put it. It's just hard to evaluate if his performance is due to himself or the guys around him. Either way he's a solid guard and still has a high ceiling, but as I said I'm glad we used our first rounder on Jones instead of Collins.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with him being solid. But leading up to the draft he was being spoken of as one of the best offensive linemen in the draft. He may very well be, but it's hard to say for certain when you're playing next to 3 All Pro linemen. (Not that it's his fault who is in the trenches with him) let's just say I'm glad we used that first round pick on Jones instead of Collins.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the 2015 Draft the Cowboys selected Byron Jones with their first round pick, Randy Gregory in the second round (who was considered a first round talent until his stock dropped after a failed drug test) and they signed La'el Collins after he went undrafted (also a projected first round talent, who went undrafted due to a domestic violence investigation). 

Thus, when the draft and subsequent signings were over, some Cowboy fans claimed they won the draft because they had "three first round picks." As in, 3 guys that were all projected to go in the first that miraculously fell into our lap.  

Now it's a joke because Gregory's career is pretty much done with, and while Collins has a lot of potential he hasn't really stood out (not saying he's bad, he just hasn't met the hype yet IMO). However Jones is very promising, and is looking to be one of the centerpieces of our defense for years to come.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I get why people would be pessimistic about his ability coming back from an injury like this, but shit talking users (not even. Cowboy fans, I've seen other fans talk about how they think he'll end up performing well in the future) is just annoying. 

On the flip side people acting like he's gonna be the next Patrick Willis is equally as annoying. 

I just hope he doesn't end up like Bobby Fucking Carpenter.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed. Started with 4 Played them all up until IW. 

CoD 4 - was pretty good, really new type of game for its time. 

W@W - One of my favorites. Great maps and my favorite story mode. 

MW2 - My favorite one but I definitely have rose tinted glasses on. Played it again a while ago and it was just awful. To many killstreaks and the death streaks were annoying as well. I do miss collecting emblems and titles though. 

Skipped MW3 

Black Ops 1 - Solid game. Liked the money system for unlocks and the gambling system for Gun Game, Sharpshooter and Sticks and Stones. 

Ghosts? Was this one next? The campaign was fun but I remember the Time To Kill in multiplayer was so off that I never played it. 

Black Ops 2 - I have the guide in hardcover format, a journal with the logo on it, and the game for PS3 in a metal case, I honestly couldn't tell you a thing about it. 

Skipped Advanced Warfare 

Black Ops 3 - The last one I was really into. It was fun. Not many complaints tbh.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you could MAYBE argue top ten. But no way could you do top 5. I'd have:

Rice
Hutson
Moss
Owens
Harrison
Largent
Carter
Fitzgerald
Brown
Irvin

Now I could see someone putting Megatron in front of Fitzy, Brown and/or Irvin, but I have the first two ahead of him for the sole purpose of longevity and I have Irvin ahead of him for being one of the key pieces of the Cowboys dynasty and also for being arguably the most physically dominating receiver of all time (think Dez mixed with Brandon Marshall if you've never seen Irvin play). One could argue that Irvin has worse stats and I would agree but his career was cut short due to injury. 

I would also probably put Steve Smith Sr ahead of Megatron but that's just me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Currently work as a cook in a nursing home kitchen. 

In October I was sick with bronchitis, was sent home on Sunday, didn't go in Monday and went to the doctor. I was put on antibiotics and told not to come to work for 3 days (with doctors note). Went back in on Friday and was promptly written up by my boss for using more sick days than I was allotted (I only get 4 a year). 

It's ridiculous. I'm instructed by my doctor not to go to work because I could still be contagious. Mind you, I work in a KITCHEN for a NURSING HOME. Probably one of the most high risk places for a sick person to work in considering the lives at risk, and I still get in trouble for it. 

The best part? Couple weeks ago a girl I work with started to get a tingling feeling and the whole left side of her body went numb. She was rushed to the ER and stuff and ended up being out for over a week (mind you, after the second day she was on Snapchat and instagram posting pictures of her drinking/smoking/partying) and she didn't get in trouble for it because she was "sicker" than I was. 

Before anyone asks, yes, this is in America. Fucking ridiculous.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You also have to factor in the defense being provided by 2012 CP3 though. He was First Team All Defense that year (not to mention First Team All NBA) and would be stuck on Curry the whole game. Now, that obviously still leaves KD and Harden who, now that I think about it, would be guarded by two first team All Defense players in Lebron and Kobe respectively. 

I think the older team wins because the advantage they have in defense FAR outweighs the advantage that present day has on offense. All in all it would be interesting to say the least. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Definitely back then.

A team of

1) Paul/Rose
2) Kobe/Wade
3) KD
4) Lebron
5) Dwight

Would absolutely dominate. CP3 and Lebron could be the main distributors to Kobe and KD and they would also be great scoring options on top of it. Then you would have Rose and Wade coming off of the bench along with Howard shutting down whoever tried to drive into the post. 

Now that's not to say that the current team wouldn't perform, but the defense on the current team doesn't even come close IMO. The only players with defense well enough to slow down his man would be Kawhi and AD. Prime CP3, Rose, Dwight and Dwade along with a younger Lebron and pre injury Kobe would be very very difficult to stop.

But that's also assuming the matchups are going to be the ones I'm thinking of. It's all subjective really, you can't go wrong with either team but I think the older team would come out on top (I might also have a bit of rose tint on my glasses, admittedly).

In summation, again, my opinion:

Offensively the first team is more explosive, but they would also have a lot of trouble not only maintaining the explosiveness but also trying to keep up with the playmaking, defense and star power of the old team. However, the old team would have their hands full as well on defense, but I think their defense would prevail.

Nice post OP! I hope we get a lot of discussion on here. It's always interesting to here comparisons between eras.

<TEXT> Class of '14 here. Noticed that even when in high school.

I partied a lot, did drugs, but also got my work done and never got in really big trouble.

College was a wake up call but oh well. Been in an out of industrial contracts and am currently working in the healthcare field.

A lot of the kids below my age (and some that even are my age) are...squishy. They remind of that Jerry slug thing from Rick and Morty. They cave in to authority and don't want to disappoint even the most insignificant of people.

My younger sister for example is soon to be Class of '18 and she's the exact opposite and so are her friends. They're glued to their phones or laptops, they're scared to go out of their comfort zone and if anything so much as sneezes on their personal bubble they go into full on panic mode. 

My sister has quit two different jobs since turning sixteen because she messed up somehow and broke down in tears.

I just don't get it man. Even 4 years of difference is crazy. I remember every Friday and Saturday there was a party to go to, Sunday was the recovery day and Monday morning before the bell rang was when all the cliques got together and hung out and chatted about their weekends.

A few weeks ago I went to my high school for the day to visit all of my old teachers and such and I didn't see any of what I mentioned above. Kids were in the library frantically catching up on their homework, nobody was talking in the hall way together, and there was an eerie silence in the halls in between all of the periods.

I'm not sure if it's because these kids had almost always had social media and such (I didn't have a Facebook until 2011, I don't use twitter/snapchat/instagram at all really). My sister had all of those different social media accounts before she was even in high school and thats how they do everything. Very strange.

It all boils down to that comfort zone thing IMO. Like my uncle had always told me, "There's no growth in the comfort zone and there's no comfort in the growth zone." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been watching First Take for years now and while I wasn't every the biggest fan of Stephen A it took until just now to realize why I can't stand him.

Backstory: I lived in an apartment for the past 4 months with no cable which means no ESPN/First Take/Mike and Mike/Russilo and Kanell, today was the first day where I got to watch First Take before work due to having ESPN again.

Ignore the constant race card pulling, the stupid faces he makes when Max/Skip are talking, the constant talking over everybody, his annoying as shit cadence, my biggest problem with Stephen A Smith is that he is not good at debating or explaining his opinions.

Today I've seen him and Max talk about Desean Jackson and Brandon Marshall. He compares Eli Manning to Aaron Rodgers without explaining his reasoning. Max tries to dissect that point and Stephen A is just being a whiny bitch basically going "La la la I can't hear you." He states that the Cowboys are "The gift that keeps on giving because they always do bad so I look like a genius." Again, when Max asks him to explain his reasoning he goes back to the "La la la I can't hear you" tactic. 

The best part, when he does finally explain his reasoning he sounds incoherent and his argument is chock full of backpedaling and outlandish statements.

If he would act mature and treat First Take like the debate show that it is I'm sure a lot of people wouldn't mind him, but as it stands he's a has-been talking head with his head so far up his own ass he can chew his lunch twice on the way down.

Recently I've been trying to play it again and now I can barely run it on low. Is there a reason for that? I had uninstalled it a few months ago and only just reinstalled this past Sunday. Is there something I can do to get the game running well again? I'm not too concerned with quality. I just want to be able to actually play. I'm getting sub 30 FPS and severe input lag.

<TEXT> it depends on your definition of GOAT. To me, Kareem is the GOAT as far as career goes. Probably the undisputedly best college player ever and has the career accolades and numbers to support him being the GOAT NBA player. On r/NFL you see people argue Moss over Rice because of physical dominance and peak and I feel like it's the same thing with MJ and KAJ.

<TEXT> Last night was double date night for my GF my roommate and his girlfriend. 

We watched:

*The Exorcist 3*

Pretty good honestly. Very tense, atmospheric and after that one jump scare my GF had her head in my chest for the next 20 minutes. Very surprised this one isn't talked about enough. Enjoyed it as much or even a bit more than the original. 

*Banshee Chapter* 

Holy. Shit. This movie was something. From the creepy stress inducing intro to the jump scares that we're just right. The Hunter S Thompson-like character and the sound design. I really liked this movie. Filled me with a sense of dread I haven't felt since the first time I watched Sinister. 

Speaking of...

*Sinister*

The girls hadn't seen this yet, it's in my top 5 for horror movies all time. The music, the acting, the reveal of Bughuul, everything about this movie was great imo except for the scene with that one scene with Ethan Hawke and the children. Love this movie. Love love love love it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly? The Eagles. As much as I despise them, their fans, and everything they represent, the city of Philadelphia needs a title. 

Just kidding. 

Redskins. My uncle is a huge redskins fan and I'd love to be able to see the look on his face when they win, he has an inoperable tumor and doesn't have many years left. Actually, fuck Uncle George. 

Let's go with the Giants. I think it'd be funny if Eli ended his career with more rings than Peyton.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Then keep the other team from scoring. 

If a team truly deserves to win then they should have no problem keeping the other team out of the end zone so the offense has a chance to win the game. 

Don't give up a blatant PI call in OT in the most important game of your life.

Don't blow a 25 point lead in the most important game of your life. 

The OT rules are fine. The only reason people are pissed is because the Patriots won again. 

Nobody says shit when this happens in the regular season. Or when it has happened to the Packers 2 (maybe 3) times in the playoffs in the past years since the rule change. It's only because it was the Super Bowl. 

I'd rather have the NFL OT rules than the NCAA. Start every drive at what the 25? Fuck that. Flip a coin, if you get the ball score a touchdown. If you don't, get the ball back and score. 

In a perfect world they'd play a whole extra quarter like NHL playoffs IIRC but that's too much risk for an already dangerous sport and the brass would never approve that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks man! And I agree. Dak didn't look like a rookie last night. I can't wait to see him next year. 

I'll try and answer these the best I can. 

1) I know we have Tyron signed until 2020, but his cap hit is gonna be a problem in two years. Fredbeard and Martin will be signed soon because their rookie deals are ending. 

2) Pass rush. Without a doubt. Implying we keep Claiborne and Barry Church, Brandon Carr doesn't retire and Byron Jones improves our secondary will be pretty good. They played very well this year and if they all stay then I don't see why they wouldn't improve. 

3) PPR I'd have to go with Shady simply because Dez doesn't get many receptions, although I could be wrong as far as stat comparisons go. I don't play in a PPR league (although my commissioner is going to bring up changing it at our leagues next get together) by I don't think Dez would be an advantage. I would go with Beasley before Dez in a PPR league personally.

<TEXT> Grandfather is a Giants fan from Queens. When my dad was little he rooted for the Cowboys (during the Don Meredith and Roger Staubach years) to make my grandfather mad. Dad stayed a Cowboys fan and I became one when he got me into the Triplets and Landry and Staubach when I was little. 

It was cemented when I was 11 and at the Cowboys vs Bills game in Buffalo. Nick Folk kicked a 54(?) yard field goal in the final seconds that was iced, then he kicked the redo even prettier than before, right down the middle. 

I've been going to a Dallas game every other year since. In the off years we go see the Patriots and Bills play because the pats are my Grandmothers favorite team (she's from Boston).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was asked who I was going to root for after Dallas lost yesterday. I knew my answer straight off. 

The Patriots. 

Always the Patriots. 

I want to watch every sports pundit, every journalist every non Pats fan on every brand of sports media cry out in agony as the Patriots win their 5th title. 

I want to see YouTube videos of kids in steeler jerseys and Falcons jerseys and packer jerseys alike crying because their favorite team didn't win it all. 

The Patriots are my second team exactly for that reason. One of the greatest dynasties of all time and nobody appreciates that (other than you guys). It seems like once a week ESPN or whoever is trying to poke hole in the Patriots, make them seem like they're washed up, but they just keep killing it. And I love you guys for that. 

I want Brady to cement his legacy as the GOAT (even though we all know he already has). 

I live in Syracuse, New York. Place is crawling with Jets, Giants, Eagles, Bills and Steeler fans. I want them all to suffer.

The only team that gets hated on as much (if not more than) Dallas is New England and I don't want any of you guys to deal with all of the "Fuck you Fuck Dallas" types messages popping up on my phone and on my news feed. 

I want every meme during this offseason to flame all other 31 teams for not being able to stop Brady and BB again. 

That's the only thing that will satisfy me. 

When the world burns after they win, I'll be the first one to play in the ashes. 

Fuck the Bills. Fuck the Bears. Fuck the Bengals. Fuck the Buccaneers. Fuck the Chargers. Fuck the Chiefs. Fuck the Colts. Fuck the Dolphins. Fuck the Eagles. Fuck the Falcons. Fuck the 49ers. Fuck the Jets. Fuck the Jaguars. Fuck the Packers. Fuck the Panthers. Fuck the Lions. Fuck the Giants. Fuck the Raiders, Rams and Ravens. Fuck the Saints. Fuck the Texans. Fuck the Steelers. Fuck the Vikings. Fuck the Redskins. Fuck the Browns. Fuck the Seahawks. Fuck the Cardinals. 

Go Patriots.

<TEXT> I deleted Facebook off of my my phone after the game specifically because everyone is jerking it to the final score. It makes me think of how boring other people's lives have to be to hate on Dallas for entertainment. 

I can even post a "GG Packers" without getting flamed on FB. 

I thought I was immature. But there are legitimate adults cussing me out on Facebook for being a Dallas fan. 

Feels bad man, I'm only 20 so they haven't been champions since before I was born and I still get shit for it. 

But it'll be okay, because one day we'll be on top again and it will be fucking glorious. I'm never gonna stop bringing up our next super bowl win. Fuck all the haters. WeDemBoys

<TEXT> Like /u/horrorshowjack had said, Irvin retired in the top ten in receptions and yards. However, he was also one of the Cowboys "Triplets" that won 3 Super Bowls. 

He was one of (if not THE) most aggressive receiver of his time. It didn't matter where the ball was, if it was anywhere near him he was going to find a way to catch it. They didn't call him the Playmaker for nothing. This was all also in an era where receivers were getting mauled down the field during the play. 

Also, he had 5 Pro Bowls and 3 AP awards (one first team and two second team). </TEXT>

<TEXT> $250,000 is more than double what my parents house is worth, so I'd say it'd be a pretty good one here. 

My grandmothers is worth about half a million and that's a 4 bedroom 3 bathroom with an inground pool, two car garage, a furnished basement and a pretty big backyard with a pond in the back. 

I think my uncles old house was worth about 200k and was 3 bed 2 bath with an above ground pool, 2 car garage. 

I'd say somewhere in that range. I'd say a $250,000 where I live would get you one of the nicer houses in the city. 

I live in a small college near Lake Ontario for reference.  </TEXT>

The story is cool. The game is beautiful. The characters are great. But I cannot stand the combat. 

It felt too button mashy for me. Like I was just trying to press square faster than the AI could attack me.

<TEXT> I was surprised tbh. That game against you guys showed that Zeke and the Oline CAN be stopped, but it also showed that there is more to the Dallas Offense than Zeke. 

For what it's worth, I think you guys have the best D in the league. Weddle was a great signing by you guys, any word on Jimmy Smith? If he's healthy you guys will be able to slow down anybody.

<TEXT> I think it'll probably even out if he gets more carries as the season goes on, but as it stands this year he's only averaging 3.8 YPC which is half a yard less than his career average. 

Obviously it doesn't mean much seeing as he only has 61 carries, but it's not great considering some people think "anyone can behind that Oline." Evidently Morris hasn't been doing well. 

That being said, I don't think he's mediocre.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This isn't a shit post or troll post. I'm genuinely curious. 

Before I stopped playing CSGO (around April 2015) I was GN Master. I finally got my rank back two nights ago after getting to Rank 2 and it put me in silver 1. 

Now I understand there's rank decay and all, but is that normal? 

I'm stuck in silver now and I don't want to brag but it isn't even fun. My friends and I were all GN 3/Master and we're all in low silver. Games end in 20-30 minutes and we'll be in the 60s or 70s as far as our score goes. 

Ive played about 10 matches since then, winning all of them and being top two in the scoreboard in each one and I've only gotten to Silver 2. 

Is there a "Rank match" where I only rank up after X amount of wins? If so that's understandable. I don't mind playing more seeing as I'm going to be playing a few games after work every day anyway. I just want to know why it takes so long. 

And again, this isn't a troll. And I might be complaining a bit but I'm just confused.

Larry Allen just because I want to see Zeke rush for 2500 yards. 

Irvin (or Terrell Owens if he counts) so we can have an elite WR across from Dez. 

Emmitt Smith for a two headed monster rushing attack. 

Defense: 

Charles Haley, Randy White ,Too Tall Jones or Bob Lilly for Dline help. 

Deion Sanders or Darren Woodson for secondary help. 

Demarcus Ware for pass rush :( 

Special Teams: 

Raghib Ismail for kick and punt returns. 

If I had to pick one it'd be Ware so long as we got him in his prime, if not then I'd really like to see Irvin across from Dez.  </TEXT>

If you want a great all around TE that can block AND catch you'll want Witten. 

If you want a great receiving TE whose only flaw is his blocking you'll want Tony G. 

To each their own, I think Tony G is one of the greatest TEs ever, but I don't think he's head and shoulders above Witten. It's a lot closer than people think.  </TEXT>

Gore probably could eventually, but he also played in an era that included LdT, AP and Faulk (iirc, not sure when Faulk retired). 

I'd say Gore has a better chance than Davis. To a lot of people Davis seemed like a Flash in the Pan so to speak.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to try it out anyway. 

I'm one of the only people in my friend circle that bothered playing any of the Deadrising games past 2 and to be honest I like them all in their own way. 

1 is a classic imho. 

Chop Till You Drop was interesting to say the least. Probably the weakest one in the series, but still fun nonetheless. 

2 and Off the Record had the weapon crafting and coop. 

I really liked 3 due to the map and I have it on PC so the amount of bloodshed I could have at once was a treat. I would agree with other commentors that the weapon combos got a bit crazy in this one. 

I never really played coop, I mostly use video games as a way to escape everything and everybody, so this isn't a big issue for me. 

However. 

I'm hearing all of these things about Frank West being different and I hope it's not true. A comment or on this post said,"So it's just another guy named Frank?" And if that's the case I'm going to be disappointed. 

The whole point of Capcom adding Frank back to the mix was to appeal to fans of the first that missed his awkward black humor and little catchphrases. 

Too much of a good thing is a bad thing, and if this game flops it'll just prove that Capcom should've left it alone. 

I'm still going to wait for some reviews and Let's Plays before I decide to spend money on this iteration. I'm hoping it turns out well, but every article I read paints it in a darker light.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you actually! I was about to ask that next. 

I could be wrong, but I think his play would be more accepted if he played the 3. The rebounding would seem to low for a guy playing the 4 or 5, and the points and assists would be low for a guy playing the 1 or 2. 

I'd like to see other people's opinions on this too!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> How valuable would a player that averaged a 5x5 be? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Title explains, if I have to add more due to rules I will, but I'm genuinely curious. 

Mind you, he would still only average 5 points, but he's even more valuable when you factor in the fact that he would also be getting 5 assists, rebounds, blocks and steals a game. 

Would he be the ultimate role player?

Would he make any team he was on objectively better? 

What sort of contract would he be offered? 

I'd like to see what you guys think!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> What NFL teams have the least amount of following in their local areas? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-07 21:06:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Sorry if the title is /r/titlegore material but Ill explain further here. 

Basically, what NFL teams are out on the backburner for other franchises or teams in their area. 

My uncle lives in Atlanta and says that nobody really pays attention to the Falcons and it's more of a UGA or GT fandom with the NFL fans supporting whatever team they rooted for before moving to Atlanta (considering a lot of people there are transplants). 

Are there any other teams like that?

Are the Titans overshadowed by the Volunteers?

Do the Wild and Vikings have to compete for ratings? 

What about the Lions and the Wolverines/Red Wings? 

Maybe even the Saints and LSU? 

I would also assume that there are fans in Texas that favor the Longhorns or even high school football over the Cowboys. 

This isn't meant to sound pretentious or anything, I'm genuinely curious. As someone that is a Cowboys fan first and an NFL fan second it's weird to me to think about other sports overtaking my Cowboys fandom. 

Thanks in advance and I hope for a good discussion!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Liberation of Skyrim quest broken. Any known fixes? I've tried everything. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-07 19:52:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey all! I've been playing Skyrim: SE for PC and have had absolutely zero problems until the past few days.

You see, I started the Civil War quest by joining the Stormcloaks. Survived the Ice Wraith, Completed the Jagged Crown, and liberated Whiterun. Jarl Baalgruff (sp?) is not longer the Jarl so on and so forth. 

The next objective I had was to report to Ulfric, and there is NOTHING THAT INITIATES THE NEXT QUEST! I've tried every single dialogue option, I've tried waiting, I've tried only talking to him when he's sitting in the throne, I've tried using console commands to advance the quest, I've tried using console commands to reset the quest, I've even tried traveling to the next area with hope that Galmar would be there ready to initiate the quest, but to no avail there is nothing that seems to fix it.

Am I completely boned? Because if so I'm pretty pissed off. 

Even with its repetitiveness and faults, the Civil War questline is one of my favorites in the entire game. I love raiding the forts, I love saving the prisoners, I love the espionage, everything about the civil war quest line is worth me trying endlessly to get it to work.

The only thing left for me to do is to reload a previous save, and I am NOT about to do that. I did the first few quests for the Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood and did the quests for Clavicus Vile, Molag Bol, Hircine, found Meridias Beacon and finished the Forsworn Conspiracy before starting the Civil War quest, I'm not about to do all of those quests again just to do the civil war (no matter how much I love it).

If you ask me, this is a bit ridiculous. You'd think that since they remastered the game they'd at least try and fix a few of the bugs that were prevalent in the original release. 

Anyway I digress, is there anything else I can do? Or do I HAVE to restart from a previous save? Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

Tied. 

If DT didn't have that drop on third down it would've been in the bag. 

The worst part? 

It counts as a loss for me. I'm not sure why. But I'm livid right now. 

I tied and Jamaal Charles gave me 0 points. 

I could have played Stefon Diggs instead and I would've won.

I could've played Coby Fleener instead and I would've won.

The bright side is im still in second place in the league, but the guy I tied with is the Ruxin of my league, dead wife and all, minus the success in fantasy football. I cannot stand him. 

Fuck you Mark. Fuck you Elizabeth. I'm going to fuck your husband in the playoffs so hard you're going to roll over in your grave because even though you had juicy tits and a fat ass he's never going to be as satisfied as he will be with me.

I talk about my feelings all the time. It makes it easier to deal with them. It makes me feel normal if I am able talk to people about it. 

I used to bottle them up, and drink a lot, and do pills a lot. But now I'll hang out with my friends and they'll always make sure I'm doing okay. 

I don't like the double standard with men's emotions. The amount of times I was ignored is disgusting. The amount of times I was told to "man up" is disgusting. I cut out a lot of people because they had attitudes like that and my life has steadily improved since. 

The idea that men need to be stoic because they're men is ignorant.

<TEXT> Hi everyone! I'm going to be trying LSD tonight. I have a few questions. 

1) Will I have a problem going to work tomorrow night if I trip tonight? 

1b) is there a hangover or afterglow that I should be worried about? 

2) anything I should have out ahead of time? Such as water or snacks? 

3) will video games be out of the question? Will I be too far gone to play something like Rocket League or Madden? 

4) I'm experienced in dissociatives and psilocybin, in what ways is LSD similar to those? 

5) what are the "unwritten rules" of LSD? Things to look out for that a new comer wouldn't exactly be familiar with. 

6) how do I take it? Do I eat it or put it on my tongue and let it dissolve? I have no idea.

I mostly watch it because it brings me back to my childhood. I remember watching family guy as a kid and seeing it now is astounding. I try to cling to things from my childhood. I like the comedic style personally. And some of the jokes in the newest season are actually pretty dark. 

I still much prefer South Park. 

How like have a been typing? 

Idk. 

I feeel like family guy is trying to go more against the grain. But they aren't doing it right. 

They don't have the characters for it in my opinion. 

It's kind of disappointing.

<TEXT> I'm going to be completely honest. I thought that Arizona was going to clobber you guys. (When you factor in the fact that Gronk, Brady and Solder were  out, you were on the road in week one and Garapollo was starting his first game)

But holy shit. You guys pulled it off. If my grandfather were still alive he'd  still be cheering (and it's almost 3am lol)

I'm very scared to see what you guys do this year, considering that Arizona is one of the favorites to win the NFC. 

Anyway, that's all. Have a nice week everybody! Until next time! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was in Kindergarten. I was released from class within a half hour of the second plane hitting. I remember coming home and my whole family was there trying to get through to my uncle who worked at the WTC. He actually had the day off. Crazy how it all works like that. 

I remember I even had some of my neighbors over, very strange. 

The whole neighborhood stuck together after that. My dad actually had most of the neighborhood over to watch football today. 

That's definitely one of the silver linings. Unity.

The heroes I've been doing the best with are: Pharah, Genji, Roadhog, Zenyatta and Bastion. 

The ones I've been awful with are: Widowmaker, Tracer, Winston and McCree. 

Any tips for a new comer that wants to be at least average with all the heroes? 

Any tricks with any characters that the game doesn't tell you about? 

Also what are the coins for? 

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<TEXT> MyFantasyLeague, 10 team, keeper, snake.

1QB, 2-3 HB, 2-3 WR, 1-2 TE, 1PK, 1D/ST

QB: Brees, Bortles, Prescott, Tannehill
HB: Jamaal Charles, David Johnson, Jeremy Hill
WR: OBJ, Demaryius Thomas, Maclin, Larry Fitz, Stefon Diggs, Kevin White
TE: Coby Fleener, Martellus Bennett
PK: Justin Tucker
D/ST: Bengals

Notes: 

I kept David Johnson from last season

Took OBJ with the first pick

I have 4 QBs due to critical error, I read Bortles' bye week wrong, thought it was week 6, it isn't. It's the same week as Brees' so I took Prescott and Tannehill near the end of the draft. 

Did that fuck up my team? I feel like my team is pretty solid. But then again everyone feels that way the day after their draft.  </TEXT>

Had a friend tell me it was a movie about two brothers commuting heinous crimes while trying to get out of the US through Mexico. He didn't tell me a thing about the vampires. 

I loved the first 45 minutes. As soon as the vampires showed up I realized I made a huge mistake. 

It isn't terrible, but I felt like I wasted my time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Witcher 3. I watch my friends play it, and it looks awesome, I watch people on YouTube play it and it looks awesome, I read about how awesome it is on here and when I played it (mind you I've tried 3 times since it came out) it just seems bland. 

I don't find Geralt interesting in the slightest. Every other character was just an asshole, and all of the quests that people were telling me were so fun and interesting were just fetch quests. 

I mean shit the witcher sense just turns the game into a scavenger hunt, and to me it's not fun at all.

I haven't watched much of AGS, I'll have to check him out.

The Kayplays sounds fun to watch! It'll be like living out DkS1 again!

I like VaatiVidya a lot, I recently just started watching TheDemodcracy(sp?) and I enjoy his community rank videos and personal opinions on bosses. 

OnlyAfro is a guilty pleasure of mine too, even though some of his videos are hit or miss.

Thank you! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Round 1: Pinwheel vs. Prowling Magus and Congregation

PM and C

Round 2: Pontiff Sulyvahn vs. Raime, the Fume Knight

Sulyvahn

Round 3: Velstadt, the Royal Aegis vs. Executioner Smough (If Smough gets 8/10 stomped or more, give him an Ornstein.)

I think without Ornstein Velstadt takes it 8/10, with Ornstein it's Pikachu and Snorlax 6/10

Round 4: Champion Gundyr vs. Knight Artorias (If Gundyr gets 8/10 stomped or more, give him an Iudex Gundyr.)

Even with Iudex I think Artorias stomps. 


Round 5: Darklurker vs. Dark Sun Gwyndolin

Gwndolin was one of the most difficult bosses in the game for me personally. So him. 

Round 6: Three Ruin Sentinels vs. Dragonslayer Armour (If the Ruin Sentinels get 8/10 stomped or more, give them a fourth Ruin Sentinel.)

Gotta go with Dragonslauer Armour

Round 7: Aldrich, Devourer of Gods vs. Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight (If Aldrich gets 8/10 stomped or more, give him a Gwyndolin.)

In their primes? I guess Gwyn either way. 

Round 8: Burnt Ivory King vs. Vordt, of the Boreal Valley (If Vordt gets 8/10 stomped or more, give him another Vordt.)

Ivory King, both ways. 

Round 9: Twin Princes vs. Afflicted Graverobber, Ancient Soldier Varg and Old Explorer Cerah

Twin princes. 

Round 10: Sir Alonne vs. Champion Gundyr

Gundyr

Round 11: Ornstein and Smough vs. Throne Defender and Watcher (If O S get 8/10 stomped or more, give them another Ornstein.)

Again. In their primes I'm going with O S

Round 12: Crystal Sage vs. Moonlight Butterfly

Crystal Sage

Round 13: Iron Golem vs. Dragonslayer Armour

Armour

Round 14: On-foot Nameless King vs. Raime, the Fume Knight (If Nameless King gets 8/10 stomped or more, give him his Dragon.)

Nameless King, by God. 

Round 15: King Vendrick vs. Manus, Father of the Abyss

Manus. 

Round 16: Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight vs. King Vendrick

Gwyn

Round 17: Dancer of the Boreal Valley vs. Knight Artorias (If Dancer gets 8/10 stomped or more, give her a Vordt.)

Artorias either way. 

Round 18: Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight vs. King Vendrick vs. Soul of Cinder

Gwyn, again. 

Personally I feel like the most powerful characters are out of Dark Souls 1 with Gwyn, Artorias and Manus. DkS1 is very top heavy. 

If you go by game difficulty it's a different story. But a lot of people would go by the game they played first I think. 

Nice post! I love From Software games.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh boy. Gin is my absolute favorite. 

Try a Tom Collins. 

One part Lemon juice, 2 part Gin, 2 part tonic, 1 part simple syrup (I personally put in a teaspoon of sugar and stir). 

Then work your way down to gin and juice (whether it cranberry or orange or even pineapple. Grapefruit juice is good as well) 

Then gin and tonics. 

The problem a lot of people have with gin in my experience is the aftertaste, but when you have the gin aftertaste along with the aftertaste of a fruit juice it evens out to make a nice smooth flavor. 

I may or may not be intoxicated ATM so I apologize. 

Tanguerey all the way.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Aliens: Colonial Marines. 

It was supposed to be THE Alien game. There were gonna be squad mechanics, RNG factors and different classes. You were gonna be able to explore Hadley's Hope and be a Xeno killing badass. 

Then the game actually came out and it was a watered down Call of Duty with Aliens thrown in (with some of the worst AI I've ever seen personally). 

Extremely disappointing. The worst was that my dad bought it for the two of us to play together and we played for about an hour and gave up. 

I ended up beating it with one of my friends and that was the only fun I had really. 

The multiplayer was fun but it didn't last long.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If I'm being completely honest I don't like Steph because I'm jealous that he isn't on the Clippers. 

He's the perfect underdog story. People passed on him in the draft and said he'd never make it in the NBA, ends up winning back to back MVPs (one of them the first ever undisputed MVP) and brings a title to Golden State. 

Another reason I don't like him is because I'd been trying to get friends and family into basketball for years and they were never into it, now all of a sudden they're all Warriors fans and claim Steph to be the GOAT. 

It's funny because since the Warriors lost in the finals those same people are saying he's overrated. Smh. 

TLDR : I don't like him because he's good.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do any of you feel guilty for trying to better yourself? 

I do. Every day. 

I try and exercise. Play guitar. Play video games. Hang out with friends. I try and do everything I used to do that used to put me in a better mood. 

But when I eventually get into a better mood and I see some of my friends, or co workers, or even my parents they all make me feel like the biggest piece of shit in the world for it. 

They say, "You're in a good mood today, I guess you're cured huh?" Or "I guess that mental breakdown at work was just for attention, I saw you on SnapChat having a good time the other night." Or (my favorite) "You only go to counseling so you get a free day off every week." 

But that's the thing. They only see the good moments. And those are few and far in between. 

They don't see me staying in bed motionless until I can get the energy to even brush my teeth. 

They don't see me struggle. 

They don't see me. 

Maybe they do, who knows. I feel like a lot of people I know are in denial about it because I never used to be this way. 

It doesn't matter. 

I'm getting help, and I'm getting the fuck out of this town once I'm better.

Yankees because I live in Central New York but I don't really watch baseball. 

As far as College sports I had family that went to SU and Michigan so I root for those two teams. Plus I'm about 30 minutes from the Dome so SU is basically my home team. 

I've been rooting for Djoker in tennis since before he was in the top ten. Probably my favorite athlete of all time. 

NASCAR is Jeff Gordon and now that he's retired I root for Kasey Kahne (met him over the summer, great guy).

<TEXT> I expected it as well due to the fact that PS3 allowed it. At first you could share digital games with as many consoles as you wanted so long as your account was on them. I remember I got a bunch of my friends in middle school into the Bad Company 2 Closed Beta that way. A few years later they lowered it to 2 or 3 consoles per account. 

Considering digital downloads are more popular now than they were ~2008/2009 I shouldn't have been surprised that they stopped allowing people to do that. I remember my PS3 had more games on it that weren't mine than games that actually were.  </TEXT>

How good of a prospect is he? I know he's apparently one of the best in the past few years but does anyone have any comparisons for me? Is he a player that a coach can build a team around around him like AD or Blake?

<TEXT> I don't know a lot about players from before the 90's, but these are the ones I think would dominate if they played today:

Marino - It's a full on passing league now. I feel like he'd be putting up numbers similar if not better than Prime Manning. 

Deion Sanders - He would still be able to shut down any receiver in the game IMO. Think Revis with Patrick Peterson athleticism (but even better). 

Barry Sanders - Put him on an Oline like Green Bay, Washington or Dallas and he would take over seasons, let alone games.

Bo Jackson - Probably the most physically gifted player of all time, you could realistically place him anywhere and he'd kill it. 

Jerry Rice - Best footwork, hands, and IQ in a wide receiver ever. Plus he can use gloves now and doesn't have to worry about stickum /s but seriously he would do great. 

Players that have played recently that I think would do amazing:

Brian Urlacher - He had the pass coverage skills of a safety and is one of the best tacklers of all time. Place him anywhere honestly.

Watt, James Harrison, Suggs, Burfict, Suh - Place them in the 70's and people would probably die. 

I'll think of more later probably. Just got off work and I'm a little fried.

<TEXT> Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder. I was diagnosed my senior year of high school. When I tell people they look at my like a have six heads. I either get one of three responses,"You don't look like you have anything wrong with you." NO SHIT! It's a mental disorder you uncultured twit. Or I get,"You should hang out with me and do X, it'll cure you." No. No it won't. Or,"Huh, you're lucky, I wish I had a little voice in my head that made me work harder." NO! NO YOU FUCKING DON'T! It's torture. No matter what I do I have to do it right. Whether I'm at work, playing a video game, playing guitar or even getting ready for bed. If I even mess up a little bit I go into panic mode. I'm constantly asking questions and bothering my coworkers, I never get things done on time because I spend so long making sure every little detail is checked. I double, triple, sometimes quadruple check my work all day every day. 

It's not fun. It's not glamorous. Whenever I see someone out and about or on social media and they say something like,"I always have Oreos with my milk. it's just my OCD haha." No. Shut the fuck up. If you really had OCD or OCPD you wouldn't be laughing about it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Winslow, Gonzalez, Sharpe, Witten. 

Honorable mention to Gronk. I'll bump Witten off of the list of Gronk continues his level of production because I think Gronk can end up as the best ever. Heresy I know, but the problem with Witten is that Gonzalez and Gronk (and also Gates) are highlight reel level tight ends while Witten is a master work horse. I love Witten and think he is one of the best ever, I'd definitely take him over Gates but he's more of a (for lack of a better term) Emmitt Smith / Art Monk sort of player. Not really flashy but his consistence and hard work knows no bounds.  </TEXT>

What songs should I learn on acoustic that are simple but sound complex? I've been playing a lot of Elliot Smith and Conor Oberst if that helps at all. 

Also: what's a good low budget acoustic guitar? The one I'm using is a hand me down from my sister and it plays fine but I'm looking to get a new one soon but I'm not looking to spend much more than $150. 

Thanks in advance!  </TEXT>

COME. THE. FUCK. ON. 

I DONT CARE IF EVERY PICK AFTER THIS IS THE BEST AVAILABLE CORNER OR SAFETY IN THE DRAFT! I DONT CARE IF ZEKE ENDS UP BEING PHENOMANAL AND RAMSEY ENDS UP BEING TERRIBLE! I WILL EAT MY WORDS IF THAT ENDS UP HAPPENING BUT FOR THE TIME BEING IM FUCKING LIVID. 

GOD. FUCKING. DAMMIT. 

Edit: Now that I've taken 48 seconds to cool down I will be honest and say I am excited to see what he can do behind our line. I just really think CB is a bigger need. But if we're looking for immediate impact and trying to make our offense as efficient (or even more efficient) than 2014 I agree with the ZEKE pick.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Daphne is a girl that blends in with the furniture, so to speak. She's very plain on the outside. But you eventually become friends and talk to her multiple nights a week and realize she's actually interesting. You try to talk to your friends about her and realize that they've all been talking to her too, nothing serious however, she's just a very insightful girl with a lot to say about a lot of things. 

Your friends tell you there's something...different about her. But you don't care. You love talking to her anyway. She's always got great advice and accepts you for who you are. Whenever you talk to her she always seems to make your mood better. 

Eventually you fall for her and decide to hang out. Your first date is just dinner and a movie and it goes surprisingly well, you realize she's different in person. She doesn't talk as much and doesn't seem very interested, but that's not enough to give up on the future relationship yet. 

A few dates later you invite her over to your place. You turn on a movie and cuddle on the couch just enjoying each other's company. You start to think your friends were wrong. Daphne is a great girl, everyone's opinion is stupid. You start to really like her. 

You decide to take a step further and go all the way. The sex was bad and almost makes it not worth the wait, she completely changed afterward. She became verbally and mentally abusive . You're extremely disappointed and realize that even though you love being around her that a committed relationship probably won't work out. 

So you decide to break it off but still remain in contact. Once every few months you hook up again and feel great, but then you remember how she treated you and reel away.  </TEXT>

It's gotten to the point where my eyes strain when I wear my glasses. Is that to be expected? I've only done MDA a handful of times and don't remember anything like this happening before.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah. I was thinking of the nausea and the body load combined with MDA, I think if I do combine them it'll have to be a small dose of LSA. I'll try and do a CWE to try and get rid of as much nausea as possible.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Man :( I really really wanted Clippers v Warriors with both teams at full strength. Even though we don't match up perfectly against them I think it still would have been an awesome series. Now with Paul and Griffin injured the Blazers are favored to win the series and Pauls window to win a chip is closing. 

Hopefully the rest of this series will stay competitive. I've enjoyed it so far, but I really don't want any more superstars to get hurt, and that goes for every team in the playoffs.

<TEXT> Title is self explanatory. But I did LSA last Monday and combined it with cannabis as suggested by another redditor and had an amazing time. Yesterday I picked up some MDA that my friends and I are planning on doing for the NFL draft this week. I have enough HBWR seeds for all of us and was thinking of combining the two. 

Would one overpower the other? Or would it be too intense of a high that it wouldn't be worth it? 

Any advice on ratio would be appreciated as well! Thanks in advance!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me it's hard to label a band as a sellout because there are some bands that change their sound as they mature. 

If you asked my Uncle he would say Pink Floyd sold out in the after the Wall. The Final Cut, Divison Bell and Momentary Lapse of Reason have songs that are a lot more "radio friendly" than their older stuff. I disagree, but Floyd is also my favorite band and I appreciate everything they've put out. 

There are obvious sell outs like Nickelback, Fall Out Boy and Metallica but my vote goes to Taylor Swift. 

Her first two albums are lyrically great. I don't like country at all but I never minded when Taylor came on the radio. Nowadays it seems that she's straight up Pop music and lost all of her lyrical integrity in favor of cash. 

All power to them though. There are some bands that treat music as art, two that come to mind are Porcupine Tree and Dream Theater. And there are some musicians that are in it for a buck. 

Sometimes I like to ask myself,"If I was in their shoes, would I stay loyal to my fans or would I chase the next check?" I'm honestly worried that I would end up picking the latter.

<TEXT> Let me start by saying I don't know a lot about the Black Keys. I listen to them a lot but don't know anything about them personally. 

The biggest thing I've noticed with the evolution of The Black Keys is they sounded a lot more raw and soulful in the beginning and their stuff from Brothers on sounds more refined but the songs are less unique. I still love all of their albums, but it got me thinking...does it sound different because they have the resources to explore different sounds within their music? Or is it more if they got commercial success and fame and changed their sound to keep said success and fame?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me it's a toss up between:

Deion Sanders- Arguably the GOAT CB for a position we need. 

Barry Sanders- Behind our line he would destroy. It would be fun as hell to watch. It'd also keep a lot of pressure and hits away from Romo. 

Jerry Rice- We need a solid #2 receiver. With Rice we would have Dez fill that hole. Along with Williams and Beasley our WR core would be set. 

Ed Reed- my personal favorite DB of all time. Church is consistent and Jones is shaping up to be good IMO but Wilcox has been shaky as of late. I think Reed and Church with Jones at Nickel would make our secondary a lot better.

<TEXT> I guess after Emmitt left for Arizona we didn't have a standout franchise guy. However we did have Greg Ellis and Roy Williams and they were both pro bowl players. I'm not sure when Witten would have been considered a franchise player but I would consider him as well. Bledsoe wasn't that bad for us and we've had Romo since then. Along with having TO and now Dez I think we'll be set for a while. 

I'd have to agree with /u/Chibears85 and say that the Bears went the longest without a franchise guy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some backround. In high school I never had a girlfriend, I was one of the "popular" kids but mostly just because I never had a problem getting drugs or alcohol for parties and people just like being around me, I'm a funny guy but I'm very distant emotionally. 

There was a girl that was one of my best friends growing up. We always had multiple classes all throughout middle and high school. We'll call this girl Mary. 

My junior prom I ended up taking a girl that I was completely enamored with. We'll call this girl Emily. 

Basically, prom with Emily was great. We went out to dinner at a nice restaurant and took a limo to prom. We were inseparable all night, took goofy pictures and slow dances and when we finally kissed she didn't leave my side the rest of the night. Instead of going to a post prom party we ended up going back to my house. We loaded up Netflix I made some nachos, packed a bowl and made a couple drinks and we just spent the whole night together. She ended up staying until about 3am and I took her home. I kissed her when we got to her doorstep and told her to text me when she gets up. 

She never did. 

She started acting very strange the rest of the weekend. I didn't think anything of it. I texted her Sunday night asking if something was wrong and she said,"I'm fine, I just don't think we should talk anymore." She basically dropped this bomb on me and telling me she only went to prom with me because she felt bad that nobody else would. One of the greatest nights of my life happened out of pity. 

I went to school the following Monday and met up with my friends to talk about our weekends. My friend Matt gives me a high five and asks me how it went when I took Emily home. I told him what happened and he laughed. "No seriously how was it?" And I broke down and told him everything, showed him the text messages and all. I ended up sitting in the hallway against the lockers with Matt and a few of our other friends. Emily walked by, saw me crying, looked at the friend she was walking with and just started laughing. 

It was the longest day of my life. On the bus home I was talking to Mary and I asked her,"How come everyone else is getting into relationships and I'm not? Is there something wrong with me? Nobody has a problem being friends with me but whenever I want anything more it blows up in my face."

And I'll never forget what she said. One of my best friends of my entire life. 

"subject6945, you're you. Why would anybody want to be with you? Sometimes I even wonder why I'm friends with you." 

Turns out a lot of my high school "friends" felt that way when none of them showed up to my grad party. I found out who my real friends were after graduating. And now, two years later, it still stings. 

But it's okay. I'm okay.  </TEXT>

I love Jim Boeheim. He's loved immensely by most everyone in central New York and if you've never had the chance to meet him you are missing out. He loves Syracuse and is incredibly down to earth and I don't know how I'm going to react when he retires. It might result in a lot of tears.

<TEXT> The problem I have with people saying Aikman shouldn't be in the Hall is the fact that they compare him to quarterbacks now. If you actually look at the 90s he was in the top ten for practically every passing statistic, on top of being the QB for a 3 time SB champion Cowboys team and playing in 16 playoff games. His statline for those 16 games:

11-5 320/502 CMP% 63.75 3,849 YDS 23-17 TD-INT

Along with a career playoff passer rating of 88.3, his career playoff numbers are enough to be a good looking 16 game season in today's pass friendly league.

The other thing is the obvious one, the way offenses were run was a lot different. Sure you had guys like Marino, Young, Elway, Favre and Montana putting up crazy stats, part of it is because they are all time greats, but the other part it because teams didn't know how to play against it due to the fact that not a lot of teams were constantly passing the ball. Instead of a handful or so teams in 2016 that primarily run the ball while the rest primarily pass the ball, it was a handful of so teams in the 90's that primarily passed as opposed to running. Aikman had pretty good stats for a team whose offense went through Emmitt Smith around 65% of the time.

My belief is that the Hall of Fame is reserved for players that cannot be ignored when talking about the history of the NFL. Anybody can use the stats argument for almost half of the players in the Hall of Fame, for example:

Art Monk: Sure he played 16 years, but he was only All Pro twice AND isn't even in the top 10 in any WR statistic despite playing for such a long time. You can say he only got in because of his three Super Bowls.

Lynn Swann: He retired with only 336 catches, 5,462 yards and 51 touchdowns. He's not even in the top 100 for any of his statistics let alone top 10. Oh wait, but he won a bunch of rings.

Joe Namath: Didn't even retire with a winning record. Some would say he's only in the Hall because he was "Broadway Joe."

For the record I don't actually believe any of the above players should not be in the hall. The point is, you can't tell the story of the NFL without Broadway Joe and the Jets winning the super bowl. You can't ignore Lynn "Literally Catches Everything" Swann and the Steelers dynasty. You can't ignore Art Monk, who was part of three Redskins super bowl winning teams that won with three different quarterbacks and it didn't matter who was throwing to him, he was going to put up numbers. You can't ignore the QB of the "Triplets," one of if not the most consistently dominant offense of the 90's.

TL;DR If you're going to use Aikmans stats against him as a Hall of Famer, do it to everyone else that played in a different era.

EDIT: Disregard the Art Monk statistic argument. /u/Khalil-Mack has told me that he retired with top five all time stats.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> More stuff in Freeside and the Strip, mostly Freeside. I understand the limitations on the engine but I wish there were more buildings in Freeside whether they be stores or shops or anything especially when you look at all of the destroyed buildings that are scattered about. Freeside is such a cool place but there isn't anything to keep me from spending any time there. 

The Strip is cool, I enjoy doing the quests for the casinos but there isn't anything keeping me there either. It just seems, idk, bland. Like there's something missing. 

Id rather have Freeside upgraded than the strip, jut because I feel like you can't really sense the tension with the NCR squatters feuding with the Kings or the Settlers because you only see like 10 people walking around, I inderstand that there's mods for it but afaik there aren't any mods to add shops or anything. 

NV is still my favorite game of all time, but there's always sometime to add. That's why I love Nexus.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> - Romo is a top 5 quarterback
- Aikman has every right to be in the Hall of Fame
- Witten is the greatest all around tight end of all time 
- Passing the ball at the end of Super Bowl 49 was the right call
- Winning the Super Bowl this year did nothing to hurt or help Mannings legacy
- Skip Bayless and Stephen A Smith aren't that bad, I feel like they over exaggerate for views but their discussions are some of the best on ESPN (they'll never be as bad as Jamele Hill)
- If people are going to discredit Emmitt Smith for having an amazing offensive line they should discredit Jerry Rice for having Montana and Young
- The early retirements of great players like Megatron and Beast Mode aren't going to have the impact on other retirement decisions that analysts and pundits would have you believe 

Non NFL just because 

- Even if they break the season wins record the 2015-2016 warriors are not the greatest team of all time, not even top 3
- MTSU over MSU is one of if not the greatest upsets in sports history
- People irrationally hate Syracuse University and Jim Boeheim. All I see on sports forums, 4chan and Reddit is that SU and JB are scumbags, pieces of shit, jokes etc etc with no arguments to back them up. They claim Boeheim is a scumbag due to the Fab Melo controversy and the Bernie Fine incident yet those same people will ride the cocks of Rick Petino and Joe Paterno and completely defend Petino and Paterno to the end. They claim Boeheim hasn't accomplished enough in his career and doesn't deserve to be considered one of the greatest coaches of all time but they still hold Tom Izzo to a ridiculously high standard. 
- Pete Rose has no right to ever be in the Hall of Fame </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the Warriors and Curry are phenomanal but wouldn't be able to handle not only Jordan's offensive skills but also his and pippens defensive skills. Add in Rodmans rebounding (which he had down to a science) and I don't see the Warriors winning a series. I also think that the more games they play against each other the better Jordan and the Bulls would be able to gameplan. 

10/10 series Bulls. 

As far as a single game goes I think it would be 7/10 Bulls. If Curry and Klay both go off and get hot quickly they could win, but they would also need to play an amazing game while the Bulls don't. 

It'd be a good game either way.  </TEXT>

That's not saying that the PC mods are quality, because they are. I just don't see the consoles having as much as a selection. 

EDIT: I could be wrong though, and I will eat my words if I am. But I haven't heard anything as far as modding for the console versions, how it's going to be installed and how they're going to be supported.  </TEXT>

I have two choices. 

I'd like to go through MGS1 as Vamp (the version from MGS4). He's one of my favorite characters in the series and I think it would be fun to go through Shadow Moses as a nigh immortal fast striking knife wizard. 

The other one I would like is to play as Gray Fox through MGS4. I would like to see him and Cyborg Raiden go all out against the Gekko and Vamp. Plus you would start out with Stealth call and I feel he would have a lot of interesting philosophical monologues. 

What do you guys think? What villains would you like to play as?  </TEXT>

the Covenant bug where you can't do the quest, which sucks because that was one of my favorites. 

Sturges won't talk to me at all. I finished the minutemen quest line and I have no idea why he won't talk to me. My character says "Sturges" and he just replies "Oh yeah?" 

Dogmeat disappeared from my game and I had to spawn him back in. He was in Sanctuary and I sent him to the Castle. After a few IRL hours I decided to swap Piper for him and I couldn't find him. So I slept for 24 hours in game and he stil wasn't there. So I did the player.moveto command and it crashed my game. Luckily he didn't have anything on him so it wasn't a big deal to spawn another one but it was annoying. 

I think it might be because of the mods I have but even then only having 3 bugs isn't too bad. Especially compared to Skyrim or NV or 3.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was googling for an answer to this question for about a half hour earlier and I couldn't find a definitive answer. I've been using an Xbox one controller with the dongle as a Gamepad for the past few months but today I sold my xbox one and controller for spare cash. I use a Gamepad 90% of the time when I play, it's just comfier for me. Anyway my question is, is it possible to use a Logitech mouse Bluetooth dongle to connect to other Bluetooth devices? I have a PS4 controller and a micro USB cord that is long enough to suffice but I would much rather use it wirelessly. Is that possible or do I need to get a PS4 specific dongle? 

The dongle in question is this one

It's for the Logitech M510.

If this won't work what do you guys recommend for Bluetooth dongles?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can totally understand that. I'm sure I'm not going to convince you to change your mind on the matter, all I want to do is have you look at it differently and apply the expectations you hold for Troy being in the hall to everybody else. 

Another way I guess you could look at it is, Troy is in the Hall because of his rings and being the face and voice of the most popular football franchise for ten years. He's not one of the best QBs all time, but he didn't have to be. 

I have to ask though, using your statistic based argument, who else do you believe shouldn't be in the hall? There's no way Aikman is the only one.

<TEXT> The problem I have with people saying Aikman shouldn't be in the Hall is the fact that they compare him to quarterbacks now. If you actually look at the 90s he was in the top ten for practically every passing statistic, on top of being the QB for a 3 time SB champion Cowboys team and playing in 16 playoff games. His statline for those 16 games:

11-5 320/502 CMP% 63.75 3,849 YDS 23-17 TD-INT 

Along with a career playoff passer rating of 88.3, his career playoff numbers are enough to be a good looking 16 game season in today's pass friendly league. 

The other thing is the obvious one, the way offenses were run was a lot different. Sure you had guys like Marino, Young, Elway, Favre and Montana putting up crazy stats, part of it is because they are all time greats, but the other part it because teams didn't know how to play against it due to the fact that not a lot of teams were constantly passing the ball. Instead of a handful or so teams in 2016 that primarily run the ball while the rest primarily pass the ball, it was a handful of so teams in the 90's that primarily passed as opposed to running. Aikman had pretty good stats for a team whose offense went through Emmitt Smith around 65% of the time. 

My belief is that the Hall of Fame is reserved for players that cannot be ignored when talking about the history of the NFL. Anybody can use the stats argument for almost half of the players in the Hall of Fame, for example:

Art Monk: Sure he played 16 years, but he was only All Pro twice AND isn't even in the top 10 in any WR statistic despite playing for such a long time. You can say he only got in because of his three Super Bowls. 

Lynn Swann: He retired with only 336 catches, 5,462 yards and 51 touchdowns. He's not even in the top 100 for any of his statistics let alone top 10. Oh wait, but he won a bunch of rings. 

Joe Namath: Didn't even retire with a winning record. Some would say he's only in the Hall because he was "Broadway Joe." 

For the record I don't actually believe any of the above players should not be in the hall. The point is, you can't tell the story of the NFL without Broadway Joe and the Jets winning the super bowl. You can't ignore Lynn "Literally Catches Everything" Swann and the Steelers dynasty. You can't ignore Art Monk, who was part of three Redskins super bowl winning teams that won with three different quarterbacks and it didn't matter who was throwing to him, he was going to put up numbers. You can't ignore the QB of the "Triplets," one of if not the most consistently dominant offense of the 90's. 

TL;DR  If you're going to use Aikmans stats against him as a Hall of Famer, do it to everyone else that played in a different era.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-03-06 09:36:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This could possibly be considered a spite post, but I recently got into an argument with my friend over how powerful Batman really is. Let's have five separate types of challenges:

The first challenge will consist of Batman having to defend Gotham City from the characters I post below, individually mind you, not all at once. And by defend I mean that he'll have all of his assets in Gotham to support him in the fight such as Nightwing for backup, the Batmobile and Alfred. He'll also have a week to prepare for the character to get to Gotham. 

The second is the same as above but Batman does not have time to prepare. 

The third challenge will consist of just one on one fights, the arena will be Central Park.

The fourth challenge is the same as above but Batman is bloodlusted. 

The fifth challenge is the same as above but both Batman and his opponent are bloodlusted. 

I don't know too much about Batman. The only version I really followed was Batman Beyond. But I've also played the Arkham games and have seen Batman Begins, Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises, so I guess for the gauntlet you can use either of those. 

Also if a fight is too unfair feel free to explain what he would have to do to make it 5/10. Again, I honestly don't know much about Batman so this will help me out a bit while also hopefully being a good discussion. 

Mind you, the friend in question thinks that Batman has the capabilities to defeat all of these characters.

<TEXT> The hunter, Bishop, is a very calm young man. He wants to do what is right but sometimes his own goals get in the way. He gave up on doing the right thing after the death of his lover. A wanderer, Bishop traveled the world in search of a purpose. He was a bodyguard for a nobleman and also a mercenary for quite some time, some would say he was a natural. After a job gone wrong that resulted in the death of a child, a price was placed on his head. The hunter became the hunted. He fled the region and eventually made his way to Yharnam where he knew that nobody would be looking for him. Shortly after his arrival he went to a popular clinic in Yharnam hoping that the stories he heard about the blood were true. After waking up with a newfound power and purpose, Bishop is at peace doing the one thing he knows best...hunting.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly if I had waited and seen the gameplay and how much the new dialogue system simplified the role playing aspects I would have borrowed it from a friend instead. It's what I did for Dark Souls 2 (which to me was disappointing). Again this is all hindsight talking, but if I had just seen the intro quest with the minutemen and starting off with power armor I would have been wary of purchasing it. It was at that point while playing that I was already losing interest. FO4 seemed (for lack of a better word) casualized. I think now I know how Elder Scrolls fans felt between Morrowing-Oblivion-Skyrim with how simple they had made everything. </TEXT>

Preordering it? Not a chance. I hadn't preordered a game since Colonial Marines until Fallout 4 came out and that was a mistake. I thought,"Fallout is one of my favorite game series ever, there's no way this preorder won't be worth it." It wasn't. I played through it once and haven't touched it since. Did I get my money's worth? I guess so. But I don't want to get burned again. I won't even risk it for DS3.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a HUGE Alien and Predator fan so my scores might be higher than most, I'm going to rank them by movie individually. But here we go:

Alien: A-
Aliens: A+
Alien 3: B-
Alien Resurrection: C

Overall: A

Predator: B+
Predator 2: B
Predators: B

Overall: B

I like the Predator flicks as action/popcorn/bro flicks. I enjoyed Predators more than most people I know, but I'm a sucker for these two franchises. Aliens is probably one of the best scifi movies ever made and Alien is a classic horror film. Alien 3 was a return to the roots of having just one Alien and while Resurrection was definitely the weakest of the series it has its moments.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I kind of want to start the offseason with some discussion on the veterans of the league. I'm sure the retiring of Lynch and Johson caught everyone off guard. Where do you guys have them on the all time list and would you consider either of them to be hall of famers? Feel free to include other players near the end of their careers as well. 

I personally think that Megatron should be in the hall. He holds the record for most yards in a season, game and was the most dominant receiver in the league for most of his career. 

I'm unsure about Lynch. If I could put him in I would simply just for having the greatest run by a player in NFL history, along with some of his accolades, but I can understand why some people wouldn't. 

I realize we had the Case for Canton series within the past year but there may have been some players that you feel should have been discussed that weren't. 

So, what do you guys think?

Is there an argument for Roger Federer? I hear his a lot. I'm more of a Djoker guy myself but I think the top two ever are Agassi and Federer and you can make an argument for either. 

And in my personal opinion KAJ is the GOAT over MJ, but that's just me. MJ has the titles and the media presence, but I feel like Kareem is better. But he also played in a less competitive era maybe? Idk, I'm not a huge basketball guy. 

What about NASCAR? The only two I can think of are Richard Petty and Dale Sr. Maybe Jimmy Johnson as well.

<TEXT> R1) Where exactly in the Mojave? If it's down south near Goodsrpings and Primm I can see it doing some damage due to the gangers and the civilians there. But once you go up north near McCarran and the Strip it'll be a bit tougher. And if the Deathclaw and alien fight once and it isn't over quickly I can see one of the two retreating. I'd like to imagine a Xeno-Deathclaw hybrid :o

R2) Hmm. I think it's pretty even. I'd give it 6/10 to the queen just because of her tail. If she can get a lethal strike with a tail she's got it. Death claws are smart but their usual method of attack is charging forward. 

R3) same a above 6/10 queen. 

BR) oh shit. I'd love to watch these unfold. I think replacing the Deathclaws with Xenos would be pretty devastating. The ultimate death bringing creature along with the creatures it could impregnate (Yao-Guai, super mutants, Nightcrawlers) would devastate both the east and west coast. I can see the Xenos being a bigger threat because of that and the fact they reproduce on a larger scale IMO 

As far as the Deathclaw goes in the alien universe:

Alien: I give it to the Deathclaw 8/10 times. IIRC the only weapon on board of the Nostromo is a flamethrower. That isn't gonna be enough. Their only hope is getting it out of the airlock, but I feel like it'll kill everyone before they can react. Or if you want to be specific, the Nostromo wins 10/10 times by leaving when they realize that Kane got eviscerated by a giant lizard. :p

Aliens: The way Hudson says,"Just another bug hunt." During the debriefing leads me to believe that the colonial marines are used to killing creatures. I think they were shaken up in aliens because they were stealthy. If you've ever played the fallout games you'd know that deathclaws aren't very stealthy. I feel like they'd be able to kill all of them with minimal to moderate casualties. They got tactical smart missiles, phase-plasma pulse rifles, RPGs, they got sonic electronic ball breakers! They got nukes, they got knives, sharp sticks... 8/10 Colonial Marines

Alien 3: They're fucked. The Deathclaw won't stop after each kill, it'll just keep killing. 9/10 DC

Alien Resurrection: This one is tricky. The aliens don't really become a factor until the break out, and they only break out because of the acid blood. Deathclaws don't have acid blood. The have razor sharp claws, but I don't think that the corporation would put them in cages that they can slash their way out of. If they can't get out of the cages it's 10/10 Resurrection. If they can I give the deathclaws a decent chance. 7/10. Only because they won't be as unified as the aliens and aren't as tactically adept. 

AvP: Predators stomp. Deathclaws are a much easier target to hit. 

AvP Requiem: US military stomps, I don't even think they'd have to glass the city of it were deathclaws. Plus having an elite predator hunt a bunch down helps too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This game was my GOTY for 2015. I really enjoyed the story even though that was a complaint I was reading about online. The combat was fun and micromanaging equipment is my shit, experimenting to find the best load out for each member of the party and then experimenting to use the best tactics and learning how to fight certain mobs, man I had a blast with this game. 

The only complaint I have is that the bosses weren't very challenging, specifically the final boss. It was disappointing that the dungeons leading up to most of the bosses were more difficult than the bosses themselves. 

I recommend this game to anybody looking for a new RPG to pump time into.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand that I'm probably posting too much but to be quite honest my only friend that watches this show is my father and I like discussing with people on this subreddit a lot more.

In all honesty I'd pick Aemon Targaryan to be the king. I feel like if he was on the throne rather than the Mad King Robert's Rebellion never would have happened. Unfortunately that means that a lot of the characters that we love probably wouldn't exist. 

Aemon is kind, wise and very observant. I think he would have been a great fit. 

Another character that I would like to see on the throne is Stannis Baratheon. He seems like he would be the best at Protecting the Realm. He understands the threat of the White Walkers and doesn't take any bullshit from anybody. 

Who would you guys like to see on the Iron Throne?

EDIT: I'm going all in on Stannis, considering that some characters probably wouldn't exist within the timeline of Aemon being the king.

You can also include the small council if you would like. My dream small council (implying that it is a time of peace and there wouldn't be any families trying to usurp the throne) would consist of:

Hand of the King: I'd probably go with Davos, as /u/rayluaza pointed out, Davos is intelligent and also has a commoner's perspective.

Master of War: I'd have to go with Tywin Lannister. The Lannister army is one of the best in the 7 kingdoms and he has been at the helm for over 30 years.

Master of Coin: Petyr Baelish. A self made man. Even though the crown was in debt while he was master of coin I feel like he would do a decent job, I wouldn't know who else could be Master of Coin, maybe Tyrion?

Master of Whisperers: Gotta go with Varys. He has little birds all around the known world and always knows what is going on. He's the man

Master of Laws: Ned Stark. Honorable, wise and just. "He who passes the sentence swings the sword." I couldn't think of anyone better. 

Master of Ships: Balon Greyjoy. Assuming that he would be willing. Being the Lord of the Iron Islands I would think that he would have plenty of knowhow considering Naval warfare.

Lord Commander of the Kingsguard: Gotta go with Ser Barristan. Well respected and has won the most single combats in history.

Grand Maester: Pycelle. Even though he's plenty sleazy, he serves the crown justly. Just as he had been doing before the show started.

<TEXT> It would've been cool if he was friendlier to Dany but the closer and closer they got to Westeros the more he started to try and get rid of her.

<TEXT> I personally would bring back Ser Barristan Selmy. I feel like show watchers got the short end of the stick for Ser Barristan because if I recall correctly he's still alive in the books. I was incredibly happy when he joined Dany and I feel like he didn't get to do much of anything. His death hit me hard as well, it seemed cruel that he gets killed by a bunch of nobles with daggers. I want to see more of his badassery and I feel that he could have been one of the best advisors for Dany. 

I know I picked a character from the show but feel free to pick someone from the books as well. I'm excited to see everyone else's opinion on the matter.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We all know about what happened to Theon and his transformation into Reek. His motivation for making his rash decisions were to finally earn the acceptance of his father. He wanted to live the Ironborn way by taking what he wanted, unfortunately it backfired.

Here we come to Ramsay Snow. While his father was fighting in the War of the Five Kings and presiding over Harrenhal, Ramsay was toying with Theon and eventually turned him into Reek. Eventually Ramsay earned the favor of his father and earned the name Bolton. 

What I find interesting is the contrast between the two men. We have Theon, the rightful heir to the Iron Islands and throughout his interactions with Ramsay he becomes completely disowned by his father (some would say he already was but I think at this point there is no going back as the only one in his family that cares for him is Yara) while Ramsay finally becomes appreciated by Lord Bolton. 

It just seems funny that they travel down the same path (trying to make their father proud). One succeeds and another fails. I'm not sure if that was on purpose or not but I've watched the whole series multiple times and finally noticed. 

On that note. Are there any other comparisons or contrasts between two characters that you might have noticed?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

* Country of purchase: USA

* Budget range: $700-$1000

* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): Portalble gaming

* Screen size preference: 13" is what I'm used to. I wouldn't have a problem with going up to 17" though. 

* OS preference (Windows/Mac/Linux): Windows

* Gaming requirements (list example games and desired fps/settings): I play CSGO, Diablo, Fallout (3,NV and 4), Skyrim, Witcher 3. I also want to use this to emulate too mostly consoles PS2 and earlier. 

* Other performance requirements (video editing, CAD, etc.): nothing else really. I'd like if to have a built in mike though. 

* Portability requirements (constantly carried, frequently moved, mostly stationary, etc.): the size or weight isn't too important. It's going to be transported every other day. At least once a week. 

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility): no bias here. Any brand works for me. 

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): again, as long as it works. 

**Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one or two)**

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight -vs- High performance: performance over everything. 

* Build quality -vs- Low price: low price

**List any critical features:**

I think I already mentioned but a built in cam/Mike are almost a must have. 

**Which features would you pay a premium for?** (eg. high resolution screen, great keyboard/touchpad/audio, low noise/heat): high res screen definitely. 

If I didn't post this correctly just let me know. Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow I feel like a dick because I never replied. Sorry man! And yeah, even though I believe that, I feel like its up to the lore/canon of The Last of Us universe. We really don't know how large the Fireflies actually are. We know that they're prevalent enough to cause pseudo-terrorist attacks in Boston, and there are pendants EVERYWHERE throughout the game. I feel like if the Fireflies are large enough to have a presence in most (if not all) quarantine zones and have a few more outposts other than the one in Utah (or wherever it is in the end of the game, hadn't had my coffee yet lol) I feel like they'd be able to get a lot accomplished. But considering that Marlene requests two freelancers (Joel and Tess) to transport Ellie it's easy to assume that isn't the case. </TEXT>

But I was going to school at the community college right next door to a juvenile detention center where a kid broke out. My friends and I were walking through the cross country trail smoking and we heard sirens go off and dogs barking (you can literally see the detention center from the trail, there's a barbed wire fence separating the jail yard from the trail) and we started freaking the fuck out. We put all of our weed away and started walking further away from the jail and my residence hall. About five minutes later I get a call from my uncle (higher up at the college) who was freaking out making sure I was alright. We go back to the residence hall about 15 minutes later to find out the kid tried to rob one of my other friends of his phone and my friend beat the dogs hit out of him. The kid ended up fleeing into downtown Syracuse and got caught a day or so later.  </TEXT>

We always disagree and do things our own way but there's always one thing that we come together on. And as far as keeping Ellie with the Fireflies I have to disagree. I think even if they did manage to find a cure it would be a lost cause because of how messed up the world is already. If you want you can join us over at 
/r/thelastofus for more in depth discussion! 

Almost forgot. As far as praise goes, this game definitely deserved all of it. The only thing I didn't like too much was the combat but even then it had its moments. Near perfect game IMO.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lmao it's all good man. I don't think it'll NEVER be broken. There's always a chance. But I think this record along with Emmitt Smiths career rushing yards record will never be broken (see my post) and Jerry Rices career receiving yards record (just on pure obscenity) simply because it take more than skill to break career records. If I'm sounding incoherent it's because I've been up for about 28 hours or so. So. Yeah. I should get off Reddit. 

EDIT: I listed running backs that I feel are the focal point of the offense. Charles and Peterson (Foster when he's healthy) are the only BIG names I could think of. Gurley might end up being the whole offense in Los Angeles, but it's only been one season so I want to wait a bit. I like what I've seen though. He's definitely going to be a good player.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah so I never ended up going to bed but basically the reason I think it'll never be broken is two things:

1) Running backs don't last very long. The average length of a running backs career is only 3.11 years. There's a lot of wear and tear involved in the position. Now I get that there are some running backs that have long steady careers such as Steven Jackson and Frank Gore that just make it over 10k yards (and then you have the superstars like LDT or AD that go above and beyond). LDT finished his career 5th in rushing (13,684) and AD is currently 17th (11,675). AD is 30 and is showing no signs of slowing down anytime soon, he seems like his body can take the punishment. Let's say he doesn't slow down. He had 1,485 yards this year and led the league. Even if he gets 1,485 yards every year until he hypothetically breaks the record he would need to keep up that pace or better for over four seasons. That is highly unlikely. However, in my opinion if anyone can do it its AD. 

2) Running backs aren't really the focal point of the offense anymore. I did a bit of research and found that the number of 1,000 yard rushers has fallen off since 2005, along with the season high:

2005: 16 1,000 yard rushers. Shaun Alexander led the league with a whopping 1,880. 

2010: 17 1,000 yard rushers. Arian Foster led the league with 1,616 yards. 

Now that doesn't seem too bad. It really isn't honestly, but when considering the 2005 season had three backs that out gained Fosters yards in 2010 it shows that there is either a drop off in use, talent or possibly even luck. 

But when you look at this season it becomes clear. 

2015: ONLY 7 1,000 yard rushers. Adrian Peterson led the league with 1,485 yards. Not only is 1,485 yards another drop off but losing ten 1,000 yard rushers in five years is crazy. 

Now in 2010 only Foster out gained ADs total from this past year, but in 2005 had five rushers that out gained him. 

The pure running back is on a decline, I don't think it's dying but I think it's stagnant for now.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bell isn't the focal point of his offense. 

Gurley literally just finished his rookie year, let's give him a bit before we think he breaks Barry's record. 

I really don't know who Adams is off the top of my head. 

I'm not even going to comment on Ingram. 

Johnson. Which Johnson? Chris is too old to handle the work load and I don't see David doing it either. 

I should have phrased my comment better. I meant to put Generational/Hall of Fame RB (AD, LDT, Barry, Sweetness, Faulk, or Smith) but decided not to because IIRC Demarco Murray came close to breaking the record in the 2014 season. I think he had 7 straight and he isn't even a top 5 running back in the league, he just so happened to fit perfectly with Dallas' gameplan last year and played way better than expected. He's definitely not a generational talent or top 3 back, if he was he wouldn't have laid an egg this year.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Emmitt Smiths career rushing yards record.

I'm getting ready to go to bed so I'll be back to explain why when I wake up in the morning. 

Edit: Yeah so I never ended up going to bed but basically the reason I think it'll never be broken is two things:

1) Running backs don't last very long. The average length of a running backs career is only 3.11 years. There's a lot of wear and tear involved in the position. Now I get that there are some running backs that have long steady careers such as Steven Jackson and Frank Gore that just make it over 10k yards (and then you have the superstars like LDT or AD that go above and beyond). LDT finished his career 5th in rushing (13,684) and AD is currently 17th (11,675). AD is 30 and is showing no signs of slowing down anytime soon, he seems like his body can take the punishment. Let's say he doesn't slow down. He had 1,485 yards this year and led the league. Even if he gets 1,485 yards every year until he hypothetically breaks the record he would need to keep up that pace or better for over four seasons. That is highly unlikely. However, in my opinion if anyone can do it its AD. 

2) Running backs aren't really the focal point of the offense anymore. I did a bit of research and found that the number of 1,000 yard rushers has fallen off since 2005, along with the season high:

<TEXT> Especially when you consider how running the ball isn't really the focal point of the offense anymore (yeah there's still AD, Foster and Charles), it's going to take IMO a combination of: a top 3 (possibly top 1) RB, a really good Oline and some luck.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I play madden 15 all the time and can give my two cents. I just drafted a WR in th 5th out of Harvard and he was an 83 OVR, highest rating for a WR out of everyone else drafted. 

Basically, when scouting, ONLY scout Intangibles and Physical. If a player has an A in one and an A or B in another, he's gonna be a superstar. If he has two Bs he's gonna be good. Has a B and a C he's going to be decent but could also be a wild card, I've drafted a B/C player and had him start as an 80 which is really good for a rookie. Two C's and your looking at a little work but not too much. And anything worse than that I don't even bother drafting. 

I don't have to worry about the cap and resigning guys as much as much because I can keep drafting guys to replace them. After his first year the 83 WR I drafted is already an 89. Evince Powers is his name. 

(I'm pretty sure it's all random in 15 though so the names don't matter)  </TEXT>

I have a few questions:

1) Do I have to take it right away? I plan on saving it for the National Championship game next Monday and I'm worried it won't be as potent.

2) Adding on to that, will the lemon juice affect the product in any way? As far as affecting the potency.

3) Can I mix LSA with other psychedelics? Or is it a waste of one or the other. (I was thinking of mixing it with DXM)

<TEXT> I've been doing a bit of research on here and on Erowid the past few days on LSA and Morning Glory seeds. People say the trip is incredible but the nausea is similar to vertigo or food poisoning. 

What do you recommend I take to keep that from happening? I have Omeprazole, TUMs, Pepto and a little bit of weed. 

Will these be enough to keep me from feeling like shit? 

Also, would LSA mix well with weed? How about opiates? 

I'm really eager to try these out, and input is appreciated! Thank you!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One that I've been hearing as of late is that Dez is overrated. "Oh, but Pamela, he's one of the highest paid receivers and he hasn't done jack this year." Okay. He fucked up his foot in the beginning of the season, came back before it was 100% healed and got the ball thrown to him by Brandon Weeden and Matt Cassel. Yeah, I realize he hasn't done great this season, but people are ignoring the fact that when he got paid he was leading the league in TDs since he started playing. "Oh, well touchdowns don't matter as much as yards." And to that I say fuck off. If you would rather have a guy get 1500 yards and 5 TDs over a guy getting 1000 yards and 15 TDs you can be my guest, I'll take the extra points any day of the week. It would make since if the passing attack was all that Dallas has, but ever since I've been a cowboys fan it seems like it's short passes and rushing to get down the field and passing to score the points. Sure, Dez isn't the best receiver in the league, but he's worth the money and easily one of the best playmakers. Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to go wait until April 28th.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not exactly sure. If GTAV gets low enough I'll probably pick it up, it'll be the third system I've bought it for but it'll be worth it I think. I'm just worried how it'll run on my computer. 

Other than that, maybe MGSV, anyone know if the port for that was decent? 

I kind of want more RPGs, if Scholar of the First Sin is cheap enough I'll probably get that too. Realistically I'll just keep playing Pillars of Eternity either way.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm staying away from this one until there's a price drop. It's really fun, don't get me wrong. But before everybody and their mother asks me why, here's my answer:

I don't like multiplayer anymore. I'm burnt out on it. Shit, that's all I've ever really played was MP shooters. I started with R6 Vegas actually. Then CoD and BF and then TF2 and then CSGO and I'm just done. I'm not confident I'd get my money's worth. I get frustrated easily and am always playing three or four games at once and I wouldn't have time to actually learn and get better...which would then lead to me getting more frustrated. Tis a vicious cycle.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you explore every area thoroughly and do as many side quests as you can you can get the gear early. My highest level character is only level 4. I literally just got to defiance bay. And as far as chants I prefer come soft winds, some thing else, come soft winds. I usually just have his chants set to AI though.

You can also swap the cape of deflection for a necklace with the max endurance boost, I've done that before and it's worked fine. I should let you know that I use him as a summoner, so by the time he gets a phantom or the skeletons off most of the heat is taken off of him.  </TEXT>

Best running gag was either Shi Tpa Town or Caitlyn Jenner, the whole ad thing was a bit annoying. 

Rating? Low tier. Probably not gonna watch some of these episodes again. 

I liked the continuity last year but now it's kind of meh. I really just didn't like the plot this year. 

Season 20? I'd like little to no continuity, but I don't see that happening.  </TEXT>

EDIT: I saw you want more damage, I'd hire a rogue if you're confident that your frontline can hold mobs back long enough. I have a rogue just for ranged weapons and it's working out pretty well.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let's see:

Pillars of Eternity: HOLY SHIT THIS GAME! It's the first cRPG I've ever played and it is already one of my favorite games ever. I bought it during the last steam sale when it was only $23 and I've already put in 85 hours (while working 50-60 hours a week). The combat is fun but very tough to get used to, the characters and the storyline are amazing and the side quests OH MY GOD the side quests are seemingly endless. I finished my first run at 75 hours and did about 20 side quests, my second play through is only 10 hours deep and I've found 7 other side quests in the first act alone that I never found before! I don't have many complaints, I know the game isn't perfect, but it's pretty close in my opinion. If you've had any thoughts of getting this game, DO IT! You won't regret it. And this is coming from a guy that really only plays Madden :p

Wolfenstein The New Order: This game is just badass. Idk why it took me so long to play it, it's been in my steam library for a few months. Last week I decided to boot it up and I've been having a blast. Just mindless nazi killing. It's a good blend of classic Wolfenstein and modern FPS. 

Forza 6: My first racing game since Gran Turismo 3, and I'm having fun. The graphics are really nice and the dynamic driver AI is very cool. Need to play more honestly. 

Borderlands Handsome Collection: I've only just started BL2 but it's uh, alright I guess. I think I'm just burnt out on Borderlands. And it just seems like they tried too hard? Maybe? I really don't know. It just isn't gripping me like the first one did. The gunplay and the mechanics are great and it's more challenging than the first one, but I feel like something is missing. 

I just picked up Final Fantasy Type-0 today and I'm eager to play that as well. Happy gaming all!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not extremely experienced, I've only gone through the game once and I'm still learning but I've been using Kana as a summoner for both of my playthroughs and its working pretty well. It doesn't seem like it works much in the beginning but when he gets the wurm summon it starts being helpful. Even the skeleton summon helps out because of the chance of distracting enemies and the damage they can do actually adds up. Once you get the ogre and drake summons its game over. If you're gonna be creating you're own I would advise in high constitution and dexterity so he can last long enough in fights to get all of his summons off quickly. Again, a more experienced player would probably help more but that's what I've found works. Good luck! It's a really fun dynamic. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Hello all, just had a quick question about buying jerseys. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-08 17:10:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Now, as you can see from my flair, my favorite team is the Cowboys, unfortunately I can't have two teams otherwise I would have it set to Cowboys/Raiders. For Christmas this year I am looking to get a jersey for my favorite defensive player of all time: Charles Woodson. Now, I also wanted to eventually get a jersey of one of my favorite Cowboys players, Darren Woodson. I figured it would be cool to represent both of these all time great safeties with one jersey. I've scoured google and other forums looking for a solution but cam away with nothing. Would anybody on r/NFL know if this is possible? If not it isn't too much of a problem. Thanks in advance everyone, and to the mods, if I violated any rules please let me know. 

EDIT: I'm looking to get a jersey similar to this one:

http://imgur.com/8yROVNZ

But replace Manning with Woodson and have it half Dallas half Oakland. 

I realize they aren't the same player , Bt they have the same last name and I thought it'd be pretty cool.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello all. I just have a few questions to ask you. And if there is a post on the sidebar or a popular post that can answer these for me It'd be greatly appreciated. 

This past weekend I ordered a starter kit of Kratom, I'll post the link if asked but I'm not sure if it'll help that much. 

First, a bit of a backstory. I first heard of Kratom while lurking on r/Drugs and started lurking here as well and I became interested. I'm an on and off user of Oxy and other painkillers and I want to try Kratom because I've read it gives the same effects and is safer. So enough about me. On to the questions. 

1) What should my dosages start as? I ask because I worry that if I start too low I wouldn't end up feeling anything and if I go to high I would end up having a bad time. Normally I would rail 2 oxy 10mgs a day if that gives any help as far as my recommended starter dose. 

2) What should I exactly be expecting from the buzz/high of Kratom. 

3) How should I go about doing it? I've read that some people just mix it with juice or even use a shaker bottle to mix it with other beverages. I dont really want to try and make tea off the bat because I fear my roommates would end up drinking some without expecting what would happen. 

That's about it really, if i broke any subreddit rules or could have gone deeeper into the sidebar posts just let me know and I'll delete this post.

Again, thanks for any and all advice. I'm eager to experience this product.  </TEXT>

And you can tell that between this season and last season that he has the love of his players. And the Bucs post game locker room videos are some of my favorites to watch. I'm trying to watch their games whenever I can, it seems like they've definitely progressed over last year. They're gonna be a fun team to watch for the rest of this season and the next few seasons to come.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My personal Pros and Cons:

Pros: 

It's fallout, my favorite games series. 
Weapon and armor modding. 
Companions and their quests are a lot better IMO 
Legendary enemies weapons and armor are cool
I really like the side quests. 

Neutral:

Base building, I don't use it so I have no opinion. 
The perk tree is hit or miss, it's okay. 
The new armor system is okay as well, just tough to get used to I guess. 

Cons:

Main story is abysmal. I struggled to really care about anybody in the Commonwealth. I sided with the Institute just because they seem like the most evil faction and my first character in a Fallout game is usually evil. 
Dialogue choices kind of suck. 
It's extremely hard to create an evil character, and there seems to be a lack of choice when it comes to the main story. Similar to FO3, I feel like it's too black and white. 

All in all its a great game, I'm level 41 with my main and I'm starting a second guy this weekend. It's a solid 7.5/10, can't wait for DLC. 

EDIT: replaced grey with black and white, got my phrases mixed up.

<TEXT> My courier and SS would probably get along. They both sided with the technological powerhouses in their respective games (House and Institute), they're both addicted to Chems, love sniping and travel with a red headed badass (Cass and Cait). I feel if they were going to fight however the Courier would crush the SS. He's way more versatile than the Survivor. My survivor sucks at close range combat and my couriers Arsenal prepares him for any and every situation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> AFC West would be dope IMO. 

QB: Rivers or Carr, I can't really decide, the Raiders are my second team but I'm hesitant to put Carr over Rivers just due to experience and the fact that I'm not sure what kind of year Rivers is having. I'd put Manning if he didn't decline so sharply this year. 

HB: Charles and CJ Anderson

WR: Cooper, DT, Sanders, Maclin

TE: Davis, Kelce, Gates

OL: Whoever would make up the best I guess, the only o lineman I know off the top of my head is Mathis

Then you'd have a combination of the Broncos and Chiefs front 7 along with Talib, Harris, and Sean Smith at CB and Ward, Berry and Nosdoom as the safeties. 

NFC East wouldn't be too bad I guess. 

QB: Romo, but Eli is playing pretty well too. 

HB: Murray/Morris/Sproles/Mathews

WR: Dez, Garon, OBJ, Desean Jackson, Cruz

TE: Witten, Ertz

OL: I could be a homer and just say the Dallas Oline but I think that the other teams have pretty good guys on their lines too. I think the line would definitely have Zach Martin and maybe Tyron and Frederick. (Again, don't want to be a homer) 

As far as defense goes I don't really know many defensive players on the rest of the teams. Fletcher Cox would definitely make it. Along with Maxwell, Prince and DRC. The NFC East team would be interesting to say the least. We could have Romo play the regular season and then Eli play throughout the playoffs lol. 

I'd like to see what other NFC East fans would choose for the defense, I think the offense is straightforward for the most part, but I'm not sure about the defense.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> College Town in Central New York

When college is in session:

Easiest- MDMA, Oxy and Xanax
Hardest- Honestly, weed is hard to find. Same with LSD and Shrooms. 

When college is not in session (basically summer):
Easiest- MDMA, Weed and Shrooms
Hardest- LSD

MDMA is the only thing I can find whenever I need it. I can NEVER find LSD. And the college kids dry out the town of weed when they're here, same with shrooms.  </TEXT>

Hindsight is 20/20 I guess, but like you said he's playing a lot better now.

<TEXT> Pretty sure everyone hates the Cowboys. I don't want to judge one team so I'll do all of them. 

Patriots - I love Brady, BB is an all time great, Edelman is the EdelMAN and Gronk is amazing. Patriots are cool in my book. 

Jets - I have a soft spot for the Jets. I want them to do well. They have great uniforms and loyal fans. 

Bills - Fuck 'em. I live in Central New York and half of my family is made up of Bills fans. They're insufferable. 

Dolphins - Meh. 

Colts - They're decent. Luck is cool I guess. 

Texans - Watt is phenomanal. Wish they didn't fall off so soon. Looking forward to them getting good again. 

Titans - McNair is one of my all time favorites. Mariota looks promising. They're alright. 

Jaguars - I have a soft spot for them. My early memories of Madden are playing as them when they had Marcus Stroud, Leftwich and Taylor/Jones-Drew. I hope they get to the top of the AFC with Bortles soon. 

Steelers - I like Big Ben. Harrison is one of my favorite defensive players ever. The Bus is great too, was really happy to see him get in the Hall. I don't care what anyone says he deserves it. 

Bengals - My optometrist is a Bengals fan, so I see them in a good light. 

Ravens - Fuck yeah. That's all. 

Browns - I want them to do well. 

Chiefs - Another soft spot team. I loved Holmes, and Derrick Thomas is an all time great. Sucks about Charles. Most electrifying player in the game imo. Hope he gets better and kicks ass next year!

Raiders - If I wasn't already a Dallas fan I'd be a Raiders fan. The only jersey I have that isn't a Cowboys jersey is a Raiders Woodson jersey. Love them 3

Broncos - Fuck 'em. 

Saints - Meh. I like Brees. 

Falcons - Fuck 'em. My cousin is a Falcons fan and he's a prick when it comes to football, I used to like them but he ruined it for me. 

Buccaneers - Decent. 

Panthers - I love Cam. 

Seahawks - Meh. 

49ers - Meh. 

Rams - Meh. 

Cardinals - Like them a lot. Love Fitzy and Palmer. 

Bears - The Bears and the Cubs Chicago sports team I don't mind. Fuck the Bulls/WSox/Blackhawks though. 

Packers - Like them. Favre is magical and Rodgers is the best QB in the league. Nothing negative about them really. 

Lions - Fuck 'em. I understand the call against last postseason was awful but I received threats and that's not cool.

Vikings - I like them. 

Giants - My grandfather is a Giants fan so I can't hate them too much. They're fun to watch and DALvNYG are my favorite divisional games to watch. 

Redskins - Eh. 

Eagles - Fuck 'em.

<TEXT> I was actually just talking to my friend about this. The way penalties are programmed into this game are asinine. Basically, the computer only recognizes and calls penalties if it "meant" for the penalties to happen or if a player triggers them. So if it's a computer running into your receiver but there isn't a specific animation there won't be a call. But say you were playing a CB and pressed the button to tackle prematurely, it'll "trigger" the animation and the penalty will be called. It's the same way with challenges. Almost all of the questionable calls in the game are calls the computer makes on purpose. It'll purposefully call a receiver out of bounds on an obvious catch or call him in bounds on an obvious no catch to see if the player will challenge it. It's pretty stupid. There might be someone else that can explain it better but that's my take on it. It blows.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Self explanatory. Your favorite character vs the fallout games with some stipulations. 

Fallout 3 - Your character starts the game captured by super mutants and has to escape. He or she has the choice to support the Brotherhood or the Enclave. Who do think they'd support and how would they do? If you think they would stay rogue would they succeed in taking over the Capital Wasteland? 

Fallout New Vegas - Your character arrives in the Mojave Outpost and wishes to go to New Vegas. If he or she makes it they are encountered by House, Benny, Caesars ambassador and the NCR ambassador. Who do they join and do they succeed in the battle of Hoover Dam?

DLC is optional for both games.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For New Vegas I would personally choose Vulpes from Caesar's Legion. I main a stealth character and he seems like a stealth master considering he runs the frumentarii. 

For Fallout 3 I would choose Harkness. I think it'd be cool if he would join me after I figured out his past. In lore it probably wouldn't work since he's the head of security but I think it'd be really fun. 

So yeah, who would you have as a companion of you could? And it can be any game, I chose 3 and NV because those are the only two I have enough knowledge about.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hope I don't get judged for this. But I've been playing WWE 2k15 Universe Mode and I'm having a blast. It's the first WWE game I've played since Smackdown vs RAW 2007. 

Basically, Universe mode puts you in the driver seat. You control every aspect of the WWE product. You can create tag teams, different shows, customize which belts wrestlers fight for and can create rivalries that you can play. It's everything I've ever wanted in a WWE game. 

You want Hulk Hogan and the Rock to form a tag team and fight Undertaker and Kane in a steel cage? You can do it. 

You want John Cena to become a bad guy and join the Authority with Randy Orton? Interrupting matches for up and coming stars and taking them out before they can fight? You can do it. 

Those are only two possible storylines, and they're almost endless. You can pick from templates or create them manually and it's just so fun. I actually spent last night creating rivalries for the Royal Rumble and watched the AI duke it out. 

So yeah, I've honestly felt like a kid again this game made me a WWE fan again and I couldn't tell you how excited I was to watch RAW this week and see my childhood hero again for the first time in years (Kane). I don't remember why I stopped watching WWE so many years ago but it's all better now because I'm back.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Before I start I'm letting you know that I'm enjoying the beta a lot. 

The main differences I've drawn up are really just how casual (for lack of a better term, I hate using this word) they made it. To me it seems like it has the depth of a free to play game. Regenerating ammo and grenades, only one blaster, regenerating health, long TTK and no voice chat in game are the negatives. I can look past the lack of classes and the power up tokens and stuff like that because the new system (while not as great) still works pretty well and I kind of enjoy it. The spawns are a bit wonky at times though. 

That's not to say I don't miss classes, playing with friends and having to talk and decide who is gonna be what class and which command posts we're gonna go after was one of my favorite things. Rolling up as a squad of droideka while we have a sniper cover us from long distance and other tactical stuff like that. It just seems that the only gunplay is with the basic blaster and to me that leaves more to be desired. 

However, despite all that I'm having fun, and this is only the beta so my opinion doesn't reflect the whole game. 

EDIT: By one blaster I mean you don't get a secondary, I know there are multiple blasters.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just a quick question. Is default weapon/gadgets for Corvo just the stuff he starts with? If so that's a bit of a disadvantage, but not too much. That only leaves him with a flintlock pistol, his crossbow, sword and level one blink. While the spy would have stock weapons: his revolver, knife, cloak and disguise (the Sapper is moot imo). 

Round 1 - I give to Corvo 8/10. I doubt the spy would be able to get behind Corvo without him knowing. And the spys attack speed with the knife is slower than Corvos with his sword so mindlessly stabbing hoping for a backstab wouldn't work. Corvo can take multiple slashes with a sword in his armor so I don't think a knife would do much (unless it was a backstab). The revolver is the difference maker, but even then Corvo can blink-instant kill between shots. I just don't think the spy is quick enough to react. The only chance I give to the spy is if he can cloak and manage to sneak up on Corvo, that's a big IF though. Corvo was the personal bodyguard of the Empress and I assume that means he's trained to be good at defending against surprise attacks. The spy could also disguise as one of Corvos allies, or as Emily or even the Empress to throw him off, that could probably work. But I still give the edge to Corvo. 

Round 2 - Corvo 10/10. The element of surprise is all that the spy has. If Corvo is expecting him to disguise as an ally or cloak then that element is completely wiped away. I don't see the spy taking this round at all but I'm definitely open to discuss it. 

Round 3 - This one is a bit tricky. If by better you mean smoothly? I'd give it to the spy. It'd be a simple stab in the back. But if there is a lot of opposition I'd give it to Corvo. I'd honestly say they're even here but I really don't know what you mean by "better." 

Bonus: This round is closer but I give it to Corvo 6/10. If the spy is fast enough to dead ringer and backstab Corvo he takes it, but if Corvo "kills" him and then immediately blinks away or gets further than the spy can reach (I'm only assuming this because in my opinion it would make sense for a wanted man to immediately flee the scene of a murder) and his cloak dissapates which Corvo can then react to I think Corvo takes it. 

I think one on one Corvo takes it, the spy isn't really built for that. He's built for the element of surprise and that seems like something Corvo is prepared for (if you ignore the beginning scene, considering there was literally nothing he could do since he was suspended in mid air). But I feel if you put the spy in Corvos shoes for Dishonored he would kick ass. The Sapper would be perfect for the arc pylons, watch towers and walls of light and the cloak is better than anything Corvo has in his Arsenal. The six shot revolver would also be immensely helpful because the max that Corvos goes up to is 4 iirc. Could post though. Dishonored is one of my favorite games and I also adore TF2.  </TEXT>

FB - I don't think there have been any dominant fullbacks since Lorenzo Neal. 
WR - Reggie Wayne, hopefully Steve Smith. Possibly Andre Johnson, Fitz. Boldin maybe? Idk. There's a log jam but I'm just rattling off names. Megatron definitely gets in. 
TE - Gates and Witten are locks without a doubt. Gronk is in if he keeps up this level of play and stays healthy (fingers crossed) 
OL - Thomas definitely. Can't think of others of the top of my head. Peters? 
DL - Jared Allen should get in, I'd love Wilfork to get in but the Voters don't like nose tackles. Watt probably gets in (same rules as Gronk though, keep up level of play and stay healthy) 
LB - Ware is a lock, Peppers should also get in. 
DB - I consider Revis a lock, his twilight years will definitely influence the decision though. Woodson is a lock. 
K - Not sure, if any one currently gets in it should be Vinatieri. Leading scorer for two franchises and won Super Bowls with his leg.
P - I don't see one getting in, Ray Guy just got in and he revolutionized the whole position. 

To me the Hall of Fame is made up of players that either A) you can't tell the story of the NFL without and/or B) have the stats and accolades that prove they are one of the best to ever play their position. People may be mad that I have AP but his story of tearing his ACL and then coming back to rush for over 2000 yards and win MVP is like something out of a movie. The same rule applies to Vinatieri with his clutch playoff kicks, the history of not only the Patriots but the NFL would be completely different if it weren't for him.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) I never threw parties, so my dad stomps this round. He's told me some crazy stories. 

2) I take this one 9/10. My dad is the guest that brings his own alcohol, drinks all of it and then passes out all within the first few hours. If he isn't doing that, he's usually talking to the same people the entire night. I'm usually one of the last ones to pass out, bring alcohol and cigarettes for more than just myself, and usually have everybody laughing. 

If my dad and I were going after the same girl? Hmm. If we met her that night, my dad takes it. If I knew her previously I take it.  </TEXT>

Factor in the fact that they're bloodlusted and boom. A few hundred pigeons in each eye, once the eyes are pecked out they probably have a few dozen or so that can stay in his eye sockets and keep pecking. There could be a few go in his ears and a bunch of others to distract him. I honestly give it to the pigeons 7/10 times, maybe more. Think about it like one human versus 1000 bloodlusted horseflies, it's winnable but it'd be a test of endurance.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Your favorite character vs the Resident Evil series </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-04 02:09:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Simple, your favorite character has to go through the Resident Evil series, there will be three different situations:

The first one, normal. Your character simply replaces the playable character of the game and gets their standard gear. 

The second one, your favorite character replaces the playable character of the game but only gets the gear that the PC would get. 

The third one, your favorite character replaces the PC and gets their standard gear BUT the main antagonist is replaced by your second favorite character. 

Round 1: Resident Evil 1. Your character replaces either Chris or Jill (you can pick) and must finish the story. 

Round 2: Resident Evil 2. Your character replaces Leon and must finish the story. 

Round 3: Resident Evil 3. Your character replaces Jill and rather than Jill getting sick at the clock tower (or whenever it happens, my memory fails me) it happens to Carlos, can your character save him and escape Raccoon City?

Round 4: Resident Evil 4. Your character replaces Leon and must rescue Ashley and kill Saddler. 

Round 5: Resident Evil 5. Your character replaces Chris BUT he/she does not get Sheva Alomar, can they destroy the Uroboros virus and kill Wesker? (Boulder punching required) 

BONUS Your favorite character replaces the antagonist of all the games above, can the resident evil characters survive?

<TITLE> Hi /r/squaredcircle, I'm trying to get back into watching WWE after not watching it the past few years, is there anyone that can give me a summary of what I've missed? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-22 10:04:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Title is the main point, and if I should post this somewhere else please let me know but I read the sidebar and since this is related to wrestling I figured it would be okay. 

Basically, I watched wrestling religiously when I was younger. HBK and Edge were my heroes, but once they retired I stopped really keeping up with it. Really the only thing I know is that Lesnar broke the streak. I watched Night Of Champions the other night, it was the first event I've watched in full since Mania 26. I missed RAW last night and plan to watch it today, I want to get back into WWE but I have a few questions to ask:

Who is Seth Rollins? Is he the newest big name in WWE? 

What's up with those dudes with the trombone? 

Are there any wrestlers that were popular back in 2010 that have since retired? If so, who? 

Who are some of the up and coming stars I should be looking out for? 

And the last one, what feuds/rivalries have surfaced the past few years that I should know about? 

This might seem like a troll post but it really isn't, and I know I could have googled this stuff but I was hoping to get the questions answered here by fans, and maybe have a little discussion as well. 

Anyway that's it, and mods if this type of post isn't allowed let me know please. Thanks everyone! 

And sorry if the formatting is bad, typed this up on my phone.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd like to see something along the lines of Spec Ops: The Line but with horror. For those that haven't played, SO:TL was a third person shooter that was heavily praised for its intense story. Throughout all of the traumatic events that happen, the main characters go from your run of the mill soldiers to shellshocked killers due to the post traumatic stress. I'd like to see a horror game do something like that, wherein the game starts out as a simple horror game but as it goes on and your character gets exposed to more horror he/she goes more and more insane. Sort of like the sanity meter in Eternal Darkness or Amnesia without the ability to gain sanity back. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm assuming you're talking about current players and not targeted because as /u/DaZerg said the drafts are random now. I may be a homer but when I start a non-Dallas franchise I always trade a few picks to the Cowboys (usually a second and two thirds) for Demarcus Lawrence and Randy Gregory. Gregory has really good development (went from 79 - 89 in one season) and Lawrence has decent block shedding and good power moves (88 IIRC) I also got Lawrence to go from a 77 - 91 after two seasons. As far as offensive players go Jimmy Garappolo (QB for the Pats) has a decent arm. With running backs you can't go wrong with Turbin or Michael (Seattle) Joseph Randle (Dallas) or Carlos Hyde (49ers). I can't think of any wide receivers right now but I'll update it when I do. Gavin Escobar (Dallas) is a decent receiver though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As in lockboxes? We weren't allowed to have them. If an RA or campus safety saw a lockbox or safe in our room they'd confiscate it under suspicion. Happened to my friend Jordan when he got in trouble. Long story short they found a box cutter in his room (he's a stock boy for a store) and confiscated a safe that he kept his grinder, bowl and rolling papers in. I thought I hid my stuff well enough, I took old socks and put them in the pockets of dirty clothes. I think it's worth mentioning that Mario was my roommate because he was banned from the other residence halls and we were constantly bothered by our RAs because of his past.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I went to school in Syacuse New York last year for two semesters. Dropped out due to poor grades, stress and anxiety. The latter two were brought upon by my roommate my second semester, we'll call him Mario. 

This first two paragraphs are backstory so you can skip those if you want. 

My first semester was great. I lived in a triple dorm with my best friend (that we'll call Jim) and then another kid that we knew from playing tennis in high school (we'll call him Rick). The whole first semester consisted of going to frat parties and playing madden and just having a great time, I finished my first semester with a 2.9, not great but not bad. At the end of the semester Jim and his girlfriend broke up so he dropped out due to the depression and he also didn't do very well on account of the frat parties. For the first month of the second semester it was just me and Rick hanging out. Going to parties, playing tennis and just having a good time like normal, until Mario came along. Now Mario, he was a character. He was a gangbanger from the east coast, covered in tattoos, wrote rap songs (that were awful) and was friends with other gangbangers on campus. (If you hadn't guessed I didn't go to SU, it was a community college). It started out fine. He was respectful of our routine, played video games with us and was a cool guy. We actually wrote a few songs with him singing/rapping over me playing guitar chords and played at open mics and at parties. He was becoming a good friend. Then, something clicked, he knew that we were scared to piss him off or disagree due to the fact that he was extremely aggressive and his posse was intimidating. 

One day I came back after my classes and saw the entire room rearranged, He texted me earlier in the day and told me Rick was okay with it (2/3 people in the room agreed so I didn't argue even though I was pissed). So whatever. Then Rick  comes back and same thing, he didn't bother to argue. So Mario leaves and we start bitching at each other, we had a good setup. And the way the room wa smoked around basically made it so my desk was cramped between my bed and Marios bed so I had no room. Apparently, Mario told Rick I was okay and he told me that Rick was okay with it. He fucked us over, and it got worse from there:

- My video games started disappearing, I'm assuming he stole them. GTA V, FIFA 15 and Mortal Kombat X. 
- He stole money from my wallet and also smoked my weed and cigarettes when I wasn't in the room, I know this because Rick told me. And I started hiding it and it would still end up missing (should've his it better) 
- Multiple times he tried to break into my computer to "play NBA 2k" even though he has it for Xbone 
- He would steal food, my grandmother made me brownies and I came back from a party to eat them and the box was empty on his desk
- He would bring his posse over when I would have friends or a girl over and kick us out. He would basically bully them until they left. 
- I let him borrow my Mac so he could type a paper because his laptop broke, he returned it and my wallpaper was changed and there were a bunch of programs that he installed onto it
- He stole PS3 controllers from me and gave them to his friends. I had six when I went to school and left with two. I went to his friends apartment to buy weed and found one of my controllers on his coffee table (i carved my name on the back of it) 
- He stole phone chargers from me, I was buying a new charger every month until I decided enough was enough and only charged my phone in my other friends room.
- He used my ecig without my permission and was going through my juice like a madman, a 15ml bottle of juice would normally last me two weeks and when he started using it i was running out within days 
- I confronted him about stuff that was missing and he got in my face and started screaming at me, telling me that I'm disrespecting him and to back the fuck off, when I threatened to report him to campus police because of it he threatened to have his friends jump me, and actually had some of them follow me around when I would go on walks or go to class. I was terrified. 

It might seem petty or immature to blame him for the reason to drop out but he really was. I have OCPD, and he would fuck my routines up and destroy the room and it got to the point that I would go days without going in due to the fact that I couldn't be comfortable there. Your room is supposed to be somewhere you feel safe, and I would've rather been on the Gaza Strip than be there. I had to go to counseling just to be able to go near the school and see my friends in Syracuse, I'm alright now, but I'm never stepping foot in that building again. In hindsight i should have had more of a backbone rather than be a doormat, but I prefer to avoid confrontation, I wish I didn't do that. But it was a learning experience. Don't be too trusting.  </TEXT>

My top five:

<TEXT> It really is the only gripe I have with UE. Even the gnasher stuff doesn't bother me as much (not saying it's not annoying, but I don't hate it as much as  a lot of other players I talk to). I lost count of how many times I've matched up in social playlists in UE with my friends and we get stomped by players that are a lot better than us. One of my friends barely plays anymore because of it. I don't dislike it that much, I still have fun, bud I'd really like to see a good ranking system.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In a Tae Kwon Do tournament when I was 15 I got knocked the fuck out by the guy I was sparring. The video went all around the school and one of the upperclassmen sent it to Daniel Tosh and it was on his Facebook page for a while. I asked the guy to take the original video down (it was 3 and a half minutes long and showed the second hit and a bunch of the spectators freaking out) and he put up just the first minute (which shows the first kick to the head. Ended up with a concusion and having to go to counseling because of the bullying. Jokes on them though because I still won. Guy got DQ'd. People also ignore the fact that him and I became good friends afterward. The only bad part about that is because it was my fourth concussion I had to stop playing contact sports. 8/10 would do it again for $100.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think I may have posted this before but I had also written an essay on it my freshman year of college. 

2007, Bills vs Cowboys. I was 11. First NFL game. 

Romo and the offense were playing like shit, he threw five picks and there was just no chemistry. We got that onside kick near the end and as time winded down we sent in Nick Folk to win the game. He kicks a 56 yarder, his career best and just barely makes it. We freaked the fuck out. Then we find out that the Bills iced him and we were deflated instantly. Then he lines up to kick it again, The Ralph was insanely loud. He kicks it and it goes perfectly down the middle. WE ERUPTED! From that moment on I was a die hard Dallas fan.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> You can pick one retired NFL player to play for your team this season in their prime form. The catch is that they can't have ever played for your team. Who do you pick? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Title should be self explanatory. Basically you can pick any currently retired NFL player to play for you for this season (including postseason) and they will be in their prime. But they can't have ever suited up for your team. For example:

Cowboys fans can't choose Emmitt Smith, neither can Cardinals fans. 
Ravens fans can't choose Ed Reed, neither can the Texans or Jets. 

So anyway my choice would probably be Barry Sanders. #20 behind our current Oline would be unstoppable. Who would you guys choose?  </TEXT>

I was so unbelievably hyped for this game. Aliens is my favorite franchise ever along with my dads favorite. Him and I split the preorder cost and even got the special edition and the season pass. We went to the midnight release together and everything. We got home after getting the game...loaded it up...and were immediately disappointed. The first mission was cool, when you first land on LV426. But as soon as you started fighting other humans him and I realized it was a lost cause. I hadn't preordered a game since up until Fallout 4 was announced. But A:CM ruined my dreams. Luckily Alien: Isolation was awesome as hell.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to be a huge stoner starting at 15. I'm 19 now and have been sober since May 10th of this year. There were a lot of reasons I quit. I was spending a lot of money on it, I was doing horrible at college and the increased paranoia and anxiety started to control my life. I don't believe that marijuana is a gateway drug, it was for me but not for the rest of my stoner pals and other ents that I know. I went from weed to painkillers to coke and then combinations of all of three of them. I quit those three and focused on cigarettes, and I quit smoking those last Monday. As far as why I don't smoke weed anymore? I don't enjoy being high anymore. It brings back all the bad memories and panic attacks and it just isn't worth it. Do I miss it? I guess so. But that's not who I am anymore.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like that's been happening to me a lot. I've noticed it my whole life really. Whenever I have a goal in mind I always strive to achieve it and I always seem to fall just short. I just feel like whenever there is something nice that happens to me or is about to happen something swoops in and makes it unreachable again. It's almost as if life or God or even my mind is playing tricks on me. Like, imagine happiness as a download bar, and every time the bar gets to 99% it shoots all the back down to 20%. Then you work tirelessly to get back up to that 99% only for it to jump down to 50%. That's just how I've been feeling about things. This is my first post and I'm not sure if I'm breaking any rules with it, I looked at other posts and the sidebar and I think I'm alright. But if I'm messing up I'll gladly fix it. Anyway, thanks for reading this if you did. I know it was probably weird but that's the only way I can describe what I'm feeling.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [REQUEST] Killing Floor 2 PC </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-13 03:16:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello /r/GiftofGames, I'm here to ask for Killing Floor 2. My name is Jake and I am a college student living in Syracuse, New York. I want Killing Floor 2 because Killing Floor 1 is one of my favorite games of all time and I had recently played KF2 at my cousin's house. I ask for your help because I have just finished my second semester of college. I would be purchasing this game myself, but the summer job that I was given has been withdrawn due to the deterioration of my mental health. Throughout this past semester I had dealt with the death of my grandfather, my best friend and roommate dropping out of school and working two hours away from me and also the divorce of my aunt and uncle, two people that practically raised me. This Monday I will be going to Liverpool for a psychological evaluation and the money I have to pay for the ride to the Therapists office will be enough to dry the well for the next few weeks (or even greater if I end up having something that requires a medication). 

Killing Floor 1 is in my top five video games. It is actually the reason I spent the money on a gaming PC two years ago. The gunplay, the intensity and the fun with friends made it almost addicting. I never got suck of picking it up and playing 10 rounds on Manor. And the frantic firefights never ceased to surprise me. I lov everything about the game. From the soundtrack to the characters and weapons. The maps and monsters are some of my favorite in a video game as well. 

As I stated earlier, I played a few matches of Killing Floor 2 last weekend at my cousins house. It was somehow better than I had hoped it would be. The new reload animations are fantastic and the revolutionized store and overall interface of the game make it feel new but not different from its predecessor. I really want this game so I can play with my cousins and other Steam friends as they have all moved on from KF1. One other thing I admire is that it really helps me unwind after a long day. Blasting away endless waves of grotesque creatures is like Chicken Soup for the Soul. 

In short, I'm hoping one of you will read this and help a broke college that has been going through a lot of hard times his past few months. If you do I will be eternally grateful, and promise to return the favor once I get back on my feet. Thank you for reading. If I messed up any formatting or forgot anything please let me know, as this is my first time posting on this subreddit.

<TITLE> Most powerful gaming laptop available for $1500 (US) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-20 10:29:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey all, I'm looking for the most powerful gaming laptop available within my budget of $1500. 

I have a Desktop currently but I want to be able to play the games that I play on my desktop when I travel and also for LAN parties. 

The only thing I really care about is the screen size, 17 inches is preferred but I'm open to any and all suggestions. 

I'm going to mainly be playing Counter Strike GO, Civilization 5, Skyrim and other games I dabble in are H1Z1, DayZ, Shadow of Mordor, and Diablo 3. 

I also want at least 8 GB RAM but 16 would also be nice if I decide to stream with it. 

I'm going to have $1500 to spend and I'm looking to spend all $1500.

<TITLE> Suggestions for a person new to horror films. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-18 04:56:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a friend and she is nervous about anything horror, so I was wondering what are some movies to watch with someone that hasn't ever watched a horror movie before, but also one that isn't too scary. A stepping stone if you will. I want to introduce her to horror movies because it's another way for us to spend time together. 

I had two movies in mind, tell me what you think (open to any and all criticism/ideas)

- Godsend, one of the first horror movies I ever watched. Maybe not so much horror as it is a thriller but there are quite a few jump scares, not too graphic from what I remember. 

- Saw, I know not a lot of people are fans of torture porn but I feel this one is a classic. The suspense is constant and the atmosphere is one of my personal favorites. 

Again, I'm asking for your help so any and all ideas are welcome. Thanks!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I am planning on building a new computer for Christmas. My dad has a friend that builds computers for a living and he sent me a build, but then I had one of my friends that builds computers for a living and he sent me one. I want to go with my friends because it seems to have a better graphics card and it is cheaper. Do you think you guys could help me decide which one is the better deal?

My Friends: http://pcpartpicker.com/p/2hyl8
My Dad's Friends: http://imgur.com/ALOciTr

List of games I'm planning on playing:

* Natural Selection 2 
* Killing Floor
* Dishonored
* Left 4 Dead 2
* Counter Strike: Global Offensive
* Starcraft 2
* Red Orchestra 2
* Amnesia: Machine for Pigs
* Amnesia: The Dark Descent
* Sanctum 2
* Orcs Must Die 2
* Farcry 3
* Skyrim
* Battlefield 4
* Titanfall (not released)

The most demanding games are going to probably Natural Selection and Battlefield 4. 


Edit 1: I realize SSDs are amazing, but I don't really want to pay $130 for one, because money is tight as it is. and 16GB RAM isn't really necessary is it?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey r/teenagers, I'm in need of advice from people that I can (hopefully) relate to. A very good friend of mine is a really big party person. The thing is, she wasn't always like this. She was  sober for the past 6 months up until her most recent boyfriend broke up with her, since then (a little under a month ago) her life has been about the next beer in her hand. but right now, even as I'm typing this she's at her third house party in a row. I was talking to her this morning about her drinking, and she told me that she wants to stop, but can't. I'm hanging out with her Tuesday all day and also all day Friday. Basically, what I'm asking is if any of you have ever been in this situation? What are the best things I could do to help her?

Tl;Dr Friend is drinking her problems away, want to help, what do?

I'm a guy for the record, if that helps at all   </TEXT>

<TEXT> She didn't die or anything. She was sick from school for a while and today was the first time I saw or heard from her in over a week. So naturally, I see her in school, give her a hug and tell her that I missed her, I knew something was wrong and should have stopped there. But I didn't. Because I'm stupid. The school day ends and I get home. She posts a picture on instagram and I like/comment on it. She doesn't acknowledge my comment but acknowledges everyone elses...hmmm...about 15 minutes ago, I'm sitting on my couch and got a message from her on Facebook that basically said,"You creep me out. The touching isn't cute or funny anymore, it's really disturbing. I really don't want to be your friend anymore." And that was that. Not only do I still have goosebumps, but I'm not even upset, I'm just...numb...anything you guys can do to help cheer me up?

Note: I took this girl to prom, spent loads of money on her, and I visited her in the hospital. And honestly, I don't want to try and fix this. I just want to feel...better.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My cousin and one of our friends both have Macs and can't stop saying good things about them. Today I went to the Apple website and picked out what I want my MacBook to come with, here's what I have so far. 

13-Inch MacBook Pro w/ OSX Mountain Lion 
Retina Display
2.5 GHz
Dual Core i5
128 GB
USB Superdrive
Backlit Keyboard
Pages
Numbers
Keynote
Apple TV
Thunderbolt Cable [2.0 m] 

the final cost is about $1900, money isn't that big of an issue as of late, but since this is my first Mac, I can honestly say that I do not know what to expect.

EDIT: I'm planning on using my MacBook for video and audio editing, as well as school work. And of course miscellaneous internet browsing. I'm not too worried about gaming on my Mac, I have a Playstation 3 for a reason.

EDIT 2.0 : Thanks for the help guys!  </TEXT>
