<TEXT> BPD and PTSD are both bitches, I hate it so much.  
People shouting at me and loud noises is, I shut down or get a bit freaked out. Other triggers are people touching me, or seeing someone that has done something to me.  
They are aware of mine, but not how bad they are, and have said I need to control my temper. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a lot more to the day then this, but this was a bit stupid.  
End of lesson, everyone was left apart from Jamie, Elisha, Becky and Dallas. I was sorta just there, but I heard Jamie say he'd rather be Michael Jackson. Went up to him and said he's a pedophile.  
The teacher said they was no proof, so I ended up saying that he was, just because there was no proof doesn't mean he didn't do it.   
She repeated it again. I started raising my voice saying he did do it. She said it, yet again. 
And that's when I ended up shouting that rapists and pedophiles always get away with it and ended up storming out.    
Dallas followed me and said I'm gonna be ok. She offered me some more of a fag, as I had a couple tokes even though I don't smoke earlier and it calmed me down as I was very pissed off and couldn't calm down.  
This time Furnay wouldn't let me, and sent me to lesson, which just made me very paranoid. 
My PTSD is very bad, nightmares, hypervilligence, paranoia, anger, eating problems, depressed ect. and extreme mood swings. I know some of it is due to my BPD too, but I can't tell which is which.  
I'm going through Hell at the moment, I'd rather die then carry on.  
And I can't get treatment while on the waiting list, which is 6 months. FML. </TEXT>

<TEXT> PTSD playing up like a bitch, BPD is playing up, got diaganosed with severe depression yet AGAIN last week.  
Been actually trying to deal with it, not cutting, no energy drinks as I was on 5 a day. NOTHING IS WORKING.  
I got reffered to therapy for PTSD, 6 month waiting list, but they can't give me offer me any help while on therapy.  
FUCK THIS.  
Might try Bridge again, but I have a massive fear of failing the jump.  
250ft down though, so right height.  
Would weed help with this fear?  
Never tried it, but can get it. I have a very low tolerance to stuff, due to my weight and I don't do drugs or drink at all.

<TEXT> You have 2 mental disorders. BPD and PTSD, PTSD is being a right bitch to deal with.  
Do not even attempt to brush your teeth at the moment, you WILL have a flashback as woke up from nightmare but been finding it hard anyway, that's why your mouth feels a bit weird, you've got chewing gum in your rucksack.  Wear long sleeves at all times.      
You have been having chest pains and trouble breathing with headaches and dizziness which is getting worse, had it over a month. Sitting down helps with dizziness. Doctor suggested blood test for Diabetes, but unlikely as underweight can be explained by eating not a lot, and tiredness is explained by not sleeping enough due to PTSD, have been peeing more but I do tend to more on period, that's irregular due to implant, which might be causing your thrush too. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Bascily is when I was 3 I was in Foster Care, with a very sexually abusive foster parent. 
He would sneak into my room when sleeping and feel me up, I am now can't sleep without a night light or something heavy near my bed. The worst thing he did was force me to give him oral.  
15 - Guy forced me to do the same under stairs at School.  
Some more stuff has happened since then, again at 15 abusive relationship with sexual stuff too, I've been felt up plenty of times since then from 16 - 21 most recent 2 months ago always by same 2 guys at College but I can get through that.  
19 - 20 had a VERY controlling relationship where the guy manipulated me into oral.   
Anyway, I can get through most of it, APART from giving oral.  
I feel really bad that I can't do it, he's never had one, we want to spend our lives together, which means he's most likely never gonna get one unless I can get over it. 
Been together 10 months, he finds it a bit frustrating but he said he'd rather have me then one oral.  
I just feel really guilty because he said that is what he is into when he was younger. We have made some small progress which wasn't really planned, like me sucking his fingers which he loves and I was getting quite close to his underwear area and I can spit on it and get pretty close to it.  
Like I can put it on my cheek now which he likes too but whenever it goes near my mouth I just freak out, like we've tried it gradually, we've tried just him tapping the head against my lips, we've him getting me extremely turned on and then him putting it against my lips, and that still freaked me out.  
We thought gradually might work to get me more comfortable about it, but I kept overthinking it.  
We thought that maybe just go ahead and do it because it might be the initial shock, nope that was the worst freak out.  
I can't really talk about this stuff either because I will just stop and shut down completely and just start shaking.  
He thinks we should stop because he doesn't want my mental health to tank, and he hates seeing me like freaked out and that it's so hard.  
I blank out so I don't know what I do, he said that all I want to do is hide into his shoulder and that I just can't talk at all or without a bad stutter and that my breathing is erratic. 
I want to do it for him though because it will just frustrate him and I don't want him to resent this.  
Any help?

<TEXT> Yes this!  
Or I get too confused with too much stuff going on, like my boyfriend would want to chat to me on the phone while I'm at the shop getting something, but then there's too much going on which makes me paranoid, which happens anyway in public without music.
Or if I'm trying to watch something and there's a conversation going on.  
I can cope with listening to music while in lessons, but only if the music is quiet and I'm familiar with the music.  
My mum said I've always been sensitive to loud noises anyway, but the most annoying which gets me the most riled up is beeping.

I'm not good at knots anyway due to a motor condition, only others is train but it would have to be at a level crossing, nearest one half hour away.  
Not anywhere that high enough,  and I find both of these a bit intimidating, but I have no luck with knots. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First one, I just crushed my windpipe, ended up making me cough. 
Second one, I did think I compressed an artery but I couldn't really pass out after like 20 seconds and it was getting really painful, but my eyes did go fuzzy and I am a bit dizzy and lightheaded now and I did the test around 15 mins ago 
Maybe longer next time or different positions?
Or I could of had it too far down due to the red mark on my neck, seems too close to shoulder and it only seems to be on one side.   
https://imgur.com/F96sRFh   
Hopefully it won't bruise
I'd say quite successful due to the actual compression but needs more work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's harder.  
I want to carry on cutting, but my parents found out and they went apeshit, not having that has made my mental health tank.  
So my appitite has gone down, and I've been getting told of for not eating and losing weight.  
Mostly a culmination, main events was 6 weeks ago, talked to police about abusive ex, he's in prison now, not for what he did against me but still.  
A month ago, got assaulted by a guy at College.  
2 weeks ago, boyfreind cancelled on me 3 fucking times so that made me so depressed, and the fact he was hardly texting, because he was ill apparently but he could still browse FB fine and message his best mate Ben?  
Oh, and when he does see me, he now can't see me for a whole day so I've been feeling abandoned, which is sending my BPD haywire.  
Today, there was a massive argument over the fact that ny sisters boyfrieind can stay for Xmas, but mine CAN'T, but the reasoning is my sister only has Xmas and Boxing Day off and she wants it to be family, but that's not all the days, but her boyfriend is still coming over, so it's not really fair IMO, I always knew that she was the favorite, I know I'm the family fuck up and they just prove it.  
Luckily, I  have the house to myself till my sister comes back from work, so I'm going to hang myself on the stairs which is what she will see when she first unlocks the door, she's so selfish, hopefully it will fucking destroy her like she's destroyed any self-esteem I had, I'm so worthless.  
She's the reason I'm such a bloody pushover. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So - there is no cure for PTSD, as it changes the brain structure, not the chemicals.  
BUT...big but, there is research into new treatment for it, and you can make the symptoms not complety dissapear, but so they are hardly there with the right treatment or medication with hardly any episodes, flashbacks, panic attack ect.  
Only problem is it's a complex disorder to treat, and it can take YEARS. Heck, I'm 21 and I got diagonesed at 16 and I still struggle, but keep in mind I have gone through another traumatic event a month ago.  
Anyway, if you are still struggling and you've tried everything, it might be a good idea to mention medication.  
There is also a new treatment called EMDR, which is where you follow a moving light with your eyes and recall the trauma.  
I haven't looked into it that much though, it's pretty effective from what I've heard, the only reason I haven't done it is the Doctor thought I've most likely got C-PTSD, not in the Mental Health Disorders Diagonsis Book, but he thinks that and BPD is the most likey diagnosis for me.  
You might want to check out a therapy called DBT too, and try to practice mindfulness too.

<TEXT> Yep, it's really fucking hard.  
I can't really tie knots right because of a motor condition., but even if I could, don't really have a place to do it. 
Pills/poison/chemicals - VERY low chance.  
Jumping, only one high enough (At least 250ft into water) is 3 hours away, 30 quid train ticket, and I've been stopped there before and had to run for it.  
Train - There is a couple of level crossing like 30 mins away, but I find the train indimating and I chicken out, and I don't want to scar the driver either.  
Can't order anything to my house as still live with family.

<TITLE> It happened again last week with the same guy that used to do it to me before. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-02 09:31:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Same guy I posted about a few weeks ago.
He did it, he fucking did it I can't handle it.
I was trying to ignore the fact it happened.
My boyfriend figured out something was wrong on Tuesday as I was shaking after sex, and got so annoyed over something he usally jokes about, and for the first time I walked out on him. I only walked into the bathroom and came back like 10 mins later after he commented on something I posted on Facebook.    
He kept on asking what was up, untill he went to the bathroom I texted him to tell him I kept running into him and my ex, I know my ex wouldn't do anything physical,  but he does make me regress.
My boyfriend kept asking if anything happened,  I wouldn't give him a straight answer but he wanted to know.  
He said he felt sick, sad and angry.
We can't do some stuff we used to sexually,  I'm finding it really hard looking people in the eye for that long and talking to strangers,  I can't even talk about what happened without completey shutting down, can't talk that easily, cant stop shaking.  
He tried asking some yes and no questions and said I could nod or shake my head, but I can't even do that.  
He wants me to go to College, but it's his word against mine, no proof.  
The thing is, I've been more moody since it happened, untill I told my boyfriend I just feel empty and very apathetic and I don't wanna be here at all, I'm hardly talking, I can't eat that much I'm hardly sleeping cant focus at all and truth be told I feel so sorry for my boyfriend.  
We were talking on the phone about it, I've never heard him get so upset, I felt terrible, I feel terrible that it's affecting him, I'm just so sorry, I'm so fucking sorry. </TEXT>

And how to make it so my parents won't find out what is it?  
I know they'll find out, but it's near Christmas so I'm going to pass it off as that, but I do not want the postman telling them, and I'm at College 5 days a week. Any help is appreciated, thanks. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We met in College and we started dating 8 months ago. I was doing well at the start of the relationship but my mental health has gotten worse, I've started self harming again, for a couple weeks a couple months back, stopped and I just started up again on Friday. 
I can get a bit snappy or moody with him and take things the wrong way but I'm always fine within a few minutes and I do take responsibility for my action.
I've never tried to manipulate him at all, we've never had a proper argument,  but he has been trying to get me back to therapy for months.
The thing is, I'm very stubborn and I don't take care of myself when it comes to my mental health. I've been making excuses to why I don't need therapy or why I don't have the time. Also the last time I started cutting around the same time I tried to kill myself by jumping up the Clifton Suspension Bridge but got pulled back, so he's now worried that's going to happen again, but I hardly have those thoughts anymore and self-harm helps loads.  
He's said that it's a bit draining which that I can appreciate, he said yesterday he doesn't want to leave me and he said a few weeks ago that he wants to spend the rest of his life with me, but this morning he sent me a text saying that we need to talk about everything. I'm seeing him in less then an hour, he sent me that a couple hours ago but I only relised what that meant a few minutes ago, and now I'm terrified about what's going to happen, I've been having such bad chest pains.
He's also been texting back shorter replies then usal for the last few days so I kept on asking if everything was OK,  he said it is he's just having also hard time coping with this but I think I fucked up everything again, I really don't want to lose him,  there is no way I can handle that at all, that might be the last straw.
Sorry for babbling but I'm freaking out and thanks for reading. </TEXT>

We were on the collections screen and we were playing a game where I had to choose a random champion and he had to tell me the name and damage.  
He got everyone right, apart from Zacs Damage, but he says that doesn't count cause it's a hybrid, and I keep annoying him but saying he got it wrong xD </TEXT>

<TEXT> My eating has always been off, but it's gotten worse. I only eat like at the most 3/4 of a full meal a day, with maybe a little snack.  
My family thinks my eating is doing alright, but they don't know how little I eat, they think I eat at College. I have lost some weight, but they have noticed my jeans are getting baggy.
I don't want to shower or get dressed or wash or brush my teeth.  
My sleeping isn't that good, but that could also be part of my PTSD. I also have BPD but I thought this was more suitable here. I can't concentrate enough in College.  
I don't socialize that much, but I do have people that let me when I want to.   
I'm thinking of suicide every day, it can vary in how intense it is.  
Luckily I know how to act so no-one gets worried.  
I don't actually get depressed that often, I more get frustrated or upset, but there are times where I cant reconigze or know what I'm feeling, or if I feel at all. Times where I feel numb, or nothing feels weird.
I'm meant to get my ID sorted so I can start drinking, so it can help. But I can't even get that sorted.  
I'm not normal, I don't do anything right, I don't really have any actual friends. People would do so much better without me.  
I have no purpose, and it would be better if I wasn't here, but I'm too fearful to go through with it just yet. Hopefully soon.  
I can't take this again, I hate myself so much. </TEXT>

I've sorta shut down and I feel tense, as in my muscles are all tense, and I keep looking over my shoulder. I didn't think he'd be back. I just feel really numb, but I have a feeling this isn't going to do me any good.  
I know he has some sort of learning disabilty, so he might not even understand even if someone tried to explain it to him.  
 I don't really have any friends that I could hang around with, but I could just go up in the LRC for my lunch, I don't eat lunch anyway, and music helps me loads. 
This is just me getting my thoughts into order, they are a bit racy at the moment. And I know my sleeping is going to get worse now.

<TEXT> I freaking HATE funerals.  
They are a waste of time, just a reminder that the person is dead and a whole service to "celebrate" their life.  
What if they were a terrible person?  
What if they didn't want their life celebrated?  
I'd rather be cremated, funerals are expensive and I would't want one.  
I do like graveyards, they just seem so peaceful and relaxing.   
And if I did have a funeral, I'd want this song to play as one big last FUCK YOU to myself.

If it's "I wouldn't have to do this/worry if I was dead" or if it was "I don't want to deal with life anymore" That is normal and non-worrying.

<TEXT> I was diagnosed back in April, along with C-PTSD, got offered Emotional Regulation Therapy, but declined and got discharged because I was doing really well. Fast forward a few months, getting moodswings, getting easily stressed for no reason, hardly eating and losing weight, suicidal and self-harming, along with my C-PTSD symptoms. 
But the thing is, I'm ok most of the day. But my boyfriend keeps on mentioning therapy when I don't think I need it. He said that I am ok most of the day, but at the same time, I'm not.  
I just think I can handle this by myself but he knows I'm gonna get stressed with College but I should to deal with this by myself. </TEXT>

And I'm thinking of more extreme ways of self harm other then cutting.
I wanna try bloodletting but I don't know what to use or the supplies.
I also wanna try chemical burns, like bleach or sugar soap, my Dad's into DIY so we got some liquids and my Mum is on a lot of prescription pills, and I got some string from an old hoodie. 
Oh,  and I weighed myself and I'm 53.4 kg (8 stone 5) and that is the lowest I've been in a while, I am really happy about that :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have C-PTSD from various sexual abuse. 
Me and my boyfriend have gone down to Falmouth for a few days, and we have been doing a lot of fun stuff, including dirty stuff. As I'm too embarrassed to initiate this sort of stuff, he usally does it but when I feel like I want to do something like this or afterwards, I just feel really bad for wanting it or I just feel so guilty.
I don't know why, I just do. It doesn't happen all the time, mostly when I start or iniate stuff.  
I always shake a little bit afterwards too but I'm ok with that these days, it's just I hate feeling bad about asking for sexy stuff.  
Anyone have any ideas about this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> He knows I won't talk about my feelings, he knows stuff that has happened to me, he also knows I use humor to cope.  
Not gonna lie, I make pedophile/rape jokes and all sorts of dark jokes, but really only in front of him because he has a dark sense of humor to, but he's said that mine is quite a bit darker, and I joke about things he wouldn't touch.  
He said that these things that have happened to me must bother me if I'm like this, and I do really see his point, and I'm not sure if he's right or not.  
He said I act like it's no big deal, it's normal (it kinda is for stuff like this to happen to me), but he knows me extremely well and that he can tell that it does bother me a bit.  
I'm not sure if it does it not. It's just something that has happened, I can't really change it. </TEXT>

I just hide away, make sure not to let anyone too close, I haven't cut/burnt in a while but my recent suicide attempt was like 3 weeks ago, and the people that know are on reddit.  
Just because you don't act like people think you should act, doesn't mean you still dont have it. People act in different ways. My Mum used to overreact, I don't react at all. 
There is actually another subtype of BPD called Quiet BPD, all the same symptoms, only difference is how you act.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is so much stigma surrounding mental health issues, espelly BPD. The main reason why I didn't tell my boyfriend untill a few days ago (Going out 6 months at this time) Was because I was scared that he heard all the bad stuff about it. He heard about it, but didn't know what it was, so I told him what it was in a simpliefied form.  
Luckily he knew I have had issues, so he just accepted and said he might not be able to complety understand it, but if I ever need to talk he's here. He's very supportive.  
My Mum has BPD too, my Dad knew someone was wrong within a year of meeting her, and accepted there will be some issues later on, he handled it well, when she went into hospital, he called her every night and visited her twice a week, she moved to a high-secure 200 miles away, he drove 4 hours there, visited for 4 hours, drove 4 hours back. All while raising a 2 teenagers, one with a anger mangement issue, with a weed problem and an eating disorder, and me. I went into hospital a month before my Mum, got out 7 months later, she stayed for 3 years.  
But he's supported everyone, my Mum is so much better, same with my sister, I'm the only one still having some issues.  
On the other hand, my bio Dad thought she was using it as an excuse.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So that was smart...oh why, WHY did I do that?  
The urge have been getting so much worse, but I've been getting by taking tiny overdoses (less then 5 each time) and I've only done that 3 times. I can't handle my massive moodswings, impulse, self-harm and suicidal urges.  
Also me and my boyfriend had like a couple hours chat on Saturday about my mental health, I've told him about my 2 diagnosis (C-PTSD and BPD) so he knows I've got some issues. But I got stuff of my chest, he gave me some good advice (One of them was stay away from depressing/dark/morbid stuff, and to stay away from one particular subreddit. He doesn't know my account, just that I'm on Reddit) That lifted my mood for a few days, but now I'm back to this. And I keep putting myself down, which he's really not happy about.  And I just want to say sorry to him but I'm good at stopping that.  
Him and my family want me to go back to the Doctors, but I really do not. I've been in treatment for just under a quarter of my life, but I wasn't getting treatment for BPD, where they did offer me therapy for it, but I decided to get discharged instead because I was doing so well. FML </TEXT>

I was 16 and got diagnosed with PTSD, Severe Depressional Episodes, Psychosis and Eating Disorder NOS.
A few months ago the diagnosis was changed to C-PTSD and BPD.  
I'd say that the BPD is more the emotional side, like mood swings and insecurity. My C-PTSD manifested like normal PTSD, with flashbacks, being overly anxious, but with the added symptoms of derealization/depersonalisation (Which overlaps with BPD) and hearing voices.
But I also thinks it really depends on the person and their individual symptoms. </TEXT>

With me, I'd say I have no real problems apart from my mental health, and my most recent attempt was just under 2 weeks ago, and then you see those really happy kids in poverty in 3rd world countries. There is actually more mental illness in the 1stt world countries, where people have better quality of life.  
It all depends on the person and their perspective.

I want to move out for College and come back on the weekends, so I'm living in the College dorms for the week. They won't let me, saying I can't look after myself properly and that I NEED to be at home otherwise I can't do the course!  
Like what the fuck, it's a least an hour bus journey :( </TEXT>

Decided to enjoy the view from the bridge.
Walked over to where I was going to climb.
Someone noticed me and came over and grabbed my fucking arm and wouldn't let go! Was going to call the Police but I ran off. 
Started feeling sick so I was going to take the bus back to the station. Threw up on the bus. Went to nearby Boots to get water and wet wipes to clear up, fainted so they called the fucking EMTS. 
Lied and said I had too much to drink, they wanted to call my next-of-kin.
Said my friend would pick me up, gave them my real name but fake address (oops!) 
Then walked to the station, got on the train. Got to the station I needed to change, got off went to a waiting room.
Fell asleep. Threw up again.
Then was asleep for the whole journey back.
No-one knows this has happened.

<TEXT> Hi :)  
First off all disclamier. It will get better, but it will not go away complety, you just learn how to cope with it and the symptoms then fade, but then it can come back with a vengance, but you will learn.  
I tend to listen to music and go for walks.  
But there's something called grounding techniques.  
This can be like getting an ice cube from a freezer and holding it in your hands, getting something to fiddle with, or trying to stop 5 things of differnt colours. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I suffer from mental health problems that are getting worse. Psychosis, Depresssion and PTSD. It's the PTSD which is really making life hell, espeilly the nightmares. I wake up terrified most nights and I find it really hard to get to sleep, which is making me tired and it's just making things worse.  
I'm already on Medication and I'm starting up therapy again.  
There are other things wrong. My Mum has BPD and she's starting to bottle up her emotions which is making me worried.  
My sister is going through a stressful time with her job.  
My Dad's physical health is getting worse.  
I'm worried about everyone in my family, and they are worried about me. I might get one of my friends who doesn't know how bad I'm doing to buy me a bottle of vodka if I give him the money so I can finally get the courage to jump. I just can't handle it anymore. Sorry for the long read. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me it's flashbacks and nightmares which affect me the most.  
I do get terribly anxious and have panic attacks, hypervilagence, intrusive memories as well, but by far the worse is the nightmares and flashbacks.  
Flashbacks can be caused by some expected things, some unexpected. Unfamillar bathrooms, old men, walking past my abusive ex's house, people grabbing me ect   
These can send me into being really scared, being suicidal or crying.  
Nightmare are worse for me. Flashbacks I can handle because I know more or less when they could happen, but waking up crying and shouting and being terrified is hell. I've been sleeping with a bat by me since I was 6. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 3 years ago, I was diagnosed with Severe Depressional Episodes with Psychotic Symptoms, an Eating Disorder and PTSD.  
I was hospitalized for 7 months. In the past year my Psychosis has been getting worse, even with meds and therapy but this is a different tactic my voices have never used before. They remind me of when I was sexually abused, by 4 different people and when I was bullied in school, which sometimes causes flashbacks. I am terrified and have no idea what to do. I was doing so well, taking my meds and I haven't cut in months. Now all I want to do is hurt myself, I have no idea what to do. I'm so confused and sick of this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I don't know what I'm feeling most of the time.  
We'll, 3 years ago I got Hospitilazed and diagnosed with PTSD, and eating disorder and the main one is Severe Depressional Episodes with Psychotic symptoms. This has developed into Psychosis which have been getting worse over the last year.
I've been hearing voices and seeing things for 8 years, had feelings of unreality and mood swings for 10 months, and I've been having delusions, lack of interest/motivation/focus, not been able to feel anything, sometimes being extremely quiet, blanky staring and been very suicidal over the past month.  
My Dad thinks it's Depression again, butI'm scared it's developing again into something else.  
I'm on 3mg Risperdone, which had to be cut down to 2.5mg as I was constantly suicidal. My meds are losing their effectivness but I'm seeing my Therapist and Psycharist today. </TEXT>

These metal health problems, even though the Psych Doctor said we need to find the root of the problem, I think I already know it. I think it's a mix of genetics, what happened to me in Foster Care, upbringing and bullying. I'm tired, I'm never going to escape. It's a day-to-day battle, even with my meds.  
I won't be able to keep myself safe if I carry on, this is getting to the place I was before I went into Hospital.  
I'm sorry for being a burden, and none of this is anyones fault but my own. I should've jumped earlier.  
Those daily walks? Walks to the multi-storey carpark to see if I had the courage to jump off. And I finally do.  
Maybe I'll finally be able to escape. Thanks for trying to help but I just can't be helped. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know, this time feels a bit different. This time I'm not letting my boyfriend know of my plan.  
I've been getting so paranoid recently. Been getting delusional, lights causing cancer, people recording me and the government brainwashing us through TV. It got so bad I was shaking on the coach back from College because of the lights. I've only been getting delusions for a week.  
And my Risperidone doesn't help with that, and it's been causing nosebleeds ever since it's been increased.  
Anyway, I think I'm done. Still nervous about dying but, fuck it. I'm doing this.  </TEXT>

The whole experience has made me feel so much worse. Hopefully next week I can finally jump.  
Edit: And they increased to 3mg Risperidone which I'm really really not happy about.  
Why won't they just let me die? </TEXT>

Some people just don't want to get better. I think the best bet is to talk to his parents and explain what's been going on. They will be grateful that you contacted them but he will be mad at first but hopefully he'll understand that you did it out of concern for him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, the main thing I have to deal with is Psychosis, I'm on 2mg Risperidone for it.  
Three years ago I was hospitallized and got diagnosed with Severe Depressional Episodes with Psychotic Symptoms,  an eating disorder and PTSD.  
My depression has come and gone since then but it's been very mild, but over the past couple of weeks my mood has been terrible. I've been more snappy,  I've felt down most of the time, I've lost interest in things and I can't motivate myself. My hygiene could be better.
I've lost my appetite and I'm sleeping more and I've got way more suicidal.  
I see a therapist for my Psychosis and I'm seeing her tomorrow so I might mention it then, and I'm tempted to call my Dad and say what's been happening,  but I don't know what to do.  
Any advice? </TEXT>

I miss the suicidal and I definlty miss the self-harm.  
Luckily I'm at College and I get stressed easily, so I'm gonna get worse. I've already started cutting again.  
But it's not enough. I hate being on my meds, I really really hate it, I wish they would just let me suffer.  
I deserve to suffer, I don't deserve all the love and concern.  
My boyfriend is going to talk to my therapist to see if my meds can be increases, I'm going to see if they can get decreased.  
I love my family and my boyfriend and his family, but they can all fuck off to high hell for this. I hate this, and I defintly hate myself for letting them get away with this. FUCK. </TEXT>

I had a stationary set that I bought a few weeks ago for College. My boyfriend knows my arms have been incredibly itchy and my voices want me to cut.  
I was going to break the sharpener open today while he was out,  but now he's taking the sharpener away from me while I was in a blankout.  
Now I'm incredibly pissed because he won't tell me when he hid it. But he's still going out today, so I told him I'm staying home so I can go up to Tesco to get another sharpener, he can't stop me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm 7 months clean. I suffer from Psychosis and SH,  this started when I was 12, I'm 20 now.  
I started College last week and I'm already under stress. The main cause of this is Danny,  the guy who was regularly sexually assaulting me last year did it again on Monday,  and I had to meet a whole group of new people who's already made friends, I was a late starter so I can't make friends, doesn't surprise me, who would want to be around me?  
Anyways, Danny has triggered my PTSD which has gone to one blankout every few weeks to an hour long blankout a day, which my boyfriend had to deal with as I'm staying with him, he shouldn't have to put up with me. I've also been getting more depressed recently.  
I made plans to hurt myself this week, but now I can't because my sister wants to go swimming on Saturday .
I NEED TO CUT NOW.

<TEXT> I suffer from Psychosis . I hear voices,  they are very negative voices that tell me I'm worthless, no-one would miss me if I'm gone, that I'm fat, eating too much, to kill myself etc...
I'm on meds and in therapy,  I tried to stop my meds about a month ago, lasted 3 weeks then made plans to go to a bridge.
Then my boyfriend texted my Dad to let him know of my plans, so I'm back on my meds, which I'm not happy about.
This might seem weird but I miss my Psychosis.
I miss the mood swings, voices,  unreality and breakdowns,  I especially miss my suicidal side.
All of that seems so natural, I've been dealing with it for years, and now it's gone. Part of me is missing. I should be dealing with all that.
It's unnatural for me to be on meds.
I think the reason I'm posting this is my parents forgot to make me take my meds, which they have to do otherwise I won't take them, and I didn't remind them. Today has been HELL but I've realised how much I miss it. 
Fuck it, I'm going to kill myself either way.

I suffer from Psychotic Episodes. I did take meds but I stopped them too fast without consulting my therapist and now I have to deal with the withdrawal symptoms.  
I hear voices all the time, they are constantly belittling me and putting me down, telling me to hurt myself and kill myself.   
My family knows I'm getting worse but they don't know how worse.   
My boyfriend knows about my mental health problems but my voices aren't letting me be honest with him anymore.  
On Monday I'm going to buy a box, climb over the barrier, call my family and let them know what I'm about to do, call my boyfriend and hope he doesn't talk me out of it again and let him know too, then jump.   
I've been in this place many times before, and now it's time to end it. Let's hope I'm not a coward. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've had it with College, my work experience and my whole life.  
I'm too stressed, can't get a break from the fucking voices, even with my meds. My family have no idea how much cutting helped before they made me stop.  
What I'm doing Wednesday is stabbing myself, slitting my wrists open and jumping in front of a train if I'm not a coward. But I am. Which is why I need to get drunk beforehand but I'm stupid and have no ID.  
The pushing point has been my ex doesn't know the meaning of the word no and likes to molest me. Godammit.  
My family and my boyfriend has tried their hardest to help, but overall it's become too much.   
This is also going to be my suicide note now so thanks to my family and Michael for trying.  
Please keep a very close eye on Michael, he said he can't live without me so   
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, DO NOT LET HIM DIE  
Hmmmmm what else can I put  
I've never got over the fact I was molested as a kid, been having bad nightmares about that.  
There is something else but I'd rather cut that into my body because that's what I've realised I am.  
Goodbye and thanks for everything :)  
I'm so so so sorry too.  
This post got a bit rambly, sorry to everyone that reads this

<TEXT> Yes, was in an adolescent psychiatric ward for Severe Depressional episodes with Psychotic symptoms, PTSD and an eating disorder. Very useful and what I needed at the time.  
Very structured and had all the appropriate support and programs to continue.  
But on the other hand, my Mum has been in hospital for 3 years in 4 different hospitals, and have had a different experience in each of them, so it differs for everyone.

<TEXT> Background: I'm a 19 year old College Student under stress that suffers from Psychosis and PTSD. 
I sometimes get these episodes of extreme emotional distress after being triggererd by something insignificant.  
Today it was me mixing up train times. These episodes usally last 10 mintues to half an hour.  
This is what usally happens in them:  
I get shaky.  
I get extremly upset on the verge of tears.  
I find it hard to calm down. 
I feel extremly suicidal and I need to hurt myself.  
I feel like I could explode.  
I either pace around or can't move.  
I tend to talk to myself and put myself down in these episodes   
E.G "I'm so fucking stupid why don't I jump under a fucking train"   
After these episods it usally takes me a week to recover and to function normally, it messes up my Collegework, my Psychosis get worse, my sleeping, eating, focus, my suicidal impulses ect.   
What are these episodes called and are they normal? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been diaganosed with Pyscosis and I'm on Abilfy for 5mg which has helped with my hallcinations and rapid moodswings I was having every few minutes with no cause, but I was wondering about this other thing.   
It's happened 3 times in 2 months and this recent one started on Monday. I'll try to be as clear as I can.  
I can't tell what I'm feeling, or I feel extremely great and bad at the same time.  
I feel like I could do verything at once E.G clean the house in 15 minutes or create a sympothy but I do get better at the keyboard during these periods  
I can't concerntrate at one thing for very long, this has taken me 20 minutes to type out.  
My self-harm and suicidal thoughts increase a lot during these periods but at the same time I feel extremely happy.  
I talk more rapidly and need less sleep.  
and more recently, heighted senses  
These periods usally last for 4-5 days.  
Advice?

Sharpener blades don't even hurt anymore. I need to figure out how to break open a razor or at least get my ID finally fucking sorted so I can get a Utility Knife.   
I hate the fact it doesn't hurt, it's the main reason to do it and I need it to survive and to carry on living.
I need to go deeper but I don't have the tools   
Goddamn it this is pathetic of me, it doesn't help that my blade is getting duller too:( </TEXT>

There has been some new symptoms and I have no clue what to do about them or why they are there. Sorry about bothering you again but I need to figure this out.  
For the past 3 days I have been feeling great and depressed at the same time, feeling a lot more irritable, I've been behind on my assigments for College but it feels like I could do all of them at once.  
It feels like my moods are changing rapidly as well. 
I haven't told my therapist any of this as it's only been 3 days and I don't know if this is important or not. </TEXT>

I have explained about me seeing things, me not eating, and things not seeming real, but not anything else. I did have to leave in the middle of a lesson yesterday because I was getting freaked out because things didn't seem real, but when things don't seem real it can happen for days at a time.

 I've been in therapy since I was discharged.
 I got sick of therapy and I've just gone 5 weeks without before I was forced to go back.
 Now my voices have complete control, if I don't do what they say I get so depressed, I'm now seeing things too. I did see shadow people, but now I'm seeing stuff like a poster being on fire or a floating gold orb in the middle of my room. I've never seen this stuff before. Nothing seems real anymore.
 I'm cutting everyday but I really want to cut deeper, that's all I can focus on at the moment, only thing that I care about apart from my music. What the fuck is going on? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hear voices all the fucking time, it feels like they are never ever going to go away. I do go to therapy for this but it's not working.  
Why  am I like this I hate this so much and I just want everything to stop and I'm too much of a coward to kill myself  
For those that don't know what it's like, imagine a bully following you around that knows your every weakness and flaw, who won't leave you alone, no matter what you do. And won't ever shut up.  
I've been bullied by my own fucking mind and I hate it. I wish I wasn't a coward.

<TEXT> So, I hear voices. A lot of the time and therapy is now not working. I'm not eating that much and I'm just so fucking sick of hearing them. I have been hearing them for 6 years and I've been in therapy for about 2 years, this therapist for 6 months.  
My parents think I'm doing ok-ish, they know about me not eating much. I do not talk about my feelings at all.  
The thing is, I've tried to kill myself at least 6 times, and they only know about 2 of them. Apart from knowing my luck, I'll probarly fail or chicken out. AGAIN. Unless I get drunk before and jump in front of the train, I know where they don't stop. At least my voices will finally leave me alone.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been under a lot of stress recently.  
Home, College, Over tired, voices getting worse, ect.  
On top of this, a couple weeks ago after bodyboarding, my sister noticed the scars on my legs from the cuts I made about 3-4 months ago, and yesterday one of my friends noticed the scars on my arm from a couple years ago.  
I'm now feeling a tad self-concious about that.  
I also checked my emails and got one from the Funding and Residental department who wants to chat to me so now I'm shitting myself.  
And it's not my egs I want to cut, it's my arms. And it's summer.  
I might just scratch it a bit with a paperclip.  
Edit: Paperclip didn't help. Might just cut myself after all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Late, but oh well.  
I'm pretty sure when my ID gets here I'm likely to drink...a lot.  
I have mental health problems, and when I drink it makes me feel normal and forget stuff. I got drunk a week ago, I have felt cravings for another drink since then.  
Getting drunk helps stop the MHProblems, and I AM going to therapy but it isn't working. They always come back.   
When I drink they don't bother me. I can't cut like I used to as it's the summer and me and my sister like going bodyboarding, so I can drink instead.
I can't wait till my ID gets here.  </TEXT>

I'm sorry about what happened to your sister.  
I'm not sure if they do want to be friends with me or not, or if they do or not and I'm not sure if anyone else even likes me.  
It is pretty scary, epescilly if they bring in nucler arms. I like in the UK so be close r to the fallout if they did.  
I don't kniw and if they did they won't admt it.  
Tbh honest that's truve even if it is just in College :)  
Ah, I used to play Footbal at 2 clubs but had to ostop to go to College :(  
I used to love Football, played DF most of the time.  
I seem silly when I cry, and when I do cry, it's never in front of other people cause I walk off i f I start crying

<TEXT> I'm an idiot because I ca't tie a simple noose. I have dyspraxia so it's hard for me to do stuff which invovles hand-to-eye cordination stuff, like tying knots or sewing.  
I know crying is normal but I hate it because you feel horrible and your nose gets sniffly and it makes me feel weak.   
Your Nana seems like an amzing peron to be able to become a nurse.  
I don't know if I do make a differnce though, the only main diffrence I can think is my 2 friends will stop hanging out in my room at break at lunch.  
I know people are trying to help and I'm trying to take the advice on board but it feels too much.  
Well, I'm pretty sure my sister is my fave chiild of my parents    
College I'm worried about what I'm doing next year and the fact that I'm doing a work pacement next week but I'm not sure what I'm doing at my wp  
I hear voices, I did learn CBT but  its not helping and even though I'm seeing a speclaist for them it's not helping  
I feel like my friends are tired of me and are talking about me  
I can't get to sleep to like 2-3 am in the morning (its 1 now)

<TEXT> Hi there, I decided to post here instead of /r/suicidewatch because I feel like I'm bothering them.  
My mental health has tanked recently, yet again in the suicidal state.  
On Friday, I tried entering a 9 story building so I could jump, but you needed a key and passcode to enter.  
Tonight, I was looking for something to hang myself with. I was about to get my shoes on to go down to the Tool Store when I know there's good rope there when suddenly...I had a phone call from a friend who's fell out with his Dad. He was pissed off and he knows I'm a non-judgemental person who'll help.  
The phonecall lasted 45 mins. It's just hit me how close I came again.  
1 proper suicide attempt and 1 nearly if my friend didn't ring...2 in one fucking week. He doesn't know what I was about to do.  
This is what I felt like before I got admitted a couple years ago.  
I still don't want to live.

<TEXT> I can't live anymore. I'm getting sick of everyone and everything, nothing is intresting to me. I've been going to Therapy for my voices, but it isn't working anymore, they just won't stop.   
I'm not eating or sleeping that much and I'm feeling ashamed of myself that this isn't working and the fact is I'm getting worse again and treatment isn't working. This might seem stupid but I can't go a day now without an enegry drink or I get more pissed off then usal.  
I'm beginning to loathe any times I have to speak to someone.  
I feel like a burden and a failure.  
So I've decided. I've been planning this for a couple months now, and I still got ideas from a couple years back.   
I've done my reseach on how tall building must be and stuff like that.  
My College Class is going on a trip. Found out on Tuesday. I've only been thinking about jumping off a buiding/bridge is from where the place we going is. But I've had a worse day then usal and it's came to a head tonight.  
 I've researched  the tallest building nearest, and there's one a 20 mins walk away. If that fails, there's the bridge I could take a bus too. Sorry for the rambling or formatting but Atm I can't care less. </TEXT>

He then took me aside away from the others, and said: "What the fuck, I saw you nearly go into the path of that truck, the fuck do you think your doing?"

<TEXT> It did for a bit, but as my 18th birthday was coming up I had to be moved onto the adult services. I thought I was fine and decided not to.  
Now I' more near the plae I was before the hospital then after.  
I don't want to go back though as I think it'd be better if I didn't bother them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not really looking for advice, this is more of a vent then anything.  
I'm fed up of being scared and on edge all the time. I'm pretty sure they're watching me and laughing at me. I can see the signs they are watching. I
 I hate the fact that I'm not strong, fed up that my Mum won't be at home for another 2 years, at least.  
I hate th fact that I can't get to sleep anymore, I just stay awake. I should stop eating. I hate that my CBT won't work on my voices anymore, I hate that I can't talk to my Dad about this as I don't want to make him worried.  
I want to cut but I can't in case Ollie sees and now Blake knows.  
So I've decided to try others like bruising and overdoses.  
The ODing works good for me, but I can't get them as I look under 18 and my Dad won't get them for me.  
I hate my PTSD I hate my thoughts I hate everything and everyone and I think I shouldn't be here anymore.  
When I try again, it'll be my 5th and hopefully my last attempt as I'm choosing a more fatal method. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is to do with my mental health, rather then my phyiscal.  
For the last couple of months, my voices have been back, and so are the shadows which appear in my vison.  
I did have to be hospitalized for 7 months back in '10, for PTSD, Depression and Pyscosis. I've already noticed my PTSD has been triggered by me going to College, but I can deal with my PTSD quite well now.  
But how I'm feeling and reacting to this now is different.  
The shadows can come across my vison now, making it seem like I'l looking through a black spiderweb.   
My CBT isn't working for dealing with my voices, and I can't ignore them, but I've been having conversations with them. There are 2, they both say bad things to me but 1 sems good but is actually helping the other to undermine me again. Back when I was in Hospital, there were 3, I knew who the voices belonged to. But I don't know who these 2 voices are.  
Instead of the sadness I used to feel and suicidal thoughts, it's just me sitting in my room for hours trying to convince myself that people aren't watching me, or the BEKs or demons under my bed aren't going to get me. I feel like I'm getting tracked or being watched through my webcam too. This happens nearly every night.  
Also, I've gone back to self-harm, but it's mostly taking tablets now. I'm not really eating or sleeping (It's 1:36 AM)  
I know I shoud go back to the Doctors but I just can't be bothered.  

Edit: Wait, thought of something phyiscal! I have really poor circualation in my hands, so they're always cold. Been that way since I was little. Also most recently, back aches and I'm feeling sick for no reason, but that's most likely because of my self-harm.  
Sorry for the long post, spelling and formatting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know how, but College has made me worse. I got bullied in School and I have PTSD, so it might be that.  
The voices are back, I'm self-harming again and not eating that much.  
My sleepings gone bad again, I'm convinced people don't like me and I'm getting depressed again. I feel bad for feeling like I should die though. I'm residental on College, so I'm away from home 5 days a week. My mum is in Hospital and I think I'll run out of money. 
I've been getting more tired but not wanting to sleep, and more recently, I have been thinking about S.Methods again. I've already tried kiling myself before 3 times.
Sorry if it's not clear and all shambled, but I don't want to fight against my mind again.   
Also, I've just keep shaking for no reason sometimes, and that's annoying too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not exatcly sure who I would talk to.  
The main reason I don't want to ask is because I'm sick of having to talk to someone, even though I hate having them.  
This would be the 4th time in 3 years, it would feel like I'm wasting thier time, because like a couple months after I start talking to someone, I slowly get worse again. But I'm sick of having these problems, and I'm sick of having to talk to someone about them.  
Also, my PTSD got set in the middle of class today with no obvouis trigger. It was really bad the first halfhour, but the last hour and a half it was a bit milder. How it affects me is it depersonalizes me, and about 2-3 people noticed in our class of 12. I have no idea why, and that scares me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My Mental Health problems are getting worse now. It's not just hearing the ocosanail voice like it was a couple months ago.  
I'm pretty sure College has triggered it.  
My PTSD is getting worse, I'll just zone out at random times now, forget something from 5 minutes ago or a period of time...as I live in Student Accomadation, I have to have the door locked at all times, even when I'm in the room, I still can't keep the door to my Bathroom shut either.  
Let's see what else...I'm starting to skip meals, I tend to aviod human contact when possible, I've started to cut again, and the voices are worse. Also, I belive the College is watching me through my Webcam, may be using a Keylogger on me annd other stuff.  
I'm worried about the future of my Country, and I can't help but feel that Life is only gonna get harder. I won't get help as I feel like I'm wasting their time, and I can't be fucked to try to get rid of these again. I'm 18, and I've had Mental Health problems since I was 12.
I'm also having sleeping problems, genrel fear and people are watching me and are trying to spy on me and doing stuff to get inside my head. People don't like me and it'll be benifical if I was dead.  
And this has only started today but I keep on feeling insects crawling on me, but when I look, there's nothing there.  
 Yes I know spelling, grammer and formatting might be fucked. In this moment of time, I couldn't care less.

<TEXT> I think the College is watching me through my Webcam, using a Keylogger on my Laptop, and I think people are talking about me behind my back. I have to keep the door to my dorm-room locked at all times, even if I'm in here, because of trust issues. I have to keep my en-suite door open if I'm giong for a piss or a shower. The voices have also decided for this to be a great time to pop up again.  My eating is going rapidiy down. I really don't want to ask for help a second time.
And I used to self-harm at 12-16, did it a couple times at 17, and now at 18, I want to do it again. Fuck.  

Sorry, I really can't be fucked with this, and sorry if your not allowed to swear here.
And sorry if this ain't the right place to post this.
TL;DR Mental Health problems are getting worse.  </TEXT>
