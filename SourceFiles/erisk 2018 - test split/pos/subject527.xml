<TEXT> This brought tears to my eyes! I am telling you that you can do it. Before my surgery I struggled every day with the same feelings as you...I had no idea if anything was working and I always felt low on energy. Just give it some time and you will pull through. Just try to focus on something positive and happy :) I find the sunshine really helps me...when i'm feeling low because I've had a slow week or I'm lacking energy I sit in the sun :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was on metformin and duramine but they made my heart feel incredibly....'fluttery' (only word I could think of) and I stopped sleeping. I looked like a speed freak haha. I did find though that it helped my blood tests and I was feeling better during the day. 

It is really hard...I remember when I was first diagnosed I thought my whole life was over. I was only 16 I am now 19. I just completely withdrew and I think that made my depression a lot worse but I researched a lot and relied a lot on my family and boyfriend.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) Thank you. My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years now and he has helped me through EVERYTHING that has come my way. He is my biggest motivator because I just want to be healthy and live a long life with him. 
2) I did 6 weeks of liquid diet in preparation for the surgery (that was so hard because of the sugar) but I lost between 5-7 kg I think. Basically the doctors just wanted to see that I was determined enough to stick with liquid only in order for them to believe the surgery would work.
3) Eating now is so beyond different. I can only eat about a cup of food at a time depending on how heavy it is. If you imagine a single portion yoghurt tub I can only finish one of those. 
4) I try to work out about 5-6 times a week. Depending on my schedule. I do little things when I am on my days off like washing clothes and vacuuming the house. Little things add up. I like to walk, run and anything that involves being outside. 
5) In preparation for the surgery I had to have counselling in order to work through some previous trauma that my doctor thought my inhibit my success but now that i have lost so much weight my state of mind is completely different. I still have down moments like everyone else but I am able to control my emotions so much more now. I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and mega-depression (plus a few others that i can't remember) but just by working every day to be a happier person I am getting there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me, I started slow. I know I had the gastric sleeve but my main focus for the first couple of months was to get my attitudes toward food balanced again. It took a while! But I also didn't want to start working out until I was at a comfortable weight that wasnt going to hurt my knees, back and lower portion of my body. I found that the pool (Perth gets really hot) was the BEST thing for me, once the stitches were out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A whole new person is an understatement haha. I used to take for granted all the small things like, playing with my nieces and nephews and sitting on the ground without needing help to get back up again. I now try everyday to find something that makes me abundantly happy and I try to be so thankful for everything that comes my way. 
Thank you for your kind words :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The biggest challenge for me was changing my attitude towards food and trying to tell myself that I am not missing out on anything but gaining so much more for my life. I have also had to experiment a lot with what foods I can tolerate now. For instance, I cannot drink milk or eat rice. Both leave me with terrible stomach pains but other than that the list is endless of foods I can enjoy. I have already begun incorporating exercise: I go to the gym, I run and I go to a place in Perth called Jacobs Ladder which is something like 227 stairs.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mine is hormone related and Insulin related. Yes everyone can be at a healthy weight and unfortunately I'm not 100% sure why i couldn't do it the natural way but I have been on shakes, pills, all the healthy eating diets, fad diets EVERYTHING and nothing worked...at most I would lose 3 - 4 kg and that would be over 6 months.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have got two syndromes that, paired together make it near on impossible to lose weight. If I was diagnosed earlier there may have been something that the doctors could have done but by the time we realised something was wrong simple medications wouldn't have been enough.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm too afraid to post this to Facebook...

Some of you already know but a lot of you dont. On the 4th of February 2014 I underwent the Gastric Sleeve Procedure. This involves the removal of 85% of the patients stomach. A few people that know I have had this surgery dont understand why I did it and why I thought it was best for me. 

I suffer from a condition that makes it virtually impossible for me to lose weight but, all too easy to put weight on. When talking to my surgeon and my specialist they both informed me that my projected weight in two years time would be well into the 200s. I was not happy with myself at allno confidence, no spark left and no humour anymoreI just wanted to be a hermit for the rest of my life. 

It took me well over a year to decide that this surgery was the right direction for me to go in. I spent countless hours researching, finding the best surgeon in Australia and talking to my mum who is a Doctor. After considering alternatives and trying multiple different diets I decided that I would take the plunge. I booked in to see a psychologist, a dietician and the surgeon of my choice. The process had begun

After 5 months of preparation and 3 weeks of liquid diets the day of my surgery had finally arrived. I got to hospital, was put to sleep and woke up in a whole world of pain. I was placed in the ICU because my blood pressure was barely measurable and my heart rate was dipping. Apparently I am allergic to every pain medication there is. I dont remember much of the 36 hours I spent in ICU except for the pain. 

Two days later I was sent to the regular ward in which I was able to talk liquids through an IV and begin sampling different soups and high protein fluids. The first phase was really hard, I felt miserable (probably from the anaesthetic and other medications), and I was alone; most of my family and boyfriend working all day. After 8 days I was allowed to return home with strict instructions and a very sore abdomen. 

It has now been 2 and a bit months since my surgery and I am 41 kilograms lighter overall, and 22 kilograms lighter post-op. I am astounded at how this surgery has changed my lifeI am a new person. My confidence is back, I am wearing clothes I would never have dreamed off and I am so much happier. 

I know a lot of people have told me I am living a lie because I post photos of my weight loss and my gym shoes but the honest truth is; THIS IS NO EASY FIX SOLUTION. The weight does not simply fall off and it certainly does not change the problems/relationships with food in your head. I am not living a lieI am being ME. I am so proud of everything I have accomplished in this short few months. A giant Fuck you to the people that told me I am living a lie and portraying something I am not simply because I dont want my life story on Facebook.

That is all. </TEXT>
