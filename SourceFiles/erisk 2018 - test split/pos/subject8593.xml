<TEXT> That looks really similar to a Keel Toys or D S Nicholass bunny. I can't link at the moment, as I'm on mobile, but if you search ebay for those two brands followed by 'rabbit' it throws up a few of them in all different colours and sizes. The only difference is that yours seems to be missing the foot pads those two designs have and they have flocked noses.

<TEXT> Your points are spot on. It's sad that most people aren't educated enough on rabbit welfare to realise 4x2 is way too small for a litter of babies, and especially too small for more than one dwarf adult. :/

Edit: And on top of that I'd like to add that they require daily (if not constant if possible) access to a run of at least 6x8 - just in case anyone sees this and thinks just putting them into a 2x4 hutch/cage and leaving them there is reasonable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You could certainly give it a shot and try a different one, if you're all out of other options. That pain is truly awful, so I feel for you. 

I can't be 100% certain that going on my BC was the thing that stopped it, but I do know that I haven't had any pain since around that time, so... it makes sense.

Funnily enough, I've just come off my pill, so if that pain comes back I guess I'll know for sure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know what the cause of this is, but I've had it too! Exactly the same as you describe it! So you're not alone. Mine went on for about a year. When I went onto birth control (Microgynon, a year ago) it seemed to stop, as I haven't had it since. 

I've also since had a pelvic exam and while I do have cysts at the opening to my cervix, they're benign and the doctor can't see any reason for the random pain I was getting.

I'm so sorry that you're feeling this too! I don't have any answers, unfortunately, but hopefully it's somewhat comforting to know you're certainly not alone in feeling this and that I got the all clear from doctors too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh wow. I think that dream might be even worse than the last one! When I was having my really bad ones, I was seeing a psychologist at the time and when I explained them to him he told me that horrible ones like that were usually a manifestation of anxiety and possibly a side effect of the medication I was on at the time too. I was dealing with really bad anxiety/depression then, so it made sense! I don't know if you have anything making you a bit anxious or worried, but it's something to think about! :)

I'm trying to remember mine, but it's been *so* long since I had any. The only one that really sticks with me now is very NSFW! one I had about walking through a park at dusk in autumn. The path was windy and littered with leaves and I eventually came upon a huge black tree in a clearing. It had a massive thick trunk and was stripped of leaves. All the branches were gnarled and reached up into the sky, pointed at the ends, like claws. 

A woman in a white dress was sitting in the bough of the tree. She was sobbing. The bottom of her dress was covered in blood and blood was gushing down the trunk of the tree from between her legs. I knew, somehow, that she'd been raped so violently that she was bleeding out, but I was rooted to the spot and couldn't move to help. I must have stood there for about ten minutes as I watched her die. I remember looking down at my feet and seeing that the pool of blood was almost touching my toes. Then I woke up. 

Also just remembered a dream which is super fragmented, where I'd been kidnapped and bundled into the back of a car at night. I managed to get out and started to run away but the attacker grabbed me by the foot, tripped me up and then hacked off my leg at the knee with an axe. I managed to crawl away through a field before waking up. 

Man, dreams are so weird!

<TEXT> Well, you have a sewing machine so you're already well ahead of where I started out! I had to sew all my plushies by hand for the first year! 
Honestly, the best advice I can give is to just jump straight in. I'm completely self taught in regards to sewing, and this is how I started out. 

Buy a metre of cheap fleece fabric (fleece is great for learning to plush with, as it's forgiving of mistakes and easy to find in large quantities.), an old pillow you can rip open for stuffing and find yourself a simple plush pattern that you quite like. 

[This](http://gurliebot.deviantart.com/art/Darling-Plush-Pattern-127849093) sort of pattern is a good thing to start with. :)

I think the biggest secret though, is just determination. Your first few will look like crap. Expect it. But know that you'll get better by plush 4-5 when you've figured out how everything goes.

(If you ever need any help with anything when you get started feel free pm me!) </TEXT>

<TEXT> That sounds a lot like the dreams I have when I'm anxious about something. I always end up back at highschool and can't find the class I'm supposed to be in, or I've forgotten my P.E kit. Horrible! 

Omg, I can never find the patience to crochet scarves. I've started a few but given up on them after a ten or so rows. Do you have any tips on how to stick with one and get it finished? I feel you on wanting more room to sew, I'm currently working out of a tiny 7x6 box room that also has my bed and wardrobe in, as I'm lodging with my grandparents. It gets really stressful sometimes. I know I'd be more productive if I had more space and didn't have to use my bed as a second desk, haha.

I think the hardest part was deciding to quit my day job and actually take on the plushing full time. I'd been working in a ridiculously unappreciated retail job for six years and from the way they treated me/their workers I was convinced I was pretty worthless and couldn't ever do anything else. At the beginning of this year I ended up at the doctors with a badly worn down rotator cuff in my shoulder from folding t-shirts on tables for five days a week for six years and either the job or the sewing had to go so I could rest. I chose to quit my job and try make a business out of the sewing. It took three weeks of laying in bed to make the decision and it was absolutely terrifying. Probably the scariest and hardest thing I've ever done in my life. Best decision I ever made though. 10/10 would go through weeks of paralysing pain to do it again. </TEXT>

My god, I bet that plush was difficult to create, I can't even imagine the amount time he would take! In general it's not that difficult to get into plushing though. Especially if you already have sewing and crafting experience. I taught myself completely and before learning, the most I'd ever sewn was a button. It's really just a matter of jumping in head first and having the determination to try again every time you mess up - cos you will mess up a lot.

They're all vintage inspired, so I use a lot of up-cycled and off-cut fabrics and accessories to make and decorate them. :) I also do other animals now and again, and make a lot of Pokemon and Pony inspired plushies.

<TEXT> Oh, so many Redditors after my own heart. *Swoon*. I've been lurking here periodically for a bit now and finally decided I should just jump into the fray. I love giving presents and with the holidays coming up it seemed like a perfect time for me to get giving. :)

Anyway! Hello, I'm Debbie. I'm 25 and I'm from the currently incredibly wet, grey and miserable North of England (though, to be fair that kind of describes it all year round). I'm a big book lover (transgressive fiction is my favourite) and wannabe novelist. Into manga and anime and video games. 

I'm currently self employed, running a little business from home sewing plushies and cute things for a livin'. Work is super busy at the moment, so I'm pretty stressed and weighed down with deadlines, but holy hell, I love my job. Getting a lovely message from someone once they've received their plush is, hands down, the best feeling in the world. I would do it for free if I didn't have three hungry pet rabbits who try to eat me out of house and home. 

Does anyone else craft at all? Anyone into sewing? Want to learn how to make plushies? I'm trying to have a crafty clear out and I have quite a bit of scrap fabric and other odds and ends such as buttons sitting around that I'm trying to find a new home for. So if anyone is interested in taking them off my hands - free of charge! - let me know!

So uh... ask me anything, if you like, I guess! But you must answer me this first: **What's the last dream you remember having?** </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a lot to do with the fact that rabbits are the UK's third most popular pet. But like you mentioned, number one most neglected. :/ They're readily available in almost all pet shops and marketed at children, but are rarely handed over with any sort of educational materials for the new owners. Despite them being the third most popular pet, we have no laws on keeping them - only very vague guidelines that state that they need to be kept in a 'suitable' environment for their breed, kept safe, fed and watered. (We have a few rabbit charities which are fighting for rabbit welfare laws, however.)

Unfortunately this leads to the outdated concept of keeping a rabbit in the smallest hutch possible in people's back gardens with inadequate food and forgetting all about it. Then to local teenagers stealing rabbits from hutches 'for laughs', and ultimately either setting them free into the wild (usually with their pet dog on its tail) because they don't know what else to do with it, or... doing things like this. 

Rabbits getting stolen and then tortured by scummy teenagers is really common in the UK. I had one taken from my garden when I was a kid. :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm always making little toys for my three to play with. Rabbits definitely tend to prefer the edible kind the most! Here's a few ideas that I use.

Buy bunches of different twigs, apple, willow, kiwi etc and tie them in bunches or shapes, then either leave them around on the floor or hang up as a chewable mobile. 

You can also dip slightly wet branches (or lollipop sticks) into dried herbs then set aside to dry and you have tasty herby twigs!

Get some small pieces of hessian jute. It's a woven natural material. Put healthy treats/herbs/flowers into the middle of the square, then pull up all the sides and bunch them together making a little sack. Tie the top and you have a little throw bag for the bunnies to sniff, scratch and try furiously to get into.

Peg veggies and edible flowers from a long, tied up piece of string to make edible bunting! in the same vein, thread dried fruit and veggies onto some twine and hang up for an edible garland.

<TEXT> I'm actually interested in this as well, as I had no idea that their rabbits were rescues. There's no information in their store about it whatsoever. I'm sending another email to the regional manager, so I'll ask about it and see what rescue/charity they're paired with - if any! I'll mention the bonding and ask if they've tried alternate flooring too!

Gosh, if he really is a rescue then I feel even worse for him, getting 'rescued' only to be stuck in a tiny cage in a pet shop all day serving as their store mascot!

Also, would you mind sharing the websites you do your bunny supply shopping with? :) I've tried a few like zooplus, but I just find them so expensive and then with all the shipping costs on top, compared to physical stores. I'm shopping with Pets at Home mostly (as they gave us lots of advice and help with finding vet care for Elric when we first rescued him) but would preferably like to find an online store that has an extensive rabbit range and won't cost me an arm and a leg. </TEXT>

'Bumper' is not the store's meet and greet rabbit as I used to visit at least once a week, if not twice, and every pen has always been occupied by single black rabbits for months on end. This was my first encounter with Bumper, who is all white. So he does not 'usually occupy one of the rabbit runs' in the slightest!

Bumper 'pushes' his hay away and doesn't like it in his area. He needs this survive! I can't say I've ever met a rabbit who pushes away hay, unless they're playing in it and digging! And this doesn't mean you take it away from them altogether!

I'm just at a loss for words. I'm not sure what else to do except contact the RSPCA. :( I wish I could rescue poor Bumper and get him away from there.

Please, please UK Rabbitors, don't support the Jollyes company, as even their higher management aren't educated in animals' needs.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all HUGS to you. 

And secondly, all of my bunnies are made to order. :) All the originals in the photos sold quite a while ago, so each one is now made after purchase. Custom bunnies are always welcome! 

I have a listing here where you can mix and match fabrics and colours that I already have in stock to create your own unique bunny. https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/169159108/custom-bunny-rabbit-plushie-you-design?

Plus, if you don't fancy any of those fabrics, you're completely welcome to suggest a colour/theme to me and I'll see if I can source some new materials that are within my budget. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> No way! Lionheads are one of the most common breeds where I am. I also have a mini-lion. :)

Ollie was a lucky find, though. I was in my local pet store buying bunny food, when I saw him. He'd been given to them by someone who couldn't/didn't want to take care of him any more. He was in pretty bad condition. His coat was super brittle and dry, he looked absolutely miserable and all of his mane was completely matted to the point where when I watched him try to wash himself he got his claws stuck. I immediately took him home! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you! I've never really been a fan of mass produced soft toys. I loved stuffed animals and have been obsessed with them as long as I can remember, but I've always been ridiculously picky when it comes to which ones I want to own - even as a kid. I'm even less of a fan of them now that I make my own and can see what a huge difference there is between handmade and cheap mass production. 

I do try to market them as collectors items rather than toys. While they are very sturdily made, they probably wouldn't stand up to too much rough children's play. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you so much! :) Ah, good question! When designing the bunnies I really wanted to keep the face area as simplistic as the bodies just to keep a balance, as there's always a lot going on in their ears and around their necks. An embroidered nose cluttered up the top of the bunny too much. Plus, rabbit noses are often pretty much hidden with them resting a little bit under a flap of skin. I figured the triangular point of the head seam mimicked the 'v' shape of a bunny's nose well enough just on its own. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks, I understand it might not be immediately clear to other people how much materials cost and how many actual hours of work go into the plushies. A 6 inch bunny at 25 costs me 8 and six hours of work to create. A bigger and more complicated plush like the Pokemon/Ponies, can cost up to 20 in materials and can take me 24 hours of work when the shifts are combined. 

(This doesn't included the weeks of work I spend drafting and proto-typing my plush patterns before I can put them on the market.)

This is my only income, and so I treat it like a full time job. Most of the time I'm not even meeting half of minimum wage. There are some plush artists out there who often charge two or three times the amount I do for a similar product.

I appreciate your honesty though. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you so much! Honestly, I came to plush making with absolutely zero experience in sewing. It was a long, steep learning curve, but once you've made a couple of plushies from some simple free patterns and got a hang of the basics, the rest just follows. :) You should give it a go! If I could do it, I'm sure other people can too! 

(And if you're stuck for where to start, what patterns to begin with, what fabric to buy as beginner etc etc, just pm me!)

I do sell them! I've actually recently been able to quit my horrible retail job and do the plushing full time. :)

I know, I think I keep getting stumbled upon by parents just looking for a cute toy for their child. They're so used to being able pick one up dirt cheap, they don't realise that when they try to offer me 7 for one they're being really offensive, hah. I guess it's not their fault.

<TEXT> Oh wow, thank you so much for your compliments! It always means so much more when it's coming from someone who's not necessarily my usual target audience! They definitely feel as nice as they look, I make everything out of premium minky fabric which is so soft it's like heaven melting in your hands. :)

And honestly, it's nice to meet someone who understands the price for hand-made too! I've had a few people tell me that they're overpriced, but when a rabbit alone takes 4-6 hours for me to make, and the materials alone can cost 8 for one, my actual working pay isn't much!

They're all totally handmade, yeah, and 90% of everything is actually sewn by hand too, the old fashioned way. I only really use my machine for embroidery and for sewing large areas or long straight lines. 

I did have someone recommend I take my design to a merchandiser once before! But, really, I'm reluctant to do so, as I feel like it would lose it's integrity almost. Manufacturers would use much cheaper fabrics and every design would look like an exact copy of next. Whereas when I make two of the same design, even though I use exactly the same fabrics they always turn out a little bit different due to the prints being placed differently while cutting, and all the buttons I use are mix and match. A manufacturer wouldn't be able to copy that and I feel as though that quality is the biggest part of their charm. :)

Please let me know if you ever do set up your shop, I'd love to see it!

Then six months in I met my S.O - who's a professional photographer, so he supports me by offering to do all of my photography now. I did see quite a jump in sales in general when I started offering higher quality photos, but in terms of which items sell the most it's quite even. The listings with the professional photos sell just the same as the ones with pictures taken on my phone camera. And before he came along and offered his services I was still doing pretty well! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you so much for your compliments! It means so much to me to know that other people enjoy them as much as I enjoy creating them! :)

Custom bunnies start at 24 for a short upright eared bunny and 25 for a lop eared bunny. These are for standard bunnies like the ones in the pictures with printed fabric inside their ears, solid minky bodies and ribbons and bows. All in your own choice of colours. Extra markings and any printed fabrics I have to order for the bunny (say if you would like certain theme that I don't already stock) have a small added cost.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you so much for your compliments, they mean the world to me!  

Honestly, for me it was all just about perseverance. I had never sewn anything other than a button before (and terribly at that!) so I had absolutely zero knowledge of what I was doing when I first took up the hobby! My first attempts were awful, haha. But I stuck with it because the process of making something from nothing, something physical that I could hold and feel, made me feel great, no matter how bad the plush turned out!

I'm sure of it's possible for me to make something out of nothing by just using pure determination, then other people can do it too! 

I wish I could give you a hug too! And I hope that you eventually find the project that inspires you enough to stick with it, like sewing did with me. :)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're very welcome! I only wish I had a magic wand that could teach everyone to sew! I didn't have a sewing machine for the first year, I would stitch everything by hand (usually while sitting in bed all day hah). Then last Christmas my boyfriend bought me a lovely sewing machine as he was sick of seeing me struggling to keep up with the sudden demand for my bunnies. I couldn't hand sew anything fast enough! 

The machine he bought me is a fantastic machine for both beginners and the experienced. He got it from amazon: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Janome-J3-18-Sewing-Machine/dp/B0036UODH2/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8 qid=1405696476 sr=8-3 keywords=janome+sewing+machines

It's super easy to use and isn't too heavy or too loud. I would definitely recommend a Janome machine for a good combination of cheap price and good quality, and wouldn't recommend getting one priced any lower.

I was actually bought an unbranded machine that was half the price of that one (and pink!) for my birthday last year by my grandparents and never touched it. I was a complete novice (had never touched a machine before) but even I could tell that it wasn't sewing straight, couldn't turn corners and was maddeningly LOUD! Hah. 

So yeah, always get the machine that you can just about afford, rather than the cheapest. You'll be so glad that you did when you get it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you! Do you have pictures of your jewellery? I would love to see them, if you're up for sharing! Deciding to sell on Etsy is a scary step, I was filled with so much doubt in the beginning: Will it sell? Will people even like it? What's the point? etc. But there's really nothing to be afraid of. 

You should definitely give Etsy a go! It costs $0.20 to list an item for a few months (or until it sells). And generally the more items you have in your shop the more you will sell. And hey, what's the worst that can happen? Things don't sell. Nevermind! You haven't lost out on anything. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> They're insanely priced! The Brother machine that sells for 800 here can be bought for 200 in the US. It's a ridiculous mark up! I bought this one: http://www.overstock.com/Crafts-Sewing/Brother-HE1-Embroidery-Machine-Refurbished/8261670/product.html?refccid=AY2U2FBVW7HJB5CJ6LAXU7TIWQ searchidx=2

You pay a small custom fee on purchase (around 20) so that when it gets imported you don't have to pay the 40% import tax! It runs beautifully and the only issue is that with it being an American product you need to buy a conversion adapter. I picked one up for 25 on amazon and it's been perfect. 

So even with the added import fee, the delivery cost and the price of the adapter, I ended up spending less than half of the UK price. 

Ahh it's shame you're so far from uni and have no way to transport it! The offer still stands if you get to uni and decide you want it though! I can't recommend http://www.plushaddict.co.uk/ enough for when you're on the search for fabric!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh my gosh, and your sweet comment made me tear up! So much love and hugs to you 3 and for buying one of my bunnies as well! Thank you so, so much for the support. 

It's been a rocky road, but after losing everything, relationship/home/etc/including myself, I realised I had to do something to help myself get out of the hole I ended up in. No amount of help from meds or other people was going to do any good. The problem was in my own head and therefore I knew I had to be the one to fix it. Channeling all the frustration from that realisation into something productive really saved me. There were days where I would call in sick to work and just sit in bed sewing from morning 'til night as I couldn't bear to face other people. It seemed crazy at the time, but it worked better than any medication or therapy ever could!

I wish you luck with your creativity and battling your own demons. And I really hope you eventually find a craft that you can stick with! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do have an embroidery machine I use for the pokemon and pony eyes. I had to have it imported from the US as the price for the same model is 4x the amount here. 

You're in the UK too, right? I have quiiiite a bit of fabric laying around that could use a good new home. Not so much fleece/minky but a couple of bits that can be used for small plushies and lots of smaller printed pieces that can be used in patchwork or as little accents on plushies. I have buttons and ribbons and safety eyes coming out of my ears too, that I don't use. If you want to send me your address I'll make you up a little crafty package and send some over! Totally serious! 

I'm a huge scrap hoarder and desperately need to downsize (living and working out of a box room at the minute!). So I'd love to be able to send you some if you'd let me! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks! I had absolutely zero experience before I started making these. I did, however, always have an obsession with stuffed animals, so I was pretty determined to make one that looked half decent when I first took the hobby up. It's a bit of a steep learning curve if you've never sewn anything before, I had some major struggles early on (and still struggle now and again), but it's totally do-able if you're dedicated and don't let a few set backs put you off!

My advice would be to buy a metre of fleece material, in your favourite colour, from any craft shop. Fleece is great for beginners, its a bit stretchy, easy to sew through and can hide a multitude of sins, hah. Then have a look for some simple patterns to start with. The first plush I ever made was from this cat pattern: http://kapuschati.deviantart.com/art/Pattern-for-Plushie-Cat-165817462

Though there are probably some easier ones if you search deviantart. I had trouble with the belly on that one the first time.

Sew everything with the 'right' sides (the side you want showing on the outside) pressed together and the 'wrong' sides showing. Leave a gap in the edge stitching and turn your piece the right side out. :)

I wish you luck! Let me know if you ever start any plushies, I'd love to see how they turn out! And if you ever have any questions/problems, pm me! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you! I started off sewing having only ever sewn a button on a pair of trousers before (badly, at that!). It's a steep learning curve for plushies, but it's completely do-able if you ever want to get into it and teach yourself. :) The bunnies generally take a minimum of four hours, but can take up to six depending on all the little accessories and such. And the more complicated things such as the Pokemon and ponies can take anything from 8-24 hours of solid work.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Aww, thank you so much for your kind words. Honestly. The depression and the medication/psychiatrists combined completely stripped me of everything, including everything I thought I once knew about who I was. So when I started crafting not only was I working with a blank slate, but I myself was a blank slate too. As I created hundreds of little plushies, I created a whole new me in the process, working from the ground up. It's been a very strange but also very liberating experience.

I do take requests! I was actually able to quit my horrible retail job a few months ago and go full time with this whole plushing thing, so commissions are my best friend, haha. I've never tried a human doll before though, so I wouldn't be comfortable with that yet. Maybe in the future though! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Aw, thank you very much for your compliments, they mean so much! I'm sorry about your struggles with depression/anxiety. I did find that the meds completely robbed my creativity. My main hobby had been writing ever since I was a little girl and I was determined to become an author up until I started on the medication. But as soon as I started taking the meds there was just nothing. Just a blank space in my brain. I felt like it had totally stolen my whole sense of purpose in life - if I couldn't write, I couldn't live! 

So I actually took up crocheting with the advice from a friend who was also suffering with depression at the time and found that it helped her. The monotony helped me relax and slowly over time I found my creativity seeping back in a whole new hands-on way. 

I came off medication at the end of last year, but I've still not been able to write a word of fiction ever since. Every time I think about writing or try to write I actually feel the anxiety returning, churning in my stomach, so I don't try any more. I fear it's forever linked with that terrible mental state now. Which is upsetting considering it was my whole life for over twenty years, but at the same time, I'm so grateful with what I have right now and the ability to create SOMETHING at least. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think your prices are perfect. Your work really is art! People often underestimate the amount of work that goes into handmade items and that's quite sad. Just goes to show how comfortable - and maybe blinded - we've become with cheap manufacturing.

I also sell plushies on Etsy and I've just recently quit my job to take it up full time. I regularly have clients playing between 25 - 125 ($40 - $214) for my items.

Keep up with the amazing work, your plushies are adorable! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah, that is unfortunate! But thank you for the compliments! I'll definitely be up for a commission in the future. Plushing is literally my full time job, so commissions are always open (for anything!). Gotta pay those bills! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you! I've done a ton of standing ponies recently and just felt the need to draft up a new plush pattern and try something a big different. :) </TEXT>
