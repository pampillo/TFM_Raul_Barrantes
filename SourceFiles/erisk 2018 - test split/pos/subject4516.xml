<TEXT> My main power animal is the red belly black snake, but i am also visited often in dreams and while journeying by the wedge tailed eagle and kookaburra, both natural enemies of the snake. In dreams I am often the snake, and often the bird chasing the snake. Both spirits have guided me through journeys in other realms and times and in lucid dreams. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lol. I know, I know, correlation does not imply causation. But srsly you don't think that's a high percentage of people who are living with trauma? I've checked multiple sources and they're all roughly the same. Trauma doesn't always come about from violent crime, war, natural disaster but more commonly from complex trauma such as physical, emotional, sexual abuse and neglect from a caregiver. I'm Aussie and it's roughly the same here too, which is a high number of people but in the US that's massive, over half the population is overweight and well over half have been abused in childhood. It just blows my mind. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not always depression, in fact depression is often the last thing people consider. Which is why I brought it up, it sounds like OP's wife isn't only overeating but also giving up a lot of the other things she loved, and self isolating, all of those are symptoms of depression. It also sounds as if it is not solely overeating that is causing her to gain weight, she has also had a drop in physical activity.

In short, I'm not using depression as an excuse for overeating, I'm making a hypothesis based on the information I had available. It's just a hypothesis until it is tested. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes I agree, but one of the hardest things to start is an exercise regimen when you are struggling with major depression. Believe me, I've been there, I used to be super fit, but it was as if I knew exactly what I needed to do, but just couldn't push myself to do it. Once I began medication and seeing a psychologist it got easier, but None of it was simple. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Could it just be possible that she is depressed? I know my fitness regime went right out the window when I was, and I used to be so fit. I also used to have many extracurricular activities, dance, drumming, choir, hiking, regular catch ups with friends, that I really enjoyed but slowly gave up over time. If you love her, try and see beyond the surface issues and be there for her to listen without judgement and support her, she may not be depressed, but what she needs more than anything is your support. Nobody ever started a gym membership because someone judged them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hopefully someone with more knowledge will be able to provide an answer to that, I'm not from there, from north-western NSW, but my mum was a midwife in Yirrkala for some years before I was born. I would google the local land council and maybe find a contact you can email who could give you more understanding of the nuances in that deity's story and wether or not they thought it would be appropriate to use this as your planet name. I've seen a few posts here about cultural appropriation - and the  feeling is generally that its not a good idea. 
I'm also a big fan of sci-fi and think the sound of a planet found and named by aboriginal people sounds cool, even quite subversive of colonial motifs - having the opinion of someone of that culture might even give your story extra depth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would be so careful as so much appropriation, theft and misuse of aboriginal culture has taken place over the past 200 odd years. You really should not only rely on your internet research, a lot of what you may be reading was probably written by white people who didn't really understand or care to try and understand the intricacies of the stories they were setting down. Bamapana is cited as a Mungin deity, Murngin was what white anthropologists called the Yolngu people, perhaps reach out to Yolngu people and ask how they feel about the use of this deity in your fiction, it may seem of little significance to you but could be a major insult to them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm Australian, and what you describe is very close to how I understand the world and other realms. I feel deeply connected to the land, plants, sea and animals, on both a physical and spiritual level, also to other planes of existence, the "everywhen", the lower, upper and middle realms, the before, now, next. My animals are red belly black snake, kookaburra and eaglehawk, I take their forms in dream, their energy assists me in waking life. It is difficult to describe all of it text, but it makes more sense to me than a European based paganism, although some of my ancestors came from Europe, most of them have been here for tens of thousands of years, so the connection is deep. Also, all of the solstices and equinoxes are back to front down here, compared to up there, so it just makes sense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here in Aus we have these GP super clinics, all bulk billed, so I walk in with whatever ails me, and walk out with a prescription , a referral to a specialist (which is either free or highly subsidised), whatever I need. And it costs me nothing, sure a teeny bit of money comes out of my tax and goes towards this for everyone, but who cares. I'd rather my tax dollars went to public health than to making war. This was crucial when I suffered major depression last year, I just walked in, got a prescription and referred to an incredible psychologist, I've since been referred to a dietician and physio and I truly believe that had that not been so easy, I probably would have killed myself, I can't imagine how difficult it would be for people in places without universal healthcare. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks, I am currently in therapy for trauma and major depression, part of my recovery has been rediscovering my spirituality, returning to practicing my own brand of witchcraft and nature worship. My therapist talks a lot about embracing the shadow and she is quite esoteric, so I'm not awfully sure wether she is talking about it in the Jungian sense or the magical sense, or wether both are the same thing. At any rate I thought I would read up on it all and get a better sense of it and how to include it in my spiritual practice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a self initiated sort-of antipodean hedgewitch. I don't follow a Wiccan or Celtic pagan path, I feel that my practice is very influenced by place and where I live. I'm deeply connected to nature, animals and do most of my magic either outdoors in the bush, or in the lower and middle realms whilst journeying or lucid dreaming. I'm quite solitary, in fact have only just started "coming out" about my witchcraft, which has helped me begin to heal from a log struggle with major depression. My husband describes me as being quite like a younger version of Granny Weatherwax in the Discworld novels, and thinks I should perhaps fashion a sign saying "I aten't dead" for when I go journeying. I'd love to meet other Aussie witches and spiritual types, and talk about how you weave your magic in this beautiful paradise where we are fortunate enough to live. </TEXT>

I believe that the essence of us moves on, but personality is made up of so much lived experience, failures and triumphs, each new journey brings new challenges, caregivers and friends who help to shape us. Don't worry so much about retaining your personality, it's not the most important part, your essence is what will live on. The Aboriginal people from the area I live believe that we are all travellers, we come here from space, live a short while and then fly off into the universe on the rest of our incredible journey. They don't fear death. I have memories from my lives before, I love this life, but I know this isn't the be all and end all and when the end comes, wether expected or not, I will be ready for the journey. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In terms of the Salem witch trials, it had nothing really to do with a belief in witchcraft and everything to do with taking advantage of the the naivety of the general populace and their belief in evil stuff and gaining the land of the people accused by putting them to death. Those teenage girls have a lot to answer for. Pretty sure that a big part of Massachusetts experienced about three years of famine after those trials as while the powerful gained the land of those they put to death, they didn't have anyone to work the land as all those able bodies were in jail. Totally backfired. I kinda feel it was all Tituba's revenge.

<TEXT> My altar is a collection of things that a representative of the elements, the lower, upper and middle realms, my ancestors and the god and goddess.

They are all things that I've picked up on my travels through this world and then have been charged with power picked up by my journeys in other realms. A stone I found on the shore of Lake Ontario that has a spider web pattern represents earth, along with some hematite and a bowl of salt, some pumice from the volcanoes of Santorini represent fire along with some rose quartz and a candle, shells I've picked up locally and in Spain with clear quartz represent water and the plant kingdom, and my smokey quartz represents air along with a beautiful fluffy Kookaburra feather I found in my backyard where my kookaburra friend likes to visit me every morning and evening. In the centre is a sculpture of a tree with the roots trunk and branches representing to me the lower, upper and middle realms or the axis mundi. I also have a variety of candles, usually something living like a plant or flowers, and photographs,pictures and curios representing my ancestors. The assortment varies, sometimes more masculine elements lie opposite those with a more feminine feel, sometimes they swap sides, reside together, change areas altogether. It feels right to me, it feels safe, warm and loving, it's my safe space and a doorway, it a place where I can embrace both purity and do shadow work with impunity.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The first few visits I was incredibly guarded, they were so hard and I spoke about everything but my personal trauma, to be fair I was in an incredibly bad place physically and mentally on those visits. I probably was pretty close to making an attempt and I had been self harming and was really sick with a virus. But after awhile on some meds (SNRI's) and three sessions, the psych had set up an incredibly safe space where I felt comfortable and not judged. She also asked some incredibly insightful questions, she had guessed I suppose by my affect and presentation that I had some trauma responses so she gave me some body based interventions to do as homework and I was able to make up my mind that I needed to tell her about what happened to me. At the next visit I told her about the trauma and without crossing any boundaries she made me feel completely accepted and blameless. 

I'm still a long way off accepting what happened and I'm still fairly depressed despite the meds and therapy making me feel more at peace, but I feel I can make it through. I live in a country where we have a good public health system so I found this an easy process once I had decided to do something about it. Not sure if it's quite so easy in other countries. If I can give any advice it would be to try and find a psychologist who specialises in trauma informed therapy and practice. And good luck. PM me if you need to talk more. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can relate to you on this, I have experienced personal trauma and also vicarious trauma through my profession and for the longest time I didn't seek any help due to negative experiences with counsellors at school and university. But recently I was diagnosed with major depression and found an incredible psychologist, it has helped me so much.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We are all individuals and on different time frames on or journey through the magic of eternity. We are all travellers in the universe. By the time your life on this earth ends your first love may have moved on to another life, plane, dimension. Meeting them again may take Millenia or seconds, you may not know them, you may know them immediately, or you may meet your second love and meeting your first love may have to wait for a later cycle. Time on this plane is complicated enough that we have to try and control it with clocks and timelines, what makes you think time will bend to these rules in the worlds beyond? I have had the experience of meeting someone who I had loved before, we both had this incredible "knowing" but in this life I am meant for another, we are on opposite sides of the world, at different stages in life. He still sends me messages every few months "someday I will come to you or you to me-perhaps in another life". It's bittersweet, but it is all part of the journey. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm always thinking I'm in the wrong Sub here as I'm not Wiccan at all, although I am a practitioner of magic. I'm more of a hedgewitch or wise woman. Anyway the idea of a totem or power animal comes many indigenous cultures, and shamanistic practices. I'm Australian so it makes sense to me to practice magic with a more antipodean name slant, as such I journey a fair bit through deep meditation, to the lower realms, to a place of power. It was here that I met my power animal, the red belly black snake, who has stayed with me and assisted me despite me not asking it to. 

The meaning of your dream may be that your connection to these animals or spirits is pending, awaiting your journey to meet them. Or you might just have had a dream about butterflies because your friend mentioned it. At any rate to meet your power animal start practicing meditation, and lucid dreaming.  </TEXT>

I guess he probably used weed and alcohol to gain more confidence, but I knew him outside of just a social context and got to know him when he was sober as well as drunk or high, and it was the real him that I fell in love with, the sweet, shy guy. By the same token he got to know me with and without medication, on meds that didn't work and those that did. When I was mad crazy passionate and when I was curled on the couch for days. I can't speak for him as to what he was attracted to initially, but years later, I can say that it wasn't the crazy out of control me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for clarifying, I still find it difficult to understand, but whatever floats your boat. Just so you know, depression and anxiety are mental illnesses that make it difficult to control ones emotional balance, as are BPD and other personality disorders, schizophrenia, Bipolar disorder and PTSD from complex trauma (childhood abuse, sexual assault etc - also causes of depression and anxiety disorders) not going to run through the whole DSM-5 but you get the gist. As well as suffering from depression I work with people who have mental illness (probably by far not the only one out there - probably one of the major maintaining factors for my illness) so I've a fair amount of experience with the different ways that mental illness can manifest behaviourally. I can't give you any tips on how to attract this guy, all humans are different, and I can't think there is one typical presentation sexually for a person who is emotionally disturbed, some may be disinhibited, others may be terrified of sex due to trauma. I'm thinking your crush might be into the former, a free spirited type. At any rate good luck. </TEXT>

I also work in the industry, so I've first hand experience with women who have various mental health diagnoses. And for OP trying to get tips to act more mentally ill to attract this guy, I don't know, I mean I could give her lessons, but it still leaves me feeling a little cold ya know.

<TEXT> I don't use spells to heal anybody but myself (or very close friends if they ask for it) and I have never used curses or used magic in ill will against anybody. I might be in the wrong subreddit as my particular brand of witchcraft is more akin to that of the hedgewitch or wise woman than Wicca and I am very connected to nature and the land of the country I live in. 

I am an empath, in that I feel the emotions of others, and others find it very comforting to confide in me, and I can feel at them, helping them know they are understood, accepted, not judged. This skill is helpful with both the clients and those who care for them. I have a way with words that can persuade without being didactic, observing other's behaviour and planting the seeds of change within them without actually telling them what they should or shouldn't do. Nobody can make change happen for another person, but with skill you can set them on the path for them to discover how to change themselves.

For the rest, I connect to my place of power within, to draw strength, to find courage and to dissolve any negative emotions that I might accidentally integrate. For that I cast the a circle each morning and night to centre myself, but I can always connect to that place of power wether through deep meditation or simply envisioning it when I need during the day. </TEXT>

And you wish to emulate this anguish to try and attract him. Please, tell me if I'm missing something here because I hope I am.

Edit: also, mental illness isn't a sexuality. People who have mental illness have a sexuality sure, as with all people and as with all people theirs is as nuanced and varied as anyone else's. Sometimes their sexuality will be affected by past trauma from abuse or sexual assault, sometimes not. Again, I'm all ears if I'm totally getting this wrong but it is really kind of offensive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I immediately thought of the rainbow serpent who is a powerful creator god and possibly the oldest continuing deity or belief on earth. The rainbow serpent is deeply connected with creation, life and seasonal cycles, rain and water, thunder and lightning, blood, circulation and the menstrual cycle. I'm Australian and my power animal is the red belly black snake who I think is an aspect of rainbow serpent and represents ancient knowledge.

I'm not suggesting appealing directly to rainbow serpent, I'm not sure which country you come from, I imagine if you're in France, appealing to rainbow serpent might not do you much good. I just don't know about the cultural appropriation aspect. But maybe look into local indigenous mythology, or the mythology of your own people, you might find a snake god or spirit in your own backyard who will protect your animal companion. </TEXT>

Then look for some porn that she might actually like, Erika Lust makes brilliant sexy and romantic hardcore porn, so does Lucie Blush. Or you could have a look at r/chickflixxx 

But no, don't go giving me guarantees of what you imagine romance novels to be like, I'm a woman, I'm currently reading Voltaire's "Candide" and on the side I'm reading a Mills and Boon called "Testing the limits" lol. I consider them stress relief, I have a very full on job. They are absolutely more nuanced than Fabio clones pursuing innocent housewives. Here's a thing, instead of making all these assumptions about your wife, find out what she's into. Maybe reading a couple of romance novels might actually be the key to your current situation.

Edit: my comment about the disconnect between your ideas of a fulfilling relationship had less to do with the porn aspect and more to do with the romance aspect. The fact you make these assumptions without actually finding out what she likes about romance. And let me just add that ALOT of women don't like the idea of porn, I love porn, certain types of porn, but there is a lot of porn out there that is utterly degrading to women and makes me feel quite ill. I have lots of female friends who like porn as well and we share the sites or filmmakers we love, but I also have friends for which it is an absolute no go. No amount of persuasion will change their mind. But yes, women like reading novels with sex in it, but it's is a type of sex that is rarely shown in porn. If you care to find out more, perhaps read Diana Gabaldon's "Outlander" series, that's the kind of sex a lot of women like. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, maybe go back and read my comment when you're feeling a little less emotional about the issue. I'm definitely not "chewing you out". I have in fact been in a very similar situation to the one you describe and I'm merely asking you to look a little deeper than the surface issues in an attempt to figure out a solution. 

For the past few years I had been having issues with my partner, he would rarely initiate and would never reciprocate if I did, making me feel unwanted and undesirable, I gained weight, lost my fitness level, I blamed it all on the lack of sex, I became fixated in the sex I wasn't having. Then I was diagnosed with major depression. It wasn't the lack of sex and feeling undesirable that made me gain the weight, it was that I'd stopped caring about everything, stopped dancing, singing, going to the gym, all the things I had loved and had kept me physically healthy. I was suffering from the effects of personal and vicarious trauma due to the work I do. My mood was very low, I was prone to anxiety attacks and inappropriate emotional reactions. I finally got help, medication and therapy, and now things are starting to normalise, our sex life has returned, we've even done it twice in one day! Unheard of before. It turned out that my moods were affecting him as well. 

I'm not saying that this is the issue, all I'm saying is to look a little deeper and stop playing the games (like the one where you stopped touching her boobs altogether because she asked you not to while the kids are around-which, while it would totally not bother me, is a pretty normal and healthy boundary to draw) Start trying to see things from her perspective. Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 666 is the number of the beast which is some biblical crapola, but It's also a totally kickass song by Iron Maiden which you should probably listen to because it totally rocks like a mofo and Iron Maiden are pretty much the best band ever, but it has nothing to do with Wicca, it just means that your Uber cost that amount.

<TEXT> My father was English and of Norwegian descent, my mum is Aussie and her grandmother was an aboriginal woman. As long as I remember I've had a great reverence for nature and the intricate workings of the universe. I used to walk barefoot through the bush where I lived and animals would approach me as if they were tame, snakes and birds. I get messages in dreams and have been meditating and journeying since I was very young with guidance from my mum. As a teen I began to practice magic as well as yoga and set up a beautiful altar, practiced herb magic and connecting with the spirits of the four directions and other realms. I guess I really began to believe in my power when I started to have premonitions and warnings and the things I got messages about in my dreams and meditations began to always come true. 

For some reason I stopped my practice for some years, probably as I started building my career, but recently the universe is telling me in no uncertain terms that I need to pick it up again. Which I have, and people are noticing. I've been stopped in the street a number of times in the past week, asked if I am a healer, told I have an aura about me. It's like my spirits have rushed to speak through me again. The birds have begun to visit me again and eat from my hands, sit in my shoulders. A koala even visited me!

I guess I'm not really a pagan in the same sense of this subreddit, but I do what I do and it serves me well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One woman I worked with was virtually locked in after a devastating car accident that left her with a severe acquired brain injury, needed a wheelchair, non verbal, she still had movement but no actual control so her body would jerk constantly and she could not do anything for herself. I was convinced that her intelligence and personality was still alive behind her outward appearance and I don't talk to any of my clients as if they are stupid or childlike. It was incredibly frustrating working with her and emotionally draining, as she would cry constantly, but eventually I learned to close my eyes and feel the way. After that I was able to at least feel her acceptance or dissent to certain tasks and give her time or present things differently. Empathy is a very real talent that some people have. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I found Rae Beth's book "Hedgewitch: A guide to solitary witchcraft" helpful, I used to dabble in witchcraft as a teen and in my early 20's.  I also used meditation and lucid dreaming from a very young age for relaxation, centering and deep journeys of discovery. Somewhere along the line I lost my practice but never my spirituality. This book helped me figure out what's important to me and how I wish to continue in my practice. It has helped me pull myself out of major depression. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Having just begun to see a way out of major depression, I'm glad I got help, because in hindsight I can see just how close I was to suicide.
But it was incredibly difficult to get that help, both because I was slightly in denial about how bad things were, but also because a lot of my attempts to talk to friends and family about it were brushed off, I think because I'm usually so bubbly and irrepressible that people simply didn't believe I was serious.

So, I would urge people to keep an eye on even their most fun loving friends, and believe them when they say they're not coping and offer assistance.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Passion.The first time he kissed me we ended up in a storeroom together because he made up a story about some thing he needed and couldn't find and I knew where it was, while I was searching for it, he closed the door behind us and as I turned he just gazed at me. I came up close to give him the thing, he took it out of my hands and placed it on the shelf then we just sort of melted into each other. We had to pretend we were doing something else when someone barged in. We were perfectly matched, our kisses were perfect, from the most passionate, push everything off the table and go at it to the most chaste kiss on the cheek. He would wink at me and stick his chin out and just point to his cheek and I would oblige, or he would wait behind a tree and grab my hand and pull me to him and kiss me passionately. It never went further than that, but the attraction was mutual and it was undeniably strong. It was years ago now and we have gone our separate ways, we are with other people, in different countries, but he still sends me messages like "One day I will come to you - or you will come to me" I doubt it will ever happen but it's nice to know he still thinks of me, and remembers that passion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh mate, I dithered as well, it's probably been a year of blaming how I feel on other things, and if I'm really honest it's probably been two years, and if I'm really really honest the anxiety part of things has been there all along. I think partially because of the industry I work in I downgraded my symptoms and thought "Well I don't have it nearly as bad as client a,b or c"

I guess I just ran out of things to blame it on last Friday and I was genuinely afraid for my wellbeing and this was the only thing I hadn't yet tried, and the only other option would have hurt other people far too much. I'm sorry I made it sound so simple but believe me, I feel you. But thank you, I'm glad I did it, and having you compliment me like that really means a lot. Thanks troll xx </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you. I feel confident that this particular GP will refer me to a psychiatrist if she feels she can no longer help me. As I said in my other comment, I've had some pretty poor experiences with GPS in general and you're right they aren't confident with the nuances of psychotropic meds, but a good practitioner admits that and defers to a specialist, in the past I just had my dose doubled without discussion of trying something else. But I'm partly to blame for that because I was young, I had no clue about the medical and mental health system, in fact I really had no clue about my own body and emotions, I think I initially described it to the GP as having really really bad PMS all the time. I know a fair bit more about how it all works now, so I'll be out there advocating for myself. Thank you for your kind words. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm starting on Effexor an SNRI and already had some gnarly side effects the first and second day, second day not as bad as the first so hopefully I'm metabolising it better but I'm off work for the next four weeks so I hope that the meds reach the therapeutic level by the time I have to be functional again. I took an SSRI when I was younger and I was scared to go on one again as I became quite numb and unstable on that, but so far this SNRI is going ok. I know a lot more about myself these days and how to speak up to medical practitioners about my body. 

It is a difficult system to navigate, the last time I asked for help after a close relative died, I asked the GP for a mental health plan and he told me to just go and ask for counselling at the hospital palliative care. He could not grasp that this wasn't purely related to the death, but that the death had been the catalyst for a lot of bad feelings to surface. That was a few years ago and I've been trudging on since then. In the industry I work in I've found time and time again that mental illness is a diagnosis of marginalisation, and despite all the good work that beyond blue, project air etc do, the wider community is still afraid of big emotions. Thanks for the offer I may just need help navigating his one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for your kind words trolls. This is the most beautiful, funniest and fiercest online community. I'm going to make it, I've been struggling for years with anxiety and depression, used meds when I was younger but got better at the self care and didn't need them anymore. I work in a stressful job in community services and past six months the depression has become acute, it took me a long time to recognise it. Over the years I've brought it up with General Practioners but none of them have been helpful, and to be honest I probably downgraded my symptoms and since I work in my job I felt selfish asking for help. Last Friday was the worst day I ever had, I can only describe the feeling as Artax in the swamp of sadness. I was sinking and trying to wade through and the harder I tried the slower I went. It hurt. It was anguish. I spent the weekend thinking it over and I went to a local clinic that bulk bills and got help from a lovely woman doctor. I now have a plan to keep safe and despite the initial side effects of the meds I'm going to hang in there. Thanks trolls.  </TEXT>

Eddie Koiki Mabo
Pemulwuy 
Ruby Hunter 
Vincent Lingiari
Charlie Perkins
Ryan Griffen
Charlie Perkins
Emily Kame Kngwarre
Tracey Moffat
David Gulpilil
Jandamarra
Lea Purcell
Wesley Enoch
Stephen Page
Deb Mailman
Archie Roach
Evonne Goolagong
Nova Peris 
Linda Burney
Sally Morgan
Briggs
Deborah Cheetham
Casey Donovan
Jessica Mauboy
Dan Sultan
Gurramul
Mandawuy Yunupingu 

Those are just a few of my heros. I know some of them did fight and die in battle against the invaders, like Pemulwuy and Jandamarra, but their stories need to be heard. Pemulwuy is a particular hero of mine, as is Eddie Mabo, being a unionist. I don't know of many Canadian indigenous heros though, would be great if you shared. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Crickey! Well my only answer is that something really shit happened in those 8 year between my creation and yours, something really crappy. I really don't think there are any such things as girl toys and boy toys but I have noticed over the years a real return of 1950s style gendered segregation of children's toys and clothing. When I was growing up at the beginning of the 80's it was popular to dress little kids (at least in my parents social circles, and they're feminists and socialists) in whatever they wanted to wear, so I'd be in blue overalls and striped t-shirts. But as the decade crept on and definitely during my sister's childhood (who is roughly your age) the pink for girls and blue for boys thing started to really come back in a big way. I just don't understand why! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a fair amount of experience with Borderline Personality Disorder, first of all, it's very tough supporting and loving a person with BPD, so good on you for caring and loving her. This diagnosis can quite often lead to marginalisation for a person as traditional mental health will not see it as an mental illness, and it is seen as particularly resistant to treatment. Dialectic Behaviour Therapy has been proven to be quite effective however with BPD sufferers, and I would suggest looking into that. And for yourself and your mother, self care is the key. If you aren't looking after yourselves you won't be able to deal with her and in fact  situations may escalate because you or mum are not coping,leading to her feeling invalidated, and the cycle continues until thinks get bad enough that she self injures or ends up in mental health for a short stay. If you like, send me a private message and I can give you some resources or maybe help you navigate supports in your local area, although I'm probably not in the same country as you, there is internet and maybe I can help you decipher stuff? </TEXT>

In the morning I googled and found that it was in fact an old folk tradition from where he was born and that a candle lit would guide the dead to you. I had my sister carry the candle and it was with us the entire day, burning out only when the guests left. 

One other idea I saw that I really liked at a wedding was that they had a moon ornament with the deceased fathers face printed on it, so he was the man in the moon, and all the guests had their photos taken with it. Whatever you choose I'm sure will be perfect for you, and may your fathers spirit ever rise to the magic of eternity. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like I have to defend Freud a little bit as a lot of his theories were taken out of context or ridiculed by other physicians and analysts because it didn't fit the popular thinking of the time. He also was the first person to hypothesise that trauma, such as that suffered from sexual abuse or neglect could be a major contributing factor in a number of behavioural and psychological issues, and that exploring this might be helpful for his patients. Whereas his contemporaries at the time were arguing that it was the fragile female mind, hysteria etc and performing drastic and pointless surgeries to cure hysteria.

Now I'm also aware that he was a massive coke addict, and this may have something to do with his wackier theories, but I'll always have a soft spot for old Sigmund for realising something so simple that could be so intrinsic in a person's journey of healing that we have still to fully grasp and recognise today. </TEXT>

Currently we're in a major slump and have only been intimate about five times this year so far, some of those have been quickies and I have found them deeply unsatisfying, I never orgasm in that amount of time, it makes me feel unattractive, unlovable and like I'm simply a convenient hole.

There's this really great website omgyes.com where real women show their techniques, it's a pay site tho, around $30 for membership and I'm guessing you are quite young so you might not want to pay or have the money. But I used to have the same issue as you and then tried some of the methods I saw in the site and had my first solo manual orgasm in my thirties (had always used a vibe) and it was awesome, so much more intense. I've recommended it to friends since the and they have all had good experiences.  </TEXT>

Edit #2: cottage cheese like discharge may = yeast infection. Now at times of the cycle when the natural vaginal lubrication is thicker adding friction can stir things up a teeny bit, but it should never look like cottage cheese, if it does, there's a problem.

Another thing that may be contributing to it is your pelvic floor strength if you are quite active, I find myself becoming aroused to the point of almost orgasm when I do any sort of core workout or if I'm absolutely busting for the bathroom.

<TEXT> A woman's lubrication changes during her monthly cycle, before ovulation it can be creamier, whiter and thicker, sometimes gel like. Another poster mentioned cottage cheese, this is incorrect, that would indicate a yeast infection. During ovulation the lubrication becomes clearer and wetter. I'd say that your lady friend was very turned on and it was early in her cycle before ovulation. Some ladies might have a lot more wetness around the time that they cum, some might not. The lubrication isn't any indication of wether a woman has orgasmed as it would be with a man. If you want to know if she had cum, pay attention to her body, her reactions, even ask her. But if she does cum, I'm pretty sure you'll know. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Feeling constantly aroused is fairly normal for any 17yo regardless of gender, the fact that you're feeling it more when you are anxious or worried is also normal. Anxiety can cause muscular contractions in the pelvic floor, some people experience this as cramps, stomach ache or diaoreah. Some experience it as butterflies in the stomach, a tickling in the genitals or feeling of arousal. If it troubles you excessively please seek advice from a medical professional. I really think you'll be fine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I my experience this is true, but it should have read that the threat of death is incredibly high in relationships with intimate partner violence and the violence is almost always ramped up if the woman attempts to leave. The threat of death to women and children increases when the relationship ends. Along with emotional abuse and financial abuse, threats to children, this is why so many women don't leave. The ultimate conclusion to a violent controlling relationship is death, services try incredibly hard to avoid this, but still, seeing as though one woman per week is killed by an intimate partner, you can maybe understand my exaggeration. It's quite terrifying and OP's friend needs to be very careful, particularly since this man has already viciously killed her dog. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my country, one woman per week dies as a result of intimate partner violence. I work in community services and social justice and have first hand experience in just how dangerous it is for a woman to leave a violent partner. Often the violence is stepped up when the woman attempts to leave which is why women return to the relationship, very often when she leaves for good this results in the death of the woman and quite often children also lose their lives.

When I read stories like yours I realise that I never stopped grieving. But I see the stages of grief as a semi-circle, not a circle or a straight line, and me as a pendulum, the grieving process is not one you go through but one you absorb I think, and you may swing back an forth between the stages, many times, and that's normal. I'm so sorry, I don't know what to say. Honour her memory, make her proud, know she loved you. May her spirit ever rise to the magic of eternity. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not as simple as that, I think it's quite the opposite, it's cheaper and easier to mass produce cute bras in smaller sizes, so there is a glut of them on the market. It tricks consumers into thinking the department store has a huge variety. It also feeds into the sexualisation of youth and younger girls that the sexiest bras are in the tiniest sizes.

Larger sizes (anything over a D cup) require a bit more technical know how and a lot more fabric. Add that to the fact that traditionally those big boobs are supposed to belong to lactating mums or older women who society decides shouldn't want to feel sexy anymore and that's how you get the matronly, no-frills plain black/white/beige bras in the big mama section in the department store. Add to that most of the bras in this section have large band sizes to go with your cup sizes, so if you have F cup boobs the company assumes you also must have a 16-24 size body, it's ridiculously hard to find bras with smaller band sizes and larger cup sizes. It's impossible to find a 12F-G cup.

There are "big and tall" or specialist size bra shops where they make the larger sizes and mastectomy bras in the pretty fabrics, I have to travel 2hours to get to my closest one. I can order online but really I need to try on in the store to get the right fit. Walking around in the wrong size bra is as bad as wearing the wrong size shoe. And, because this is a specialist store, the exclusivity of the product is reflected in the price. I can expect to pay between $60-$120 AU for a bra in my size from the specialist store, where in a department store I might be able to get 3 for $20 AU if I had smaller cups. </TEXT>

All of these can lead to a lowered libido, and there are many other factors besides. Stress isn't the only factor to consider.

<TEXT> That's a slippery slope argument. It's illegal to abuse a child, it is just as illegal to film the abuse of a child, it is still just as illegal to consume media that depicts the abuse of a child. In my country, and also in the UK. Beside the fact that the television studio that aired this and every viewer would be complicit in the act of child abuse. Your point was???

This has nothing to do with showing the dangers of radical beliefs and everything to do with using the abuse of a child to generate income for corrupt television employees. </TEXT>

It's a slippery slope when you begin using these types of examples because they are so few, and examples of men fucking women without their consent are so so great.

Also, the reason that mother made that decision was because there were men who were willing consumers. This doesn't prove a damn thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My only advice is to never ever make her feel ashamed about her sexuality and to be clear when communicating that you do or do not want to have sex. And to be free with the cuddles and fondling on days and nights when you don't want to fuck. A lot of the time a person might just want physical closeness, but the partner will think they want to fuck, because they usually do and because they aren't into it they will physically push their lover away. That kind of rejection becomes soul destroying after a decade or so. </TEXT>

In the era I grew up in we were supposed to have already been emancipated, but we were also brought up to be sugar and spice and all things nice, not to be loud or make a scene. And we were told "boys will be boys" I think that's why for so long I haven't even thought about the things men have done to me as assault. When I was a kid, the boy next door used to hold me down and pee on me while I was playing with his sisters.

<TEXT> I grew up through the 80s and 90s and back then gaming was "fun for the whole family" like for reals, me, mum, dad, my sister and cousins, we would all have a go on the Spectravideo or the Commodore 64. I could seriously beat my dads high scores on Duke Nukem 3D. My mind just boggles at the idea that gaming is just for men, what does that mean for all of us old gamer chicks who can clearly whip their asses? How did gaming become so segregated? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was recently in a NSW Ombudsman training and the trainer who was an ex-lawyer said that it was because traditionally and culturally the term rape has described the sexual assault of women by men, and because sexual assault is never so simple as that, a more encompassing legal terminology needed to be devised. The new/current definition is much more robust. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can define rape. The definition of rape or sexual assault used in NSW: Rape is a term used in the community which describes the forced penetration of the vagina or anus of any person with any part of the body of another person, or any object, against their will or consent.  It also includes oral sex. In NSW Criminal Law, the term rape is no longer used. It has been replaced by the unisex term, sexual intercourse without consent.

<TEXT> Unfortunately in our society we tend to see crying as a sign of weakness and we are scared of big emotions. It's natural to be emotional at certain times of your cycle when hormone levels change, although socially this has become something of a joke, a way of denigrating women and putting them down "She must be on her period" because of patriarchal ideals. It's actually the opposite, crying is a sign that you are emotionally well connected, feel empathy for others, feel strongly about things. Instead of trying to figure out how to stifle your emotions, maybe figure out ways to be more comfortable with them and to care less what our society thinks about them? Just a thought - I work in the human services industry so emotions are welcomed in my workplace, I'm not sure how things would pan out if I worked in finance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In Freud's defence, he was the first psychoanalyst to suggest that trauma could be a precipitating and maintaining factor in psychological disorders (being sexually abused as a child might be why this person is having trouble sleeping and maintaining personal relationships, not the fact they have a vagina) and came up with his talking cure in a time when doctors were performing surgery on women's noses to deal with their "hysteria". It was just that at the time this was a really way out concept and he was ridiculed for it. Then he came up with all the wacky ideas (Oedipus complex, penis envy et al.) and got a wicked cocaine habit. Neurobiology is currently proving what he originally suspected, that complex trauma actually changes the brain and causes all manner of behavioural and adjustment issues. His talking cure might not be the best  treatment for issues relating to trauma, but props to him for considering it in the first place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok so one time I was sharing a hotel room with my friends. There was only one key so we had to leave the door on the latch. I had been out shopping and was super hung over so I came back for a shower and a nap and walked in on my friends having sex. Like legs in the air super passionate sex. I was mortified and closed the door super quick and they were like "Desire, are you just running in to get something? We can stop for a bit" and I was like "Nah, I just need a shower" they told me to run through real quick. I had the longest shower of my life, singing loudly the whole time, I mean like a 30min shower and at the end when I turned off the faucet, I heard my friend shout out "5 more minutes!" So I turned the water back on and sat in the bathtub brushing my teeth for a further 20mins. Afterwards my friend apologised for the awkwardness and when her BF went out to go drinking with his mates, she ordered us some pizza and wings and got some wine, then confided in me that she still didn't finish. I went to sleep with my fingers in my ear just in case she decided to go solo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not true, bellydance comes from dances performed by men and women in and around the Middle East and Mediterranean at social gatherings. The women's dances are thought to derive from ancient birthing practices, pre and post natal exercises to strengthen the body and the men's from combative practice. It's true that the dance does condition your abdominal muscles and pelvic floor, which is good for sex, but also good for avoiding prolapse after giving birth, helps correct your posture, helps with breathing and all the isolated movements are good for your brain. 

It was westerners who sexualised the dance by depicting it as risqu in art, cinema and popular culture. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If he attempts to address this non issue in front of your co-workers it would definitely be classed as bullying and harassment. In my country gender based discrimination is seriously frowned upon and can get employers into a lot of hot water. 

Personally if an employer brought this up with me in an open forum such as a team meeting, I would tell them that I would be more than happy to discuss the non issue with them further, but not in a public forum such as a staff meeting. And I would request that the union delegate be present for support. Then I would report my concerns to my supervisor's manager, and further up the chain, seek advice from HR until I got satisfaction.

<TEXT> Watch the television series Outlander, it's about four eps into the second season and the first season is out on DVD. It is awesome, romantic and quite explicit. Great sex scenes that really cater to the female gaze. It's also generally pretty great, you'll both enjoy it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a red herring but yes, I'd probably be offended if you referred to me as a "female" even knowing its your standard vernacular. I get offended when shop assistants address me with "Are you right there" instead of "Hello how can I help you" even though I know that the former is a standard greeting for young Australian people these days. I find it impolite, impersonal and offensive. As I do being referred to as a female. I'm a woman. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would be worried that this behaviour might be Jane acting out something that has been done to her.

Edit: I see I'm being downvoted, that's cool, but I just wanted to clarify that this is not armchair psychology, I'm a behaviour analyst and work with children who have experienced trauma. Sexual exploration in childhood is normal and healthy, but when the child is aggressive, persistent or repetitive it can very often indicate that child is acting out something. If I didn't consider it in the realm of possibility and keep it in the back of my mind I wouldn't be a responsible clinician.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So this one day I was on a day off and vacuuming in an old shirt of my husband's and g-string (thong for those in the northern hemisphere) I was bending over to get under the lounge when there was a knock at the door....at this point my anxiety rose exponentially, because you see we had, at that time, sliding glass doors, and whoever it was had a rare view of my most southern parts.

I rose and turned demurely, pulling the shirt down frantically and answered, "Yes"
The lady payed no attention to my discomfort and proceeded to attempt to be invited in so that she could give me a copy of The Watchtower and tell me how I should change religions, because whatever I was wasn't the right one. I very badly handled the situation due to aforementioned near nudity and anxiety, and she left muttering about how rude I was.

Flash forward around 9 years. I knock on a door on my business to meet a client I would be supporting (Desperately needed for support) Guess who answered the door? </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was young and first discovering sex, Brazilians weren't a thing, so because of pubes covering everything up I never knew that my long labia were different to anyone else's. I sexed and forplayed with my BF with abandon, face sitting, 69 everything. I had loads of fun. It wasn't until I tried shaving and I started looking at porn (long labias are censored in porn in my country) that I started to get crippling insecurity over my long labia. Only in my 30s have I started to let go of those silly insecurities and love my lovely lips again. I feel like the culture of plastic surgery has a hell of a lot to answer for, women have been born with different size and shaped lips for centuries, it's totally nothing to worry about. Just have sex and have fun!

One position that I love is a sideways 69 that works up to face sitting, we will be eating for two and suddenly he will pull me up on top. So sexy, maybe you could try that? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The word does get misused a fair bit these days but when we talk about individuals who use behaviours of concern we talk about triggers and function. As in what was the antecedent that triggered the individual to use the behaviour and what function does the behaviour serve for the individual, as in, what are they trying to communicate by using the behaviour. 

At any rate, I feel like laying OP off is an ineffective behaviour intervention, it doesn't help the individual to learn alternative behaviour and just sets them up for further failure, a worse reputation. But it's a fine line when your safety is at stake OP. Organisations have to look after their staff. It's just a really sucky situation OP and I hope you find another opportunity soon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The longer you let co-sleeping go on the harder it is to break the habit. Had you both worked together earlier to get him sleeping in his own room, the whole traumatic experience could have been avoided. I know there are many reasons for parents co-sleeping with their child, including cultural ones, so no judgement from me. But in my job I often come across parents who have allowed their children who have autism or intellectual disability co-sleep with them well into their late teens, and only start to see it as a problem when they are all outgrowing the bed. Those situations are almost impossible to deal with.

You are right to be annoyed, your husbands way of dealing with it leaves a lot to be desired, but it sounds like you weren't working together to fix the issue either. Now that he is sleeping on his own, can you see the benefit? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have only ever been able to orgasm using a vibe, or with a partner but recently after reading many posts in r/sex I decided I needed to work on making myself cum with just my hands, I felt like I had missed that step along the way and wanted to experience it. I also felt like as I get older it's becoming harder for me to achieve orgasm with a vibe and with my partner, so I thought I might need to work at it a bit and re-train my brain and body and find out what I had missed.

I heard about https://www.omgyes.com on r/chickflixxx and decided to check it out. It's a pay site, but fairly cheap, there are instructional videos and descriptions, an interactive component to the app and I got some great ideas to try. In the past few months I've been able to bring myself to orgasm, really intense orgasm, three times. I feel like I can transfer the techniques to sex with my partner and teach him the new ways that work for me as I am maturing. I don't know if it will work for everyone but it worked for me. </TEXT>

This wasn't my intention but may have to do with the utterly shit day I had yesterday, the beers I had to try and feel better and the fact that I've been attacked by Internet strangers for my beliefs before under the guise of curiosity. 

Suffice it to say, my beliefs have more to do with my cultural background and identity than with the crazy Neo-pagan stereotype but because I've been attacked before by people on the Internet who have called me crazy, pointed out the holes in the beliefs that are part of my cultural identity and tried to convince me that Jesus is the only way, I'm just not comfortable sharing anything else. Once bitten, twice shy.

<TEXT> Ok. Yes there are a fair few people who are sanctimonious about their paganism, there are those like me who love and respect the earth and the connectedness of humans and nature. 

There are a fair few people who get all mystical and sanctimonious about Jesus as well. I left the hospital this arvo and went down to the train station and saw a lady handing out flyers with a picture of a young man on life support wit the caption "Why do bad things happen to good people?" I get confused over which is more harmful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, I think I was being a bit of a brat saying not to get a puppy. I'm just hurting really bad right now, and the decision to let him try and fight or have him put to sleep is really really tough.

But all the years I've had with him following at my heel like my shadow have been the best of my life. I dreamt about him before I met him, and when I first saw him I knew he was my dog. We've been through so much together, he even once protected me from a man who was trying to break into my home when I was home alone. He attacked a man who snuck up on me in a deserted back lane. He has protected my dreams and my waking life and been with me on many adventures both in reality and imagination. I would recommend to anyone who has the capacity and the space and the love to get a puppy, put in the effort to train them and be honoured to have them as your companion for the short time that they can be. </TEXT>

Edit: just because of course I was being facetious with that. It hurts real bad right now but I wouldn't swap my little prince and all the years he's been with me for anything. Get a puppy, but be warned, a huge chunk of your heart will be devoted to them and you will lose that chunk when they go.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a behaviour analyst working with individuals with disability, mental illness, trauma. For the most part my office is really casual, mainly women and loads of them wear dresses or even shorts. I do a lot of clinical observations in the field, which means pants are best, as sometimes I need to make a quick getaway. But even on my office days I feel I need to wear pants as with most professions a lot of the management are male and I am often called into meetings where I have to defend my clinical opinion against what they think will work best financially. I just feel like in a dress they might take me less seriously.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would have to beg to differ, I can make myself come, in a variety of ways, but saying that a one partner does not and can not induce another partner to orgasm is ridiculous. Of course one partner can't take all of the credit, there has to be a certain amount of relaxation and willingness from the other partner. But saying that the partner, in this case male, is irrelevant, completely disregards the beauty of being together as a couple and reading each other's needs and wants and desires. In this case OP was able to help his lady achieve bliss. Please don't discount him. That's bad feminism. </TEXT>

Any busker, particularly if they had a didgeridoo, would become our disco, and the dancing would commence. I also remember the other tourists and people watching would then distance themselves or move along. One day though, the guy playing the didge gets up and yells, "Come on people! Get down and dance like this beautiful little family here, they know what it's all about. Deadly!!" and then it happened, everyone was accepting and dancing with us! To this day, when I see a busker I still get in there and dance my heart out like that lady! I don't care if anyone is judging. </TEXT>

And yes we have gone down the road of thinking we just weren't meant to be together, we broke up, a few times, but even on the other side of the world every road led back to each other. It's weird isn't it?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bringing up your idea for a Men's day event when you're currently organising the Women's day event may have been where you went wrong. It kind of seems like you're trying to make it about you - also, in light of the events that RooshV dickhead has been running I could see how it might not go over well.

Seriously, you don't need to be co-chair of a board to run an event, if you organised a feminist Men's day event that celebrated Men's role in birth, parenting, family and community life, social advocacy, social justice, celebrated cultural diversity, indigenous men and those with a disability then I would be there in a heartbeat. But not if its just going to be about wars, sports and prime ministers. We have more than enough statues, history books, street names and holidays that celebrate that stuff already. Best of luck to you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep. I do nice things and I like cuddles without the expectation of sex. I don't always want sex, everything you've described is what I do now so the pressure is well and truly off. And when I think we are in a good place and I might try to initiate again, or even just cuddle a bit more passionately, I get rejected and spend the next week feeling horrible about myself. When he does initiate, probably 1-2 times a month, the sex is fantastic, and I can take care of things myself for the most part. It's not that I need sex for my emotional and mental wellbeing, more that I need to be validated at least once in a while, that I am a desirable, beautiful human being. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your partner is a very lucky person. It feels like rejection is my SO's default when it comes to me. It doesn't mean I stop trying normally, but that time, after 6 months of rejection it was just too much. It was so surprising not trying anymore got such a huge reaction from him, when if I try to discuss his lack of reciprocation, I'm always told I'm overreacting. It's an ongoing battle. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's normal. I always find it best to remember that when it comes to human beings normal is a relative concept. Also when something seems different on our bodies we tend to feel it as much bigger than it really is. 3 inches may be a slight exaggeration, but really I wouldn't think much of it, 3 inches would be well within the spectrum of normal in my experience. I've seen a huge variety of nude people due to my work, but most others haven't had that opportunity, you can now thanks to the Internet.

<TEXT> This is a really interesting question. I'm not a man but I have had an experience similar to this. I'm HL my male SO is LL. Sex doesn't happen unless he initiates it. Period. It used to, but now it doesn't no matter how I try or how much I desire him. He freezes, and rolls over to sleep. 
At one point after 6 months of no sex I decided that I would give up attempting to initiate at all, this went on for three months with no comment from him. Finally he confronted me and accused me of sleeping with my best friend, even inventing "evidence" that this occurred. This almost broke us up. 
I find it really interesting that the comments so far seem to be saying that they would dump a HL female partner if they stopped attempting to initiate. What gives guys?? If you aren't going to give it, why be so drastic when we stop trying to get it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let me tell you, once I went into a job interview and the main woman interviewing said the same thing and then went on to quiz me relentlessly on the selection criteria I had previously answered. They didn't even get to the interview questions. At the end she said she was impressed with my answers and believed I could preform the role. I didn't get the job, but a week or so later I did get another job which essentially put me in a superior position to her, in an organisation that funds the one she works for and I have cause to visit her office often. It feels good to rub it in.

<TEXT> He sounds like a keeper. I had serious doubts as a child about what my gender was. I didn't grow long hair until I was about 6, and I hung around my dad more than my mum who worked shifts. I would more often than not choose pants over dresses. People would always say "What a cute little boy!" Kids at school said I had boy hair so I must be a boy, and even at dance class, the older kids said that I was a boy because my leotard was yellow and not pink. For the longest time I wondered if I really was a boy and nobody had the guts to tell me. 

Edit: Now I think of it, my male cousin used to have longer and more curly hair and lighter skin. He was always called a "Pretty girl" He also used to wear my dresses when he came over and we would play princesses together. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's good that you are seeing a therapist, but don't be hard on yourself about stopping your behaviour before you do. Behaviour change takes around 6 weeks of consistently doing things differently. 

No judgement on your lifestyle, it's not for everyone, but the fact that you are recognising that it is becoming out of control indicates that you may need to do something about it before it gets out of hand. 

All behaviour of concern is a reaction to a perceived lack of control, finding what it is you feel you've lost control of will help you understand the function of the behaviour and give you better ideas about how to curb it. All the best </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's all so ingrained that people don't even realise they're saying things that are so hurtful.

My best friend (a guy) once said to me (drunk) "Big boobs aren't attractive Desire"
I just sat there, incredulous, mouth open. "Um, what?". "Big boobs are overrated, they're what's in porn, but real bodies are what is really attractive. More than a handful is a waste" I turned to my SO and said, "Is he for real?", SO just shakes his head and says "Think about what you're saying and who you're saying it to". Bestie was mystified, until he caught me giving him the evil eye. "Are you saying that my breasts are unattractive, are you insulting SO's taste in women? I have big boobs mate" Then he back-pedalled, he wasn't talking about me in particular. I think this is one of his lines that he gives to girls when he's out trying to pick up, but he had never thought before how hurtful that could be, not only to me or other large breasted women, but to all women, as by doing so you're playing one woman off against another by the virtue of their bodies, something they can do nothing about. He is better educated now, and also slightly afraid of me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh no don't do that. I don't think they're terrible. They are just products of their environment, breasts have been overtly sexualised in popular media over the past 50 or more years. This kind of attitude is culturally mediated, TV shows and movies and particularly ads, that turn breasts into these objects of desire and ridicule. I see my mum telling me to "put them away" as a form of protecting me from sexual harassment or ridicule. Sort of like saying, "Don't go out wearing that, you know boys are only after one thing" which is wrong and counter productive, and she doesn't say it very sensitively, but she's also a product of her generation.

You can however point that firehouse at any and all men who think they have the right to harass me in the streets. And fill that firehouse with baked beans, or Sulfur water or something equally disgusting. </TEXT>

Also get him to reach up and hold your hands and steady you so you can bounce on him, bonus points if he can thrust at the same time. I have always been a bigger girl but I recently became a lot bigger because of an injury and not being able to train as hard and I'm feeling a lot less confident as a result. But walking is helping, both just out in the community and doing HIIT walking at incline on the tready at the gym have helped somewhat with the muscle tone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I realised recently that I have major anxiety about my breasts because they have always been the first thing that anyone ever comments on. I'm a 34F. The My mum was always telling me that they were "hanging out", men are always demanding that I show my tits to them, my friends are always saying "wow look at those tits" and asking to touch them, people are always saying "Oh Desire and her boobs", people automatically assume that I love the power they have over others and that I use them to get ahead in life, they've become this ridiculous joke to everyone. I really love and cherish them because of how they feel, not because of how they look to others. 

On my sisters wedding day my mum had bought us all matching dressing gowns but said "Sorry Desire, I could only get this size, hope it fits"  It fit my waist and hips perfectly, but my tits, were "hanging out" and my sis wanted to have photos of all the bridesmaids in these robes. I proceeded to have a full on and very embarrassing anxiety attack, because I was thinking of the years of ridicule to come she family looked at the wedding album, "Look at Desire with her tits hanging out, she just loves getting those tits out." My sis was the only one who understood, while everyone else was saying "what's wrong what's wrong" which doesn't help.  But my sis set up a few shots where my boobs were hidden by the other maids. 

It sucks that our body parts are always under such scrutiny.  </TEXT>

There were two mothers who brought their kids to see it. At some points the youngest kid was crying. Parents need to take some responsibility and understand their kids brains aren't fully developed and that they haven't had the life experience to actually get this type of film.

In comparison when I saw Deadpool there was an elderly couple siting in front of us and they laughed and laughed. The woman was particularly tickled by the face sitting joke.

Like if I was in prison I would want him to be watching me, he had morals and scruples. He was also built like a brick shit house.

So these two suits show up, and proceed to get drunk and play us at doubles pool. After a few games and they still weren't winning they decided to give up and move on. I was like, "Seeya guys, better luck next time" to which one of them replied, "Nice tits, shame about your fat arse" 

My mate, grabbed him by the collar and held him off the floor against the wall and told him to "Never, ever speak to a woman in such a disgraceful way" and that women are not prices of meat strewn about for their consumption. They hightailed it out of there. It was glorious to watch. When I told him he didn't need to do that, he said yes, he did have to do that, because he had sisters and a mother he loved and respected. He was a great guy. </TEXT>

It's desire. That beautiful itchy, sexy feeling. It is only desire. There is a definite difference between having thrush or a UTI and desiring penetration. Although one could be described as an itch or burning, the other would be an ache, yearning, itchy feeling. You know your own body, you decide. Good luck and enjoy your sexuality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, if anything, each time I try it I perfect it. My orgasms have always been quite intense, when I lost my virginity I couldn't even move for a couple of minutes, but they are definitely improving with age.

I definitely fantasise a lot, and that helps up the intensity and excitement that leads to those mind blowing orgasms. I still find it a lot more difficult to come from rubbing myself as opposed to using a vibe, having my husband help out or PIV, but the more I do it the better I'm getting at it. It's still pretty intense every time. I thought that OMGyes was a really good resource.

Edit: I just thought I'd add, I masturbate a lot compared to my female friends. I feel like I have a much higher libido than most women. I'm not sure if that would affect orgasm intensity? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I bought the season pass and watched all the videos. It gave me a few ideas, I had never been able to make myself come using my hands, although I can if I have help from my husband but I have always used a vibrator to masturbate.

After watching the OMGyes videos I set out to teach myself and shortly afterwards had my first orgasm solo from just clit stimulation. It was intense man. I think I hyperventilated because I saw stars. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I want to comment again, just to say how beautiful an orgasm is when only from nipple/breast play! Particularly when your counterpart is obsessed with the boobs. Just be so in love with the breast, and use your gorgeous big hands and mouth to caress and love the boobies. It's the most intense pleasure for a person who has sensitive breasts. Get in there! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The seam underneath the breast, where your breast meets your chest is an incredibly sensitive place, but is so often forgotten in breast play. Run your fingers so lightly and tenderly along this place while sucking deeply and gently on the nipple.

And also being held from behind and both breast in his hands, stimulating both nipples at the same time whilst being held tightly and him grinding against me.

The best is those tender touches, often first thing in the morning. To see a huge man's hand cupping and tickling your breast so gently, and to feel it, it's heaven and I can cum that way easily. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess the first time you screwed up was lying about watching porn, why should you have to lie about that?
It seems to me like she is overreacting to the porn, I'm a woman and I watch porn, I don't have a problem with a lot of it as long as it isn't degrading to the people performing.

But I think this is the tip of the iceberg, if she feels that you don't make her feel beautiful or desired then catching you watching porn would be a bit of a slap in the face to her. As if you would prefer to fantasise about other women than live out your fantasies with her and make her fantasies come true. Not to mention you pretty much lied to her (although I get why you would have its a pretty personal thing) I guess you may have a bit of work to do there, but she might need to as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like what you're asking here is how to get used to the idea of the act, and the way you brought up escorts, makes me think that your views of sex are really impersonal. As if penetration is the be all and end all of sex and the o my thing that's worth doing. But the thing is that it's not at all about the act itself, when you are in love or incredibly attracted to someone, you don't need to "get used to the idea" of penetrative sex with them, you desire them, you desire their company, their voice, their conversation and intelligence, the way they walk and carry themselves, the funny way they laugh or awkwardly snort. You desire them so much that everything else falls away until there is nothing but the desire to be with them, to hold them and feel their skin on yours, to touch the places that they let nobody else touch, to make them sigh and giggle and moan and then finally to be penetrated or engulfed by them. We are so much more than just walking genitals. If you overthink things, it will be terrible and awkward and unenjoyable, but if you live in the moment and allow yourself to let go, relax and enjoy the intimacy of another person's company it will all just happen, naturally, the way it is supposed to with your lover.

I get why you feel that you would just talk with an escort if you paid for one, because that is the more important part of sexuality, the talking, the connecting and the fantasising. My advice would be to stop focussing on the act itself and thinking of women as vaginas with bodies attached and just get to know some great people, eventually you will
meet a person that you click with on an intellectual level, and everything else will follow. </TEXT>

I'm on the sensitive side, I love to be caressed gently, then firmly, pinch the nipples and then soothe them. Kiss her neck and chest, nibble her ears and then kiss down the breast to take her nipple in your mouth and suck, deeply, but not hard, don't give her a nipple hickey. Bite her nipple gently. Take both breasts in your hands and push your face between them and just breathe. Alternate with kissing her neck or fingering her at the same time. You might just make her cum. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep, you're right, I was being a bit simplistic due to being drunk. But what I meant was that the potential to be either sex is there until the gonadal tissue descends and forms testes or stays and forms ovaries then all the rest follows. I guess that as this is the case, perhaps the skenes gland and prostate started off the same way as well?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah sorry, my comment above was a little simplistic due to being drunk, but yes as the foetus starts off with the potential to be both genders, the gonadal tissue turns into ovaries in a female and testes in a male, so it may also be that the skenes gland and prostate are similar. </TEXT>

Many reptiles owners may not have even noticed at all, you did good, don't punish yourself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're being down voted, but it's actually not terrible advice. I was in the UK recently and my friend told me how she went to a tanning salon to survive the winter. I baulked at it too but she then told me that tanning salons now have maximum times you can spend on a sunbed per day, like 10mins-15mins was the max. I live underneath a big hole in the ozone layer so I totally limit the time I'm out of doors, and it's recommended to not spend more than 10-15mins in the full sun, but even by default and in winter I always get a big dose of vitamin d per day, thus I absorb calcium better, my mood is great etc. I think if you have no other way to get it and you're safe about it, a sunbed could be a good alternative. There are of course supplements. But they aren't quite as effective as the real thing.

Edit: just to say that of course you should probably take all the regular precautions i.e. Wear a high SPF sunscreen when using tanning beds </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your fixation with her orgasm is making it harder for her to orgasm. The reason she orgasms so little is most probably because you are putting so much pressure on her, to the point of bringing her to tears. If you were to just have sex with no hopes or expectations for her to orgasm I bet it would happen far more often. In short get over yourself mate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look I've said this before, having sex for the first time for me (owner of a vagina) was difficult, I was tense at first so felt really tight and my BF at the time couldn't get it in. He was really sweet and cuddled me and we fell asleep and made a plan to try again the next week. But when it worked it was like ripping off a bandaid.

When we tried again, I took control, I went down on him, I initiated 69, I showed him what I liked or thought I did since I'd never tried it before. When it came to PIV, it hurt, but it didn't require any stretching, I was wet see, and the actual penetration thing, it was like ripping off a bandaid, a little fear and a little resistance and then it's done. You are so worried about it hurting because of all the bullshit you hear about it, but once it was in it was in and cue multiple orgasms. Just do the foreplay stuff and help her relax when it comes to the deed. By all means finger her, not for any clinical type stretching purpose but because it's fun for you to pleasure her and get her nice and wet and help her orgasm. The hymen is actually meant to tear. </TEXT>

People are so used to having you around they don't grasp the enormity of your moving away but then the reality sinks in that they're not gonna see you for a really really long time and then they panic, and guilt you, because of course it's your fault they're pikers.

<TEXT> Exactly, we love big brother right? 

I still fail to see how it's related, the recommendations of the board were in relation to film where the participants appear to be underage. OP didn't say she was attracted to underage boys, she said she was attracted to of-age men who aren't showing the outwards signs of masculinisation (like a beard for example). I don't see that there's any comparison since of-age women typically don't change an awful lot between the end of puberty and first pregnancy. A lot of people are saying that if a guy had a similar preference he would be a social pariah, but how many elderly millionaires do you see marrying girls a third their age?  It's not a strong argument. </TEXT>

The board supposedly represents the cannon of good taste but in reality is ridiculously conservative, paternalistic and not at all representative of our tastes as individuals. Generally there is a lot of protest when the board decides to ban or censor a film or video game.

<TEXT> I don't have any real experience with this but my take on it is that it's about the "daddy" being a more knowledgeable, bigger, more experienced and safe figure guiding the smaller person through their exploration of their own sexuality? I might be wrong, and I could get into psychology and attachment stuff, but that's how I've always seen it without having experienced it. I haven't ever thought it was in any way incestuous, but more like someone guiding another person.

Boom, I saw stars, my hands and feet were numb and tingly. Then I lost it, probably with a lack of opportunity but the next time after that I was probably 21, I was on top facing him, in an almost back bend position with my hands on his knees, grinding, but with him thrusting and bouncing me, he hardened and tightened as he was about to go and it obvs rubbed the right place, and boom, I was in full backbend before I knew where I was, seeing stars again and not able to feel my extremities. He was gracious about the backbend part, but I think it may have been slightly uncomfortable. </TEXT>

He's also not big on romantic gestures or PDAs. But he does a lot of other things to show his love for me, like household chores and buying me tickets to concerts I want to go to.

<TEXT> The hole near the top would be smaller, that's your urethra, that's where the urine comes out when you wee. The one near the bottom of your vulva is your vaginal opening.  That's where you would put your finger if you wanted to.

Most women will also rub their clitoris when they masturbate. That's the part at the top near the apex of the vulva, above the urethra, it's a very sensitive bud of flesh covered by a hood of skin. It feels really nice to rub this and also to insert a finger and rub inside the vaginal opening at the front. You can eventually get up a rhythm that will lead you to orgasm. But every woman and man masturbates differently so just spend some time experimenting and you should find your best way to orgasm. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reprehensible is a very loaded word. I post pictures of my Father on Facebook all the time, or share his posts that come up on my "on this day" thing, because a lot of my friends knew and loved him and its a way of keeping some part of his essence alive. To show that he was here, at least for a time, and now he is gone, but never forgotten. Its not for the likes at all, but to remind everyone what a great dude he was and that he had a great sense of humour.

I would guess that your husband is just grieving and more sensitive right now than usual, but offloading that grief on you by calling you names is not OK. Its gaslighting, its made you question your own perception and doubt yourself. He should not ascribe motive to your actions as u/raziphel says. 

I know what I would do in this situation, but I wouldn't presume to know the best way for you to handle it. Good luck and PM me if you want someone to talk to about your poor little kitty.

We have sex rather infrequently but when we do it's quite full on, and I always take this slump the next day as a sign that he is ashamed or embarrassed by our lovemaking and letting himself go. I probably feel this way because of my own hang ups related to constant rejection. I'n interested to see if anybody has solutions to this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think you need professional help. I think that these attitudes are indicative of the deeper issue that women who might think they are liberated are still heavily influenced by hegemonic ideals of femininity. Men are allowed to be as crass as they like, women can be, to a point, but when it comes to discussing what's really important like pleasure and orgasms, it's suddenly too much.

<TEXT> And that's fair enough. I guess my point was that you don't expect it from women, particularly close friends, like you do from men, so it hurts more and makes you question wether you really are a slut.

<TEXT> Oh yeah. I should probably not talk about it at all. It's not ladylike. But like I said, with these girls we are often very candid, they're all quite out there, we often talk about this stuff. So I was surprised. In more reserved circles the conversation would never have come up.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmm maybe I shouldn't put it out there anymore. But at the same time I get frustrated that I have to stay quiet about my sexuality. We were out at clubs where dudes were practically waving their dicks around and that's totally accepted. 

It wasn't as if I just out of context started telling everyone masturbation stories haha I'm o my a slight exhibitionist. It was in the context of the conversation, we were talking about how often we all have sex with our partners and how good/bad the sex is. Me and this bunch of girls are often very candid with each other. I said that I don't have sex nearly as often as I would like but that it's ok as I masturbate to keep myself sane. The question about frequency came up and I said daily, before work as I know it's the best I'm going to feel all day. It's a form of self care to me. And then the Nympho question came up. Maybe there is something wrong with me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Could very well be. I didn't feel as if I was being attacked in any way though, as if she was taking out frustrations on me. It was really that word that upset me and made me wonder, am I the only one who finds that offensive? Is that the way people really feel about someone who is open and honest about their sexuality? I would have thought that post "sex and the city" these kinds of attitudes would be old fashioned and the fact that people still feel that way makes me wonder if there really is something wrong with me - and does that mean my husband is normal and I'm not, and thus have no right to be upset with our current frequency?

<TEXT> I wouldn't worry, one time I was with some friends in a hotel room and my best friend was making out with this girl, she got up to go to the bathroom and he told me that he had blown his load already into the curtain and was like "What do I do? She was teasing me so much and I can't keep going?" So I was like "Pretend you're asleep I'll create a diversion". So when she comes out I drunkenly make her a cup of tea and tell her my life story until she climbs into bed and passes out. Cause that's what friends do. She told him the next day that she knew but just didn't know how or wether to stop right then as she was a bit inexperienced and didn't want him to think it freaked her out. It was no big deal until he made it a big deal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Outlander, it's based on a book by Diana Gabaldon and the sex in the book is by far the most accurate portrayal I've ever read. In the television series they don't shy away from anything, there's a lot of nudity and very realistic and sensual portrayal of sex, foreplay, affection, birth and even sadism and degradation (that part is hard to watch)

I don't know your wife but I do know the books and the show have a massive female fan base who are utterly devoted to the male protagonist in the book (and TV show) so all those millions of women can't be wrong. I just like that it's a beautiful romance, but it doesn't cut off once they get into bed, or just show their silhouettes etc. if he's fingering her, well you might not see the act, but you see their reactions, or if she's going down on him or he's licking her or whatever. It's very sexy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not actually "smell" per se. The smell is the visceral thing that you can pinpoint and go "Yeah, that's it" but in reality it's pheromones that are consciously imperceptible but that you are picking up on along with the smell. And women have a much better sense of smell than men, I think evolution has done this to ensure that we have babies with those whose immune systems are compatible. But long story short, a woman may feel that something is "off" about a man's smell, but it's not the smell, just all that other information that can be picked up that way. I mean, it could be a really stinky guy, but if they're compatible he'll smell great to her. </TEXT>

I didn't get that at the time and I was frustrated and hurt from all the rejection. Now I also work full time and have a really stressful job as well, I used to commute further than him and that meant catching the same train so morning sex upped the frequency side of things, but now I'm in a closer office and it seems we real rely see each other and the frequency has dropped right off. I still get really hurt by the rejection, but I've sort of gotten used to it. I'm kind of dreading what having children and being an at home mum will do for my libido and sex life - apart from career and motherhood balance, man, being human sucks.

I said "Nothank you, but show me your dick and I may consider it" he then proceeded to unzip his pants and pull out one nut, showing me his hairy scrotum. I told him "That's not fair, is you're dick so tiny that you're embarrassed to get it out?" He then became rather upset and went on to say that I have nothing going for me and I am a loser.

I laughed and entered the venue and when he tried to follow me he was refused entry and manhandled by the bouncers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know if I would call it a fetish, but I have a real thing for European men and I'd like to have sex with a clown.

The first one is easy, I had a completely beautiful Polish man as an admirer once, he was utterly sexy, fit, passionate, infuriating and confusing. With an incredible body. Nothing ever really happened, he was such a tease (and secretly quite nervous, he didn't think I could tell) and I suppose I was nervous too (because I didn't really believe he actually liked me, I don't think of myself as particularly alluring or beautiful - so I think that discouraged him and my not reciprocating might have even hurt him a little) but he was terribly romantic and passionate both in word and action and I always find myself wondering what might have happened had I reciprocated, and fantasising about it. I now kind of have a big thing for European men as a result.

The clown thing, well it's a combination of always loving the circus, clowns and acrobats, from a very young age. And I once was the object of a Russian clown's affections (as part of his act, not in reality - a girl can hope though) I absolutely love Jimmy Stewart as Buttons the clown in "The Greatest Show on Earth" and David Bowie in the video for "Strangers when we meet" (where he isn't really a clown, but the imagery is circus-like and I LOVE Bowie) and gosh I just don't know, clowns are often so so fit, due to the physicality of their acts and acrobatics. And just such romantic archetypes. But yes I would fuck a clown, more importantly a European clown, make up and all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Call me old fashioned (I'm a woman born right in the cusp of Gen X and Gen Y) but breast enlargement still seems really way out to me. Labiaplasty freaks me the fuck out. Penis enlargement becoming commonplace? Just, please, no. Humans are beautiful and diverse just the way we are (and I have seen a lot, A LOT, of naked bodies in my time due to my work) and I just simply cannot understand why a person would mutilate themselves due to vanity. I do understand if there is a medical or functional need or if someone was born in a body that doesn't suit how they identify, but cutting bits of yourself off or pumping bits full of silicone to achieve an unachievable ideal culturally mediated by a hegemonic media and advertising. I just do not get. Sorry. I did say I was old. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Get another doctor or, seek the advice of a professional who works exclusively with drugs that effect the brain. General Practitioners rarely have any idea of different SSRIs effects or possible interactions and they will generally use a "suck it and see" process, trying one then another then another. 

These are medications that effect the function of your brain. You don't want to fuck around with your brain. Also, your brain is unique, as is everyone's, so a drug that works for me and still lets me keep my libido may not work the same for you or Joe Blow down the street. The same way that Chanel No. 5 smells wicked on my mum but smells like cat piss on me.

That's all the advice I can offer, I also used fluoxetine and other SSRIs for a few years and it screwed with my libido, but eventually found that sex was a better antidepressant than the drugs were and weaned off it and got into dance, singing and training hard. But that won't work for everybody. Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I always believed that I would meet him one day. Every time I go to Sydney I say "Oooh I wonder if we'll meet David Bowie today?" This usually confuses who ever I'm heading there with.

But it's because a group of ladies who used to lunch in a cafe/deli I used to work at once told me a story. They all worked for the Macquarie Bank, a few of them had quite high positions. So one day in the 80s they were at the Marble Bar having a liquid lunch when one of them spied a rakish younger man at the bar, and said "Hey girls, do you reckon that bloke up there looks like David Bowie?"
Dares were made and one of the ladies went up and asked him, wether he was David Bowie, or wether he just looked like him. He admitted that he was in fact David Bowie. He lived in Sydney at that time. Then my friend, pointing at the piano, asked if he would care to prove it. And he did. He gave the almost empty bar a little concert of four songs and then enjoyed free drinks for the rest of the afternoon. All the ladies said that he was a very nice young man. One said that he even got her hormones racing.

I guess I'll never meet him now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like this would send mixed signals and it would be totally unfair to remind her of nicer, passionate more connected times for the both of you, particularly since your analysis is that you are incompatible and she doesn't agree with this analysis. You guys seem to be a little hooked on each other, so if there is a chance you can get over your differences and get back together, then go for it. But if not and this is going to leave her hoping to get back together when you clearly don't want to, then I personally wouldn't go there. Less drama that way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think most women usually only come from clitoral stimulation, so nothing to worry about there. As above there's no rule that says you must come from PIV, and count yourself lucky that you actually can orgasm cause I've read that there are a lot of women who can't. I can only speak from my own experience, but I feel like when I relaxed about it all and didn't make a big deal about it, it just happened. 

It probably helped that my BF (now husband) will always get me off before PIV a few times, and then again after if I don't get there. So the pressure is well and truly off, and one day - Sploosh! Vaginal orgasm out of nowhere. I feel like when I stopped putting so much importance on it, I relaxed enough for it to happen. But it still doesn't happen often and more often than not it will happen from fingering rather than PIV. But now that I'm more relaxed (and older, I'm pretty old) I have discovered all sorts of other orgasms, nipple ones and neck kissing ones.

Edit: I misunderstood the question. I fixed that up now haha </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's your hymen. Mine was like this, waaaaay long ago in the dark ages before I lost my virginity. I guess the important thing to remember is that each woman is different, so nobody can tell you exactly what you're going to feel when you have sex for the first time. 

For me when I lost my virginity it was too tight the first time we tried it, I was a bit stressed out and my BF was fairly big, and we hadn't had any foreplay beyond some touching in the cinema. It was pretty painful as well, and his penis wouldn't go in. But he was understanding and we cuddled instead and then tried again a few days later, with lots of foreplay, (touching, kissing, BJ, cunnilingus - the whole lot) and then we had sex with me on top so that I could control things, and because I was well lubricated, he slipped right in, causing just the tiniest tear in my hymen. It was actually wonderful and one of my favourite memories ever. It hurt, but just a little bit, and after a few seconds it felt really good!

So it probably will hurt but only a little as long as you have a partner who is patient and understanding and passionate enough to want to spend a long time on foreplay, and I would also suggest using lube as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a lady in a similar situation as you, we're in about 1-2 times a month and have also found that exercise and meditation, although they help a bit, don't really give me the relief I need. 

Masturbation is great, it clears the cobwebs and I watch good porn and that gets me going but both usually make me frustrated about what I'm missing out on. I too prefer the intimacy of being with my other half and making love to him as well as getting off.

I also issues with concentration and motivation when I'm not getting any, and tried mindfulness, but I wasn't very good at that. So I've been having imagination breaks, writing mostly, or getting out in the garden with my headphones on and just letting the creative visualisation happen. It's got so that I have a bunch of characters and sometimes things get rather steamy and erotic scenes play out on the paper and in a way it's satisfying for me in that I guess my brain is my biggest sexual organ. It's still not as lovely and intimate as having sex with my husband, but I don't think anything is. At least my little imagination breaks with the characters I've made up and short erotic fiction help me remember that I've still got it.

Sorry I can't help you more, but that's what helps me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Number one top fantasy is completely  unachievable, sex with a clown. With the make up on. It can't be a scary pervert clown though, think old fashioned and sweet like Jimmy Stewart in "The Greatest Show on Earth" or romantic and rakish like David Bowie in the "Strangers when we meet" video clip. I imagine my clown would have a beautiful body beneath his baggy trousers due to all the tumbling and acrobatics he does, I imagine him as Victorian or steampunk. He would probably be European. I know there are clowns like this out there, Cirque du Soleil and various other circuses and the steampunk thing is really in right now, but unfortunately I'm married. No clown sex for me.

Apart from that my real and achievable sexual bucket list:- I would really love to be properly spanked, as a form of foreplay, rather than just a novelty. I'd like long, slow, teasing oral sex - not something that seems like a race to orgasm. I'd like to tie up a man and tease, tickle and dominate him until he can't help but orgasm and I'd like that for me as well.
