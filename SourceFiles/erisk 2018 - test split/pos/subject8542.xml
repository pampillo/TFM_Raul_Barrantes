<TEXT> I survived a severely emotionally relationship and I can confirm that gaslighting is one of the most clever, subtle, and damaging forms of abuse that there is. I have several other peers from support groups who've experienced similar circumstances, and I have yet to meet a single victim of emotional abuse who was able to realize they were being gaslit while it was happening. It's almost doing a disservice for people to continue talking about how idiotic Donald Trump is. The act of inflicting verbal abuse, reeling yourself in, and then convincing your victim that the abuse didn't happen is an incredibly calculated and intentional act; he knows exactly what he's doing, and we as the American people need to start recognizing this behavior and naming it for what it is.

<TEXT> Social Work student specializing in mental health here. There are a LOT of misconceptions about schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is actually a pretty broad term, and there are a variety of symptoms that can manifest - it doesn't mean that you are just watching around in a perpetual acid trip, despite how it's commonly portrayed.

Depression isn't always, as a particularly shitty counselor once told me, the "common cold of mental illnesses." Depression can manifest as psychosis and catatonia in severe cases - just because it is commonly recognized and widely treated does not mean that it is easy to live with, by any means. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What I think is going on w/ the increasingly blurred distinction between Elliott and his dad: it's been obvious for awhile that Elliott has dissociative identity disorder, but for the most part, he has been aware of when Mr. Robot takes over and can, to some extent, control this. 

With DID, as its severity increases and the individual undergoes higher levels of stress, it isn't uncommon for these shifts between the person's "alters" to happen without warning. It's quite common for people who have experienced extreme trauma to go long periods of time with multiple alters before they ever realize that their "true" self wasn't always present.

This is also where phrases like "out of body experience" come into play, where people with DID legitimately feel that they separate from their physical form. Some people even report "watching themselves" act and think as a completely separate person, with no control whatsoever. 

I'm guessing that as Elliott adjusts to the shitshow outside of prison, his mind is kicking into Mr. Robot without him realizing it. He's gone from a rigid and constant routine to complete unpredictability and I'd bet that this instability is only going to get worse as the season progresses.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, parking fucking sucks. I try to arrive ~30 minutes before my class, and then I just use whatever extra time to review material. 

Find lounges and other quiet spaces on campus where you can relax in between classes. My commute is 25 minutes, so I can't justify driving back-and-forth just because there's a 2-hour gap in between some of my classes. The library is great for this purpose, and it's a good time to get some homework out of the way if you're feeling particularly productive.

Finally, if you don't have a meal plan, bring your own lunch and coffee when you can. There's a burrito place and a Dunkin Donuts on my campus, and I wasted so much money my first semester. Don't fall into the habit of eating at on-campus dining just because it's convenient. The expenses will add up quickly! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Worked at Sears for about three months, which is a "weird workplace experience" in and of itself. I've worked in a couple of other retail settings, but Sears was by far the most depressing. You get very few customers, and there's this sort of unmentioned but mutual knowledge between all of the employees that the store is bound to close eventually, no matter how many promotional displays and morale-boosting materials corporate shipped over to your store. (It's been almost two years since working there and they have, indeed, closed since I left.)

But anyways, I worked in footwear. Most of the store's customers were senior citizens, so I'd get a lot of older people coming in and getting *personally* angry with me, a lowly minimum-wage salesperson, that we no longer carried their favorite pair of shoes that they purchased in the store ten years prior. Had an older man come in and start mumbling about war stories and how he refused to buy any of our footwear if it was made in Asia.

But the strangest experience had to be an older woman who came into the store and began yelling at me in Polish. I shit you not, the only phrase I could make out was "filthy American communists." She would occasionally jerk her finger towards a pair of shoes, and I tried my hardest to get past the whole yelling-in-Polish part and hand her shoes in order to appease her, and eventually she sat on a bench, tried on a pair, threw them on the ground, and then left.  </TEXT>

I finally got around to getting some bloodwork done recently, and I'll find out the results in about a week. Maybe it's worse than I thought and I need a prescribed dose?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ha! I actually recently heard about the man who lost weight eating Twinkies. If you've ever listened to "Wait, Wait...Don't Tell Me!" on NPR, they talked about him on there. 

Anyways, thank you so much for the advice. I live by myself, and so I think part of my issues also stem from not having anyone around to hold me accountable for how much I eat during meals. But I definitely like the idea of making myself cook in larger quantities and then immediately portioning them for future meals, rather than allowing myself the temptation of taking seconds (or thirds, or fourths.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, /r/loseit! I stumbled upon this subreddit after browsing Reddit for a place where I could gain advice about my particular problem, and this seemed like a great place. 

So, I'll cut right to the chase - I have been obese for nearly my entire life. I won't get into specifics, but I am currently nearly 80 pounds overweight. I am embarrassed and ashamed of how far I have allowed my weight gain to progress. I've tried quite a few different tactics, but I have a difficult time sticking to any fitness routine for more than a couple of weeks due to the fact that I have chronic fatigue and hypersomnia.

I recognize that the constant exhaustion has likely developed as a result of the weight gain itself, but it's so difficult for me to convince myself that I should take a brisk walk when I can hardly get through the day without sleeping for 12-14 hours at night. I've come to rely on (prescribed) stimulants and caffeine, but even those are only a band-aid on this constant feeling of lethargy and tiredness.

So, how do I develop a routine that I can actually stick to? Where do I start? There's something inside of me that yearns to wake up early every morning, enjoy the sunrise, exercise my body, and make it through the day without collapsing in exhaustion, but I feel so far away from that reality. I'm tired of using my fatigue as an excuse, but it often feels impossible to overcome. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Vyvanse 50mg was the first medication I ever tried. It remains my favorite. It allows for smooth focusing, a pleasant amount of energy, and has a pretty steady release throughout the day. I took it for six months and found that it remained effective throughout that time and I only built up a mild tolerance to it. Unfortunately, when I switched my insurance policy, it became too expensive.

2. Concerta was the next option. I was on 18mg per day. I do not like Concerta and would not personally recommend it, but ADHD manifests differently in everyone, and subsequently, so do its medications. I like to explain my experience with Concerta by saying that Vyvanse allowed me to pleasantly focus on one or two tasks at a given time, whereas Concerta made me feel like I needed to focus on a dozen tasks at a given time. Its release throughout the day had too harsh of a peak-and-trough effect. I have comorbid hypersomnia in addition to my ADHD, and so I also rely on stimulants to keep me awake. I was on it for two months and found that when it wasn't working, I was dead tired. When it was working, I felt nearly manic.

3. Adderall XR 20mg was the next attempt. It worked pretty well, but because of my aforementioned hypersomnia, I found that once I came down around 6-7 hours after taking it, I would abruptly burn out for the day. I was on this for only one month.

4. Aaaand finally, I'm currently on Adderall IR (immediate release) 20mg, twice a day. This seems to work pretty well for me. I take one when I wake up around 9 AM, and another around 2 PM. I still prefer Vyvanse, only because Adderall has a harsher comedown for me. I find that at the end of the day, I become very irritable. I describe it to my boyfriend as a kind of "sensory overload" feeling where I need very little stimulation, or else I'll become agitated. But it does help me to focus on a couple of major tasks at a time without feeling too overwhelmed, and it gives a nice boost of energy that I need to get out of bed in the morning and make it through class.  </TEXT>

There's actually a very popular high-end yoga clothing website that sold them for awhile. Of course, they didn't even call them mala beads, just "meditation beads." The guru bead had the clothing brand's logo on it, and they sold them for $108. They put out a statement saying that they cost $108 as a "reflection of the spiritual number."

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was raised a strict Pentecostal Christian - for roughly 15 years, it was drilled into my head that our brand of Christianity was the only true form of Christianity - all the other sects aren't good enough, aren't Christlike enough, et cetera. I stopped considering myself a Christian a few years ago, but as many of you probably know, the ideas that we are taught as children often stay with us far longer than we'd like them to.

Lately, as I'm becoming more serious about finding a Sangha and incorporating Buddhism into my everyday life, I'm having difficulty parting with this childhood mindset. I find myself jumping back and forth between the various schools, unsure of which one is the "right" one, afraid that I will pick the "wrong" practices and not be a "real" Buddhist. I know that sounds silly, but this mindset has been very difficult for me to overcome.

Did anyone else find themselves struggling with this at any point, especially those of you who come from a sectarian Christian background? Have you ever changed which school or branch you studied? How can you overcome the indecisiveness?

Answers would be much appreciated.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow, thank you! This is far more informative and thorough than I expected, and I really appreciate it.

I also have a simple rosewood Mala, and I planned on taking that one with me when I go to public services - that's the one that I often keep on my person. Unfortunately, the red stain on the beads is beginning to wear off - as I unfortunately noticed when I had it wrapped around my hand for a while last week, and then unraveled it to find a blotch of tiny red bead-shaped spots on my skin! - which is why I thought it might be nice to make my own.

To be honest, the one that I made is moreso for my own use. Crafting is a very relaxing and soothing activity for me, and so I thought that it might be nice to make one solely for use at home, hence why I used the vibrant colors and pendants. I'd never heard of the practice of keeping one for private use, and that's definitely something I'll keep in mind. 

That being said, this really is very helpful to know. I appreciate you explaining this to me. I was worried that I would be faced with condescension since I'm relatively new to Buddhism, but it's nice to be met with a genuine, informative answer. I'll be the first to admit that I often fall victim to being drawn to visual objects solely for their beauty (I partially blame my ADD, ha!) and this was a nice reminder to be mindful of seeing the underlying purpose in things that have surface-level beauty.

Thank you. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some really great recommendations here. I've also struggled with my weight for several years. I'm particularly guilty of eating large amounts in one sitting, without even being that hungry. I don't necessarily think that you need to sacrifice the pleasure of enjoying a good meal; I, too, love new foods, new recipes, interesting ingredients. I think that it's moreso about reining in the temptation to be OVER-indulgent.

It may sound silly, but I've found that trying to maintain mindfulness while eating often helps. Focus on the textures, the taste, the origins of the food, the effort it took to prepare the food, the nourishment that it will provide your body. When you grant so much attention to your food, you'll typically end up eating more slowly, and it will be much easier to recognize when you're full. There's a gap of time between eating a meal and feeling physically full, and we often eat so quickly that we don't realize how stuffed we are until we've already consumed far more than we needed.

Another recommendation: don't fall into the trap of thinking that radical, sudden changes are the key to weight loss. I've lost roughly 20 pounds in the past few months, and I did so by making small, gradual changes over a long period of time. When people decide they'd like to lose weight, we want to see drastic results in a short amount of time; such a regimen is very difficult to begin, and even harder to maintain. Establish a few small goals for yourself (x amount of water each day, x amount of sleep each night, x amount of exercise each week, etc.) and approach them one at a time, rather than trying to tackle them all at once.

Best of luck to you. :)

<TEXT> Tricycle Talks are really good if you're looking for discussion and learning that isn't too heavy. I listen to them during my morning commute, because they don't require intense focus, but they're still really interesting. 

As far as Dharma talks, Zencast is the best I've found so far. There are a few hundred episodes, too, so there's content for just about every subject and for every level of practitioner. The talks are a bit lengthier and more in-depth, so they may not be as good for "background noise" (I typically take notes when I listen to them) but I would still highly recommend. 

Hope you enjoy. :)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed. I have been interested in Buddhism for years, but I only recently began attending actual meditation services and Dharma talks. I did some research, made a list of all the centers near me that seemed appealing, then wrote down dates and times for the ones I wanted to attend. 

Keep looking around and trying different options until you find a teacher who resonates with you. Most places expect new people to drop in sporadically, so don't feel nervous about going for your first time. If you're like me and you get easily anxious about new places, call or email them ahead of time to see if there are any particular services for newcomers.

Hope you find something that feels right for you. :)

<TEXT> ^ a lot of great points here. There is a huge misconception that BPD is some kind of death sentence, and that those of us who suffer from it are doomed to a life of self-harm, mood swings, and unending feelings of abandonment. 

Personally, DBT and the habits I've developed as a result of DBT have hugely changed my life; like you said, it is indeed possible for those of us with BPD to radically change our lives. Even my family members and close friends have noticed a huge difference in my personality since beginning counseling. 

And I would agree with your statement that we don't necessarily become incredibly attached to people or things, even though it may seem that way on the surface-level. Rather, we become attached to the thoughts and feelings conjured up by that object; for instance, I don't necessarily become attached to romantic partners, but I do become attached to feelings of affection (hence why I used to recklessly date anyone who paid attention to me, regardless of what type of person they were). Fortunately, this sort of mental   emotional attachment certainly can be and IS addressed both in DBT and most Buddhist practices. 

I would say, without a doubt, that the teachings of DBT have improved my condition far more than any other treatment I've had, professional or self-improvised.

<TEXT> Update: I attended the Shambhala Center's "Intro to Meditation" session on Wednesday night. I immediately felt very comfortable in their center. There were informational books and pamphlets everywhere, all of which explained the basics of Shambhala, so I didn't feel like I was imposing on an unfamiliar space. There were people shuffling around the room from other classes, and everyone seemed very friendly. The woman working at the front desk didn't pressure me into donating a particular amount when I checked in, nor did she bat an eye when I could only give a few dollars rather than the full $10. 

The session itself was great. The teacher was very friendly, calm, and approachable. He taught us basic meditation techniques, interspersed with brief historical context. By the end of the class, everyone felt comfortable asking questions and discussing their thoughts. Nobody felt stupid for raising their hand and saying, "Hey, my foot fell asleep. Is that normal?" 

I'm planning on going to their Sunday 1-hour sitting now that I have a feel for the place. I also found out that they offer a weekly meditation and teaching session for individuals who suffer from trauma-based mental illness; as someone who suffers from PTSD, talk about a perfect fit. 

So glad that I was encouraged to look into them. :)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sort of, yes. It was actually originally called "borderline" because psychiatrists thought that people with BPD straddled the border between psychosis and neurosis, but we now know that BPD is largely caused by one's childhood environment (abusive parents, caregiver neglect, sexual trauma, you get the idea). 

For instance, I was raised in a radically pentecostal home (almost a cult; think "Jesus Camp" type of stuff). Being brought up with the belief that heaven is this supremely unattainable prize and that hell is a place of unimaginable suffering (a place where all of my friends were supposedly going, no less) caused me to think in very black-and-white terms from the time I was a toddler.

Black-and-white thinking is a hallmark symptom of BPD (hence the popular BPD book title, "I Hate You, Don't Leave Me!"), and so my own personal diagnosis of this illness can be traced back to those childhood beliefs. You get the idea.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi! I have BPD. I was formally diagnosed around 2 years ago, but have lived with its symptoms for about a decade. 

The psychiatric community is actually moving away from the "borderline" terminology; the more accurate and up-and-coming title is "emotional intensity disorder." 

Put simply, a popular metaphor to describe BPD is to imagine that we have 3rd-degree burns covering our "emotional skin," and so we are very sensitive to the world around us. We feel emotions very deeply, rapidly, and intensely; both good AND bad ones. This intensity makes the good feel VERY good (i.e., I cry when I see a cute dog) and the bad feel VERY bad (i.e., I thought I wanted to die when my 9th grade crush didn't like me back.)

Interestingly enough, dialectical behavioral therapy (the most widely-used method of treating BPD) is what really brought me to Buddhism. DBT teaches us to use mindfulness to examine these very severe emotions, so that we are better able to control them. So, it promotes mindful thinking, meditation, analyzing the inner workings of ourselves, and a lot of other habits that align with Buddhism. 

I hope this helped a bit. I am actually currently studying to be a mental health counselor, and have been in DBT therapy for over a year. Let me know if any of this does not make sense. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure if this is consistent with all of their centers, but I did some more research into the NYC branch and they offer a "generosity policy" that allows you to pay a smaller fee/no fee, if your financial circumstances otherwise prevent you from attending. And in my case, full-time volunteer work leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to income, so I'd be interested in utilizing such a policy. 

Of course, once I do find a community that seems to feel right for me, I also plan on offering volunteer work as compensation. I have professional training in photography and graphic design, so I'm hoping that I can use those skills wherever I end up.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not entirely positive, to be honest. So far, Tibetan Buddhism seems to be the best fit for me from what I know about it.

I actually tried the New Kadampa Center in NYC and really enjoyed the dharma talk, the structure of the service, the atmosphere, etc. But again, there seems to be a lot of negativity surrounding the NKT (and any other modern, Westernized Buddhist tradition, really), so I'm hesitant to commit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, everyone. So, I travel all over the United States doing volunteer and humanitarian work for a living. I've been studying Buddhism independently on and off for the past couple of years, and am starting to become serious about making it a central focus in my life. I'm stationed in New York City for the next month, and so I'm trying to take advantage of all the different resources that are available to me, but I've run into a problem: I don't know which community or temple to join, just because I travel so much. 

I know that centers like New Kadampa, Shambhala, Diamond Way, etc. are easy to find across the country, but these very large organizations don't seem to be without considerable negative controversy that I'm not sure I want to get involved in, and I don't know if I'm willing to overlook some of their more questionable politics just for the sake of convenience. 

Does anyone know of any other large groups that are easy to find throughout the country? I'm not quite sure which particular tradition I would like to study yet, so I'm open to any and all suggestion. This is my first post, and I've only recently begun to seriously look into Buddhism, so I'm still learning. </TEXT>
