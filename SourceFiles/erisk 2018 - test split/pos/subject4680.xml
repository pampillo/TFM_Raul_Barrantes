<TEXT> I think the title here is misleading. It made me think Hatch said he wants to ban native Americans from public land when he said he thinks federal control will hamper their activities. 

It's racist and ignorant anyway. Just pointing out the potential confusion.  </TEXT>

Little random lies that I try so hard not to say but end up saying anyway wreck my relationships with so many loved ones. 

Someone else mentioned it in this thread but compulsive lying can be a real problem for otherwise good people. Especially those who struggle with mental illness.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you.

I'm not sure why there aren't more theories, at least on the play. The references to mythology and other works, as well as the possible explanation for character motives, are pretty rife. Hell, I haven't even touched on the origins and nature of Bert, which could be another post entirely.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you. I'm glad you enjoyed it. 

I do like that theory. I hadn't considered it at all. I think it's one of the highlights of the play that the mystical elements intentionally draw on several aspects of world mythology simultaneously.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Mary Poppins is Hestia, Goddess of family </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-24 20:48:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My brother is in a production of Mary Poppins right now and we were debating the nature of Mary as a character. The three theories that came are, first, that the children are just imagining Mary Poppins as magical, the second is that Mary is a fairy, in the Irish folklore sense, and the third is that Mary is Hestia, Greek Goddess of the hearth and family. 

[Note: This theory is centered around the play, not the movie, although they are very similar so I think it applies to both.]

Mary clearly demonstrates magical powers in the play. She can fly and possesses the ability to control others (such as when she forces Ms. Andrews to drink the brimstone and treacle. This is also noted when the children tell her she must have put the idea to let them visit the bank into their father's head and she laughs.) She also brings the toys and statues to life, and consistently forces the children to and from sleep by snapping. 

These powers could be attributed to the imagination of the children but I would argue otherwise, considering she actually forces Ms. Andrews to both drink her tonic and leave.

When the statue of Neleus comes to life it tells the children Mary is an old friend of his father's. We later learn that his father is Poseidon, God of the sea. This would go a long way to explaining Mary's powers. I would like to think this comment means that Mary is part of the Greek pantheon, given that she knows Poseidon. But that leaves the question of which character she is. 

We know that Mary goes from broken family to broken family and mends them. This would hint at Hestia, Goddess of family. Furthermore, the symbol for Hestia is the hearth, or fireplace. The fireplace in the Banks household is not a plot point, but is mentioned multiple times and is a centerpiece of the set, at least in the original Broadway and London runs of the play. 

Furthermore, and more obviously, the image of chimneys is pretty consistent throughout the play. Bert himself is a chimney-sweep and the children, and especially Mary, spend quite a bit of time around the chimneys on the rooftops. If we're willing to accept chimneys as a substitute, imagery wise, for the fireplaces themselves, that brings even more relevance to the hearth and a further link to Hestia.  </TEXT>

Last I checked there's something like a thousand coffee shops in the city. So if you're into coffee come check us out. My favorites in particular are Barista, which has coffee from a bunch of roasters, Ristretto if you're into espresso, Stumptown is the classic and is worth trying but is not the best, and Hearts is great if you're into pretentious stuff.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> With spoiler season upon us, I've been thinking. Be careful about assumptions that certain strategies are trash and others are great. I've been playing a midrange demonlock that was posted a little while ago and I reached a higher rank in two weeks than I did in a month of playing aggro shaman before. 

Consider the fact that we, as a community, didn't really "discover" Finja water decks until late in the MSoG meta. 

All I'm saying is, try out new decks and ideas and see what works. Don't get caught up in what's meta. It limits what we can find as a community.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sort of. I kind of hate that name but yeah. 

The idea is that our culture has been absorbed by a misinterpretation of postmodernism that is mostly just about being as jaded and emotion-less as possible. Wallace's work, as well as many other contemporary authors and other artists, intentionally rebels against that with literary style and plot that is built on sincerity and emotional honesty. 

There's a lot more to it than that, but that's the heart of it.  </TEXT>

We were excited but after smoking out of it my lungs had never hurt that bad in my life. I was in so much pain and we both got really sick. Also I was so high I lost touch with reality and it was horrifying. But my question is what did we do wrong? I thought it hurt less than a pipe... it's a nice glass bong FYI, not bad materials that made us sick.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Enough depends on person to person and you'll just have to experiment. It also depends on the quality of weed. 

New York is an illegal state so beware of that. The negative effects of the illegality of it are much worse than any physical or mental effects of the drug. 

And no, it shouldn't impact your grades if you're a good student. I think a lot of people who are just bad student who don't do their work blame their lack of good grades on their smoking, at least in my experience. Just wait to relax until after your work is done. But you already know that, I'm sure. Which is my point.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love this. I feel like it could generate a crazy archetype where you use the self-harming cards to gain tempo and race to kill your self before your opponent can kill you. Sounds like it'd be insanely skill-dependent to run but it sounds fun.  </TEXT>

How can I properly clean my kettle? Or should I get a newer one since mine is very very old? Or is something else the problem? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this is quite the question. The Mormon church believes in something called the words of wisdom, which is basically a bunch of rules that say how to take care of your body. It was written during a time in which Mormon society was falling apart due to wide-spread alcoholism. This included a throw-away line that says not to consume "hot beverages", which has, in modern times, been translated as coffee and tea. I have no clue why, and I think it's absurd personally, and a violent misinterpretation of the text, but that's just me.

Sorry for the ramble but I hope it helps to make sense of it. 

Edit: Spelling. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't remember which writer but someone said the natural path to take is poetry, short stories, then novels. 

But I think the important thing is to read a lot. Learn how writers function and deliver their messages. It's important and it'll teach you a lot. And besides. Referencing other works will make your life easier because it can clue readers into what themes you're talking about. 

Sorry to ramble. But that's my advice.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Fruity Pebbles Review </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-13 08:26:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First review! Just happens to be what I'm smoking rn so I thought I'd share. 

Fruity Pebbles
Hybrid
THC 19.61%/CBD 0.06%

Flavor
Fairly tasty. It has a fairly fruity flavor that smells good and the smoke goes down pretty smoothly. 
[7/10]

Looks
I actually think this strain is really pretty. It's mostly green, but pulling it apart reveals bits of purple hidden within. Looks beautiful in my bowl. 
[8/10]

High
I liked it! The high crept up on me. I didn't realize I was getting really high until I already was, which, at least for me, made the session pretty smooth. The high made me and my SO incredibly relaxed and at ease. At first we were acting really goofy but before I knew it I was lying in bed and my muscles were so relaxed I couldn't feel them anymore. Thought it was a shockingly good high.
[8/10]

Overall
Pretty damn good, really. I bought it because I was at a dispensary and my SO got all excited about the name. I didn't expect it to be all that good but I liked it quite a bit. Would recommend. 
[8/10] </TEXT>

<TEXT> Story time. 

Not about my SO, but actually about me. On one of our first dates (I think the third) and I was freaking the fuck out because I was really into her and our previous dates had gone... Poorly. So I wanted to do this right. I tried to be romantic. I cooked her dinner with her favorite meal and she wanted to show me a movie she loves. So we ended up in my dark basement watching Silence of the Lambs. I was way too nervous to pay attention to the movie. We're cuddling up and I thought I should give her a compliment and so I turned to her, in the middle of a dialogue with Hannibal Lector, and say "You have such soft skin." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello!

It was always a passion of my family to host parties and a big part of that was bartending. My dad was an incredible bartender in his heyday and I always admired it. Now I am 21 and want to carry it on. Problem is I don't know shit about what booze to get. 

I'm a broke college kid but I've got a little money to spend. How do I maximize the amount of drinks I can make while going on a budget. If it helps at all I really love rum and my wife really loves vodka so we'd be willing to splurge for those. 

Thank you so much. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Let's make a deck together! Illusion Rogue? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-12 00:19:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys! 

I came up with an idea for a deck but i need help creating it because I know jack-dittely shit about the class I'm thinking about here.

My idea was for Illusion Rogue, or a control rogue archetype build around Violet Illusionist. Basically, the idea is to use Violet Illusionists to make your weapons into an incredibly powerful and cost-effective removal tool. Deadly Poison plus Violet Illusionist turns your dagger into a three damage removal with very little drawback.

I'm gonna be totally honest and say that I'm pretty sure this subreddit is kind of... Confused. If you look at its sidebar info, it has some ideas mixed up. Maybe a little delayed in their timeline. 

Their timeline states that Modernism was sort of the advent of seeking trough through science, but actually Modernism was a very specific break from that mentality. It rebelled against the truth-seeking Enlightenment thinkers and discussed subjectivity. For examples, see Nietzsche, Sartre, or literary examples such as Woolf or Faulkner, even Joyce, all as evidence that the Modernist movement was largely about subjectivity of truth, which the subreddit claims is the idea that Postmodernism focuses on.

If we remember way back to the Idea Channel episode on Community, we find that Postmodern is about meta-narratives, which is what most of this subreddit seems to be discussing. 

If you ask me, which you probably shouldn't because I'm just an English major whose knowledge of philosophy is mostly surface level, I'd say that post-postmodernism does exist in the world and that there are several philosophical and artistic movements rebelling against Postmodernism in the same way that Postmodernism rebelled against Modernism before it, and so on and so forth into philosophical history ad infinitum, but it seems more like this subreddit is filled with Postmodernists who are a little confused about the definition of Postmodernism.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Farmhouse </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-27 11:30:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello r/paranormal. 
I've been wanting to share my experience with the internet at large for a long while and I finally found this subreddit.

My family owns a farmhouse out in the middle of nowhere. There are two houses nearby, one of which we share a fence with. Otherwise it's just farms as far as the eye can see. 

One day extended family and all were hanging out there when we heard a scream and a gunshot. I can't be certain of what exactly went down because I was in the basement. My uncle, a veteran, ran down into the basement where I was taking care of the younger kids (I was about sixteen at the time) and told me to stay down there and away from windows. 

Me and my brother and our cousins pretty much cowered in fear in the basement until my dad came downstairs and told us it was okay to come up. There were a shitload of police officers at the house next door. Turns out the lady next door had locked her daughter in her room and held the husband at gunpoint for a few hours before she noticed her daughter escaping through the window. She shot them both and then was killed by the police. She had the highest BAC I had ever even heard of, at about 0.7 blood alcohol content. 

Nothing strange happened immediately, but the next time I went up there I noticed footprints leaving the house as I was leaving. They appeared to be that of a goat, which I thought was weird considering they went neatly up the stairs as if they had been walking on two legs. 

I put that aside as a trick of the light (which I still sort of do, tbh)

The next time my family went up there things were weirder. The entire place smelled fucking awful and there were scratch marks everywhere. I immediately assumed a cat had gotten in, but then I found handprints on the basement walls, as if someone had had their hand covered in soot and pressed it against the wall.

Furthermore, everyone there acted very uncharacteristically. My family, which usually got along very well, broke out in several fights, and one of them even got very close to getting violent. 

Any thoughts? Do you think something weird is going on? </TEXT>

<TITLE> A meaningful Yggdrasil tattoo request </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-19 03:40:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi! 

I don't mean to be annoying but I know what I want in my first tattoo but I can't draw... And I'd really like someone to try to draw this so I can see if it works at all or looks dumb. 

My idea was to get a tattoo of the Yggdrasil ash tree from celtic mythology because that symbol means several things to me on a few different. (If it would help to know those things send me a PM)

Anyway, specifically, I envision it having a natural to digital-looking progression, with the trunk (preferably a curved trunk, as is traditional with Yggdrasil tattoos) and roots being elegant and lush looking, and the branches and leaves looking more geometric and digital.

I'm sorry to be so specific but if anyone would make that, it would be fucking amazing.

Thank you so much.

Sincerely,
Splendidman </TEXT>

He is... Relatively speaking. Sadly, he's very anxious due to abuse from the owners he had before us, and so he has a habit of freaking out, although those have been getting better. 

We're not quite sure when we would need someone to look after him for a period of time, but it's possible we'll need a long-term sitter for him for nine months starting September of next year.

We've always had each other's backs, I guess, and it's just kind of naturally evolved into something a lot more than a relationship.

<TEXT> I completely agree with that. NPC wise the game is really good about it. I guess there are just a lot of lore points that are sketchy.

<TEXT> It's not universal but a lot of the female characters are portrayed as manipulative and cold. One or two characters like that is fine, IMO, but it sometimes gets a little sketchy, especially with the daughters of manus. The emerald Harold is arguably among these characters, depending on your interpretation of the lore, Licia, Mytha, etc etc etc. just a lot of cold, spiteful women who fuck shit up for men and that's the vast majority of the female representation. 

Lucatiel is cool, IMO. And the daughter of manus in the ivory king DLC goes a long way to making up for the other daughters. Although the whole prospect of her needing a man to show her morality is a little weird, but that might be reading too far into it. 

Also Rosabeth. I have no idea what the implications of being able to dress her up however you want might be, but I think it's honestly too dumb to read into.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, the two games are VERY different. 

First off, in the lore department. In DS1, the story is centered around a macro-story, without too many sub-stories besides NPCs. DS2 is the opposite, with the stories of many kingdoms being told throughout the game. The lore is more thematically based and has a stronger human element as opposed to godly forces. That being said, the story occasionally has less strong bits, and also struggles with a fair bit of sexism, if you ask me, although that's not the case with every character. Also there's some dumb "dark edginess" that's occasionally eye-roll worthy. But once again, this isn't always. 
The story is also built around themes of disappointment, degradation, and loss. So expect the game to pull some crazy tricks on you. 

Gameplay wise, it's not as hard as DS1. It includes a lot of easy buttons for players that want them. Like NPC summons that make things incredibly easy. If you don't take those easy buttons, it's very intense and difficult, though. 

PvP and co-op wise it's a million times better. More viable builds. Faster and easier access. 
Well, except soul memory. Which is shitty. But you know.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello friends! I'm /u/subject4680 

I've been modding this sub with /u/WastedUpvotes the past few days and I want to say a few things and ask a few questions about moderation. 

First of all, thanks guys! I didn't expect this sub to get more than say, twenty subscribers. Needless to say I'm shocked, impressed, and overjoyed that you guys want to find cool underrated games with me. 

As is stated in the sidebar, this sub is directly inspired by Extra Credits. And I would very much like to stay true to that inspiration, and so I would like this sub to be focused on two things: fun, and intelligent design in these games. That's what we're looking for. I would love this sub to act as a place to discuss these games from a design perspective as well. 
Furthermore, along with EC, I would like this to be a community united in the idea that games matter. That being said, no game should just be written off. Even the worst games are worth learning from. So no bashing in the comments please. And toxicity and elitism of any kind isn't going to be tolerated. That is non-negotiable. 

So let's love on to some questions. I have no idea how to run a subreddit and have very little time to moderate. So I'd like to turn to you guys when problems arise and hope you guys want to sort them out and make this a better subreddit. 

I guess the first problem we should probably take care of is what defines a "game you might not know"? Obviously, a few of us (or even a lot of us sometimes) will know about a game on this subreddit that nonetheless, deserves or needs more publicity. So we can't just write off everything we've heard of. However, we don't want this sub to become a shithole of wannabe hipsters saying "OMFG HAV U HERD OF MINCRAFT"...... Exaggerating of course. 

So I think it'd be best for us to come up with some solid empirical rules. 

Here's a few I thought of.

1. Games that can be seen on, or were recently featured on, the front page of Steam will be rejected. 
2. Games that have sold more than (no fucking clue what number should go here) units will be kicked out immediately

<TEXT> I consider myself a fairly middle of the road gamer. I hear about things that have become popular and the occasional "hidden gem" and indie games. Given that I have heard of one of those three, I'll allow it. I agree that a lot of things have no place here. If someone was to post say, Minecraft or Psychonauts, or maybe even System Shock, that wouldn't fly. 

And we shouldn't limit ourselves to indie games. 

Maybe the rule should be "if you know less than two people personally who know what this game is, go ahead and post it." Although that creates its own host of problems.... I don't know. I'll think about it. I don't want this post to become a circle-jerk of idiots that think they're hipsters, but I also don't want it to be something interesting only to the most hardcore of gamers.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the input! I considered the idea but to be honest I'm not fond of the way we label games by genre. They tend to say very little. I would try to come up with a new labeling system but I'm way too lazy for that. So until we get some good ideas on how to define game genres, I'll wait on that.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Risk Of Rain- A rogue-like... </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A rogue like... Thing. It's an action platformer focused mostly on getting resources, using them to buy randomized items, and learning to master different classes with unique abilities. The different classes feel truly unique and none of them feel quite like playing any of the others. 

I dumped a stupid amount of time into this and I loved every second of it.

<TEXT> I feel like no book teaches compassion quite as well as East of Eden, or really most Steinbeck books. But preferably East of Eden. It's long, but worth every second of it. I generally have a horribly short attention span and I didn't struggle as I thought I would. 

The Sound and The Fury helped me with a similar problem, but you definitely have to be viewing it through the right lens, thinking about how being more compassionate and forgiving could help, by looking at really really cynical and pretentious characters. So it could work, but it could go either way. Either way, that's my two cents. Good luck, friend! </TEXT>

<TITLE> I think a ghost might have talked to me at Ted Bundy's house </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-14 09:26:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A few nights ago my girlfriend took me to Ted Bundy's creepy little basement in the woods as she rather likes those creepy sort of things. We were walking through the woods for a while and it was not quite dark. The sun was starting to set. 

I was in my normal state of mind as we walked. I'm usually a pretty skipping-through-the-daisies person, living my life going along, a little bit dazed. 

We came to what just looked like a door into the mountain, steel with a window cut out of it. 

When I saw it I became alert, suddenly a bit confused. My girlfriend later told me I said "this is wrong" as soon as I saw it. 

I turned on the flashlight on my phone and peered through the window. I looked down it for a little while, staring down a cement stairway. I jumped, and shouted, and ran suddenly. "What's going on, what did you see." "We need to leave this is wrong something's wrong" I kept saying over and over again, dragging her out of the woods as she laughed and called me a pussy. 

I don't remember seeing anything. It felt like I did see something. But I can't identify it. As the pain faded another emotion took its place. Fear, but not "I'm afraid I will be hurt" sort of fear. It was a defeated fear, as if I knew I was going to die and there was going to be so much pain and there was nothing I could do about it. And I couldn't get the imagine of that stairway out of my head. I kept seeing it and dirty blonde hair falling in front of my face, in a few strands. I have short brown hair. I didn't have this memory, but it was as if I was vividly recalling being dragged down that staircase, crying. 

As we drove off I heard a noise too. I would have thought it was ringing in my ears but it sounded... Prettier I guess. It sounded like some metal spinning quickly on a machine. A power tool sorta noise. 

It moved in what felt like intentional patterns around my head and body. 

Time passed and by the time we got home I couldn't hear it anymore and I felt perfectly fine. Normal as ever. 

What do you think happened? Could I just have been very spooked?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mine began in seventh grade when the class read Animal Farm. Before that I had always thought literature existed solely for entertainment, and I thought there were many better ways of being entertained. Books were just stories. Animal Farm was different. For the first time I was told to analyze a book and try to find deeper meaning. Normally I would have said this was obnoxiously searching for something the author never wanted in their little story, but Animal Farm made me face the fact that I was wrong. It took me a long while to want to read into books with less obvious symbols and meanings, but after reading this book I knew literature had an extreme importance.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've thought about that. IMO I think writers probably get a lot more frustrated by words than most people. I'm no writer but I can relate in that stories seem to be much more effective translations of reality than words. I think that's why novels are "more popular" than poetry. Because novels (generally) tell stories where poems (generally) use words. One is more effective. And I think authors more than anyone realize that fact.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll go first. I really liked the scene where Samual punched Adam. I was frankly shocked and I think this shows what's so good about the book. It was hardly mentioned how dramatic character development this but we understood this anyway. 

The scene where Cathy shoots Adam sorta haunts me. That entire chapter built tension really well, and even though we knew what was coming I was still frightened by it, hardly believing it.

Also just... any scene involving Caleb. I love that kid.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I finished it last night and... wow. I'm honestly very sad it's over. I've never enjoyed reading a book more. No book has made me feel more emotions in my entire life, and no book has shown me more about the world than this.

So, here are my questions for anyone that would like to discuss it:

What are your favorite scenes?

Who are your favorite characters?

What books like this could you suggest?

How does this compare with other Steinbeck novels?

And please just say anything else you'd like to throw out there.

Thank you! </TEXT>

And we feel sympathy anyway, so it's not really that big of a deal for a lot of people.

<TITLE> The Eberron Campaign I Just Started </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-04-26 01:19:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just started a D D 4e Campaign in Eberron, and I'm really excited about the story of it. It's my first long-term campaign, and I'd love to tell you the story and hear your feedback. Note that there are several differences between my Eberron world, and the traditional one, but the it's mostly steadfast. 

The characters survived the mourning. In fact, they are the only mortal to have survived. Every soldier. Every spy. Every civilian of Cyre. Every captain. All slaughtered by the mourning. The characters find their way out of the place, protected by a dragonmark branded onto their skin in an explosion moments before the mourning. 

The were on a rescue mission to save two people: a spy named ir'Gadden, and a noble named Blackwood. They succeeded, but just barely, after wading their way through a sea of emerald claw agents.

Four years later, old wounds reopen. The characters are invited to live in Sharn by ir'Gadden, now an extremely wealthy government official in Breland. On their first day in Sharn, they attend a remembrance ceremony, where they are attacked once again by the emerald claw, led by Blackwood.

After this, they come onto the radar of House Jorasco. A representative tells them the House is on a hunt to cure to mournland, and they think finding the cause of it is the first step. They tell the players there is were several emerald claw agents on the day of the mourning, and that this might have some correlation. 

Naturally, the next stop for the players is Karrnath. On the way there, their train is attacked by goblins, whom they liberate from their cruel necromancer masters. The goblins swear their allegiance and join the players on their quest.

When they arrive in Karrnath, the players find themselves under attack by the emerald claw. The mysterious leader of this organization has ordered the players' deaths. After several adventures involving this, the characters enter the paragon tier. 

In which everything gets serious! The characters are invited to a ball in the castle of the king of Karrnath, who is actually a vampire! After a run-in with a medusa at the party, and a human lich in the dungeon, the players find out the king's secret, and kill him.

In his dying word, they learn the mourning DID have a lot to do with Karrnath, but not as much as it to do with a secret coalition made of members of house Cannith and the leaders of the Emerald Claw. A good place to start might be the religion called The Blood Of Vol. 

Among these people, the characters find and kill Lady Vol, learning the mourning was an event caused by The Bronze Lich, and her god, Venca. They did it to gain enough souls to use necromancy to make an army capable of destroying the world. And for all intensive purposes, they are on track to succeed unhindered.

In their final adventures, the characters hunt the Bronze Lich through the planes, eventually killing her, and in a rare event, killing Venca himself.

Tell me what you think! </TEXT>

<TEXT> "It's all an illusion."
This is stupid without an explanation, so here it is: only the simplest creatures see the world the way it really is. Our view is so tainted, by whatever we think. Our opinions, our thoughts, form the reality we live in. And everyone lives in a different reality. Understanding of this, and a clear mind... leads to that power. Complete control, and understanding. Knowing that... you're wrong, and you're right in the very way you observe the world around you. </TEXT>

True, there is the artificer, but that's not quite what I was thinking, and yes, there is the alchemy mechanic, but it's kinda terrible and not at all what I'd like it to be, so I'm making an Alchemist class! I have school and a lot of homework so I don't expect to have it DONE anytime soon, but I hope to get the heroic tier within 2 weeks to a month. If you would like to make any suggestions, please do! 

TL;DR: I'm making a 4e alchemist class! Any suggestions? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have two stories for this. They're kinda long, so sorry about that. 

1. So, my dad organizes concerts for a living in SLC. One day, a couple of my friends and I were going to a concert. For driving purposes, we decided to just spend the night out at Saltair, which is where the concert was. A LOT of people have died there in its history, be it from drug overdose, the three fires, or the several times it flooded. I got curious, always one interested in the paranormal, and headed into a room where I knew a rockstar had overdosed once. I pulled out a voice recorder, and did my first impulse: starting singing. The next day was an Angels and Airwaves concert, and so I started singing that. By the time I reached one of the last lines of the song, I felt something strange: a hand reaching up and touching my face. Like, I honestly through my friend was there messing with me, but I looked and no one was there. I would love to say I stuck around like the manly man I wish I was, but I left. Quickly. When I listened to the voice recording the next day, there were drums playing along with the melody of the song. Still have no idea why any of that happened. But if it was a ghost, I am proud to say I rocked out with a dead rock star.

2. At my school, we use laptops. A lot. All of the students are required to have one. Also, they give everyone an email under our school website, which has quite a nice "firewall" as I will call it. This firewall prevents anything from getting in or out. You can't email anyone outside the gmail community, and the outside community can't contact that email. Ever. But over the last couple days, strange emails have been arriving from weird adresses. They are always under a name that occurs exactly twice in the united states. They always say something like "hello honey" or "good morning darling" or something of the sort. I tried to email one back, and it said the adress didn't exist. Now, I know what you're thinking: "idiot kid got a virus from a spam-bot. Well, no. I personally checked anyone's laptop I could get my hands on for viruses. None. AND I asked the tech people at our school. These emails heading straight into our inboxes shouldn't be possible. The emails at first were adressed to people with the same first letter of their name as you, than to everyone with at least three letters, and than to you and you alone. If Reddit knows what's going on here, I'd love your help, by the way.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I have two stories from my school, although I guess they weren't just for amusement, but they were entirely made by the teachers. So, there are two teachers at my school that do interesting things. The first is a fourth grade teacher. To demonstrate that racism sucks, she sets aside everyone with blue eyes. Until the end of the day they have to sit at the back of the classroom, can't go to recess, sit at the back of the lunch line, ect. ect. ect. The students don't have a clue what's going on until the teacher explains that this is how racism works, and why it sucks. 
The other teacher is teaching 5th graders about the revolutionary war. One day, the teacher dons a crown to class and makes everyone call him The King. He starts charging them to do mundane things. A penny to go to the bathroom. A quarter to go to recess. 50 cents to bring a water bottle, a quarter for a pencil, and they aren't allowed to bring pencils to class anymore, ect, ect, ect. On top of this, he starts to ignore basically anything the students request. He than makes them write a constitution and declaration of independence to free themselves. I always thought this was great. </TEXT>

does not change the power's other effects.

Playing an illithid
Most illithids are nothing but malice, spite and dominating forces in the world.
 They came from the Far Realm long ago and now reside largely in the Underdark. 
Illithid society is a free-for-all, with very little structure or hierarchy. 
Illithids commonly kill each other and devour each other for no other reason than pure sport. 
Parents abondon their young immediately after "birth".
 An illithid must make its own way through a hard, cruel and bitter existance.

However, maybe once or twice throughout all of the world's ancient history, 
a solitary illithid has broken from the sadistic traditions of its race. 
Illithids are viewed with fear and animosity, and not withour reason.
 Many races have a deep-rooted hatred of illithids and all that they stand for. 
Therefore, an illithid that has broken from its kind will face a great deal of hatred and anguish directed 
at it as it ventures into the world.
 A solitary illithid is most likely attacked on sight in most civilized societies. 
Most illithids detest the name Mind Flayer, growing wildly irate at its mention.

Perhaps the illithid was contacted by a god to fight in its cause,
 or perhaps ran across a mystical spell book which inspired it to find a new path for itself.
 Whatever its reason for adventuring, it must develop its own set of values and ethics, 
which a typical illithid lacks entirely. 

Illithid Characteristics: careful, foreign, insane, intellectual, megalomaniacal, mindful, scheming, cunning, 
sneaky.

 Illithids can use their transliterated Deep Speech names, but some who have forsaken their heritage 
translate their names into Common or another languages. 
Male and Female Deep Speech illithid names: Blorc, Flurr, Goipne, Grinrall, Huum, Klonre, Prar, Trell, Waerrl.
Male and Female Common illithid names: Dispair, Envy, Harm, Kill, Master, Pride, Pain, Slay, Spite, Wound, Wrath.

<TEXT> First off, this is amazing. I can't even find the words to say how impressed and pleased I am with this. The only flaw I can see is saying it favors the fighter class. It might get a bit awkward when they want to use classic fighter armor like plate, chain, and scale. But other than that, I am simply amazing! Thank you for this, and I hope this works for your campaign! </TEXT>

I have a finite amount of time, but I can make five ones by monday (In US timezones). I will consider using almost any request, and ones with more upvotes will get preference when it comes to which ones I will actually do. I will respond to your comments, once I know if I'll be making that race.

<TITLE> My first attempt at a homebrew race. Also the weirdest thing I've ever thought of.  </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-02-09 21:36:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I recently read a post saying there should be half-dwarves, and I consulted my friend who had considerable knowledge on Dwarves. He told me that Dwarves reproduce differently than humans, by spores, like a mushroom. This gave me an idea. I searched through my Monster Manuals, and found a mushroom race, which I than turned into my own Homebrew race, called Shroom-Dwarves. I know this is ridiculous, but I find it to be amusing. 

Here are their stats (Note, this is 4e):
SHROOM-DWARVES

RACIAL TRAITS
Average height: 4'2"-5'0"
Average weight: 200-300 lb. 

Ability Scores: +2 Constitution +2 Wisdom
Size: Medium
Speed: 5
Vision: Blind, Tremorsense 10

Language: Common, Dwarven, Feyspeak 

Skill Bonuses: +2 Nature, +2 Endurance

Fey or Natural Origin: You can choose to be considered Fey or Natural Origin.

Encumbered Speed: You move your normal speed even when it would be reduced by armor or a heavy load. 

Ancestral Proficiency: Choose proficiency with throwing hammers and war hammers OR gain the ability to use staffs as an implement, and gain bonuses from them. 

Double Resistance: Gain five resistance to poison.

Pick one of the two following encounter powers: Roots of the Colony: you take half damage, and one of your allies takes equal damage. OR Sacrifice for the Colony: You take the damage dealt to an ally. 

Hallucinogenic Spores (daily power. Lasts until end of encounter): Aura 1. All enemies attempting an attack against you from within the aura take a -2 to hit. 

Also, I know feyspeak is not actually in D D. That is also homebrew. Thanks for reading!

TL;DR: I crossed Dwarves with mushrooms.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a current game going, and am just getting out of my beginner stage myself as I learn more and read more of the rules, but I have encountered a problem. I have two friends that have heard I play, and are interested in starting out, and I would allow them to join my current campaign, but it already has about ten players, and that's excluding the DM. I would gladly get a new game going for this different group of friends, but that gets me into a new problem. I would like at least three players for a well rounded party for me to DM so they enjoy the game to its full capacity. I have a couple friends that I could potentially get to join, but there's a huge change they'll dismiss it as hugely "nerdy" the second "D D" comes out of my mouth. How exactly could I propose the idea to increase the chances of them being interested? If you actually read that entire thing, I applaud you, by the way.

TL;DR: How can I get people to join my campaign that would enjoy the game, but might dismiss it and laugh if I don't present it well out of fear of it being too nerdy? </TEXT>

So the teachers, at least at my school, are fully aware of it, but as I said, I go to a very small school, and it's almost always dealt with quickly and effectively.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I always start all of my cities with a monument, and than focus on getting production and food, than to all out on wonders. Legalism in the Tradition tree makes this automatic in first four cities, and if your playing cultural that would mean more than all of your cities. 3 to 4 cities can work, but I ideally play with two. This means you have to know how to play REALLY tall. This means you need a lot of food, and production in these cities to make them power houses that can fuel all of your needs.  </TEXT>

I typically attempt to get as many other wonders as possible, but they take second place compared to cultural buildings, and having a functional military.  </TEXT>

I only play on prince (4) so far, but sometimes, in scenarios like that you just have to put everything else on the back burner for a minute and get as much tech and production as you can for the moment, without causing any long lasting damage. With techs, until things start going your way, rush it to the best military units you can get your hands on, and than quickly catch up once your done with the war.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently asked r/DnD for advice on the campaign I was about to start. I just did the first game of it yesterday, and it went very well, mostly due to all of you who gave me advice. Thank you very much!
The player's enjoyed the game, but said I need to make combat a lot shorter and faster (one fight lasted the majority of our three hour session), but everyone enjoyed it nonetheless. 
The setting worked, but I would like to hear some input on how to improve it. The current setting is in a massive city called Blackburn with a really nice area and a ghetto. Different sections are ruled by different dukes. The city is overrun with disease and the players discovered that one of the dukes is a wererat in charge of a Lycanthrope army. They thwarted his plans and kicked him out of his thrown, but he is still alive, and likely to make a comeback.

**TL;DR** I was wondering two things on how to keep improving this campaign:
1. How can I improve the setting, and what should I add to it?
2. What is a good way to make combat faster? </TEXT>
