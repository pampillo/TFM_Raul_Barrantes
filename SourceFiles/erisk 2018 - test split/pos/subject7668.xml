<TEXT> A female friend was crying over her body once and told me she wish she had a perfect body like mine... I felt so bad for her but wow that was like so nice of her to say!

Also the boy I like was holding my hand and arm and goes "holy crap your arms are so delicate. You're so thin" and I just smiled and was like OMGG SWOON  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for asking love! I ended up forcing myself to do some positive things. I made myself take a walk and enjoy the weather and didn't wear any makeup while I did it! So it felt like a successful day in my book. Really turned around from impulsively wanting to down a bottle of wine.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ive had a similar experience. It turned from "ok ill just use IF to manage my tendency to overeat/binge" to "oh god i cannot consume anything before 6 pm even if im absolutely starving" and then i end rewarding myself with a large "dinner" and end up overeating anyways. I think seeking professional help from a nutritionist or ED specialist would be best in OP's case! </TEXT>

<TEXT> i feel i can really relate to you. Im not necessarily underweight and have EDNOS, and have been non stop binging and restricting days for the past few months. More often than not i binge. i feel so stupid because im experiencing horrible physical and emotional symptoms of en ED while staying at what is technically the cusp of a healthy body weight. also i carry my weight in such a where where i dont look very thin. 

sorry this turned into a rant but i just wanted to tell you i understand.  a part of me wishes my stuggles with eating would physically show more so it could validate just how much i struggle with eating on a daily basis. i feel like im suffering in silence because im too "fat" to be considered any sort of anorexic.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My boyfriend is basically very inconsistent. He sometimes will be understanding and kind of sympathetic but honestly most of the time he's annoyed/frustrated with my eating behaviors. He seems to believe it's all about vanity when I've communicated to him many times that it's far more than simply wanting to have a flat stomach. 

The inconsistency really messes with me though because I never know if I can open up to him and get a kind and gentle person who can help soothe my distress or if he will get angry with me and say "it's not that hard. All you have to do is eat." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi! I wish I was more active on this sub like I used to be, there are so many new faces!

Anyways, I've been in a horrible binge/restrict cycle for MONTHs now and it's been causing me to maintain my weight. Today was finally different though. I felt much more in control and had under 500 cals. I haven't even felt tempted to binge at all! What helped was that I was still able to eat three hot dogs for dinner that were only 45 cals a pop! I basically fasted till 930 and ate a nice big dinner. 

Anyone else been having trouble with binging?

<TEXT> A lot of crying. Lol jk. So here I am at 133 for reference and a current pic 


So bc of my issues with binge eating I lost the weight by fasting (or eating sometimes SUPER small before like 6-7 pm or as long as I could go) then eating a bigger meal of like 600 cal or so. So even if I did feel some binge urges later on I could allow myself 200-300 cal of some low cal and high volume like carrots or fruit or sometimes I did even portion out junk food so I didn't feel as deprived.

Basically anything under 900-1000 cal was a success for me! I tried not to beat myself up too much. I lost about 2 pounds a week give or take.

Keeping the weight off is the real struggle.  http://i.imgur.com/3LpiHP8.jpg http://i.imgur.com/VXtcuLf.jpg  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Welcome! I totally relate. I knew i had gained some weight and was probably a little over 120 but when I saw 136 I lost my shit and dropped the weight during the summer. 

I've also been having major issues with binging. I got down to 113.5 and then have been binging for the past few weeks. I don't know my real weight ATM but I'm probably around 115.

<TEXT> So i drunkenly slipped to one of my best friends that I have an eating disorder. We were discussing body image and body dysmorphic disorder and then I said something like "I see myself as chunky when I know my bmi isn't like that" so it became clear what was going on with me. 

He told me that he's always there for me if I need to talk and that he's sorry for what I'm going though.

Since that day he has not brought it up, but I've noticed he'll send me more funny gifs and pictures randomly even though we don't text really and I appreciate it because it feels as though he's trying to brighten my day a bit. 


You absolutely do not have to tell your friend, but if you do end up telling them, you may be surprised with their reaction. Just be clear with them that you're not ready To go into details, but even opening up about it relieves a lot of stress for you and that you just want someone to listen so you feel less alone (if you do feel that way). Best of luck  </TEXT>

<TEXT> this is similar to how i feel. im technically trying to "recover" and im no longer heavily restricting but ill just so happen to "forget" about breakfast and lunch and then have a decent sized dinner and small snack and be oh-so-surprised by the scale still going down when i see my ED team at my college for weigh ins. I dont even feel too disordered anymore because i genuinely am not as hungry anymore, but i am also just not trying to eat more than what is considered "losing" for me. oh well... :----) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've come to realize I'm out of my boyfriends league because people have either flat out told me that without me asking or will just be surprised when they meet him/compliment him on what a "catch" I am, and honestly it doesn't affect our relationship. Only once he has asked me if I think I'm out of his league and I've told him that leagues are a load of bs and I love him and think he's incredibly attractive. He hasn't brought it up since and we are happy together 


Really, try not to be too hard on yourself either. Leagues really are pretty dumb and not everyone is attracted to one type of "ideal" look.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am trying to embrace compliments rather than just be embarrassed/ashamed/not believe the person when I do get them. I used to post wayyy more often and stuff but I've deleted posts and haven't been around as much but this community really is very positive and wonderful. I'm so glad we both found it. 

Also, I really hope so. I am trying to trust what other people say about my appearance rather than let my BDD overrule the compliments. Thank you thank you  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess in a similar way I do have those feelings when I'm around friends. Sometimes they will make comments about how I'm so skinny or that I've lost weight. My friend (who has a killer curvy body.. like small waist and huge hips) was telling me I had the body she wanted and it hurt to hear someone as stunning as she is would say that, especially because I'm starving myself to look this way. It made me embarrassed and I just wished I could shake her and be like "noooo shhh honey ur great and not suffering the way I am to look this way" 

As for my family, it's uncomfortable "showing off" my figure now because they know about the eating shit but luckily they've been pretty unobservant throughout this whole thing so I'm not too worried about them.

Does your family ever make comments to you or something? Is that why you feel shame or is it just that you worry you will worry them? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gotcha, I can relate! Like I'll be proud of my progress but also uncomfortable that my legs are really starting to look a bit too skinny. I used to be slim but very curvy and now I still (think) I have curves when I look in the mirror it I'm waaay thrown off when I see my reflection somewhere that catches me off guard because there's a weird disconnect between my reflection in a real mirror vs my reflection in a window as I'm walking by a store. I wish I know what I really looked like to other people. </TEXT>

For example, because i am used to restricting to about 800 cal or less per day, a binge is a sitting where ill feel like im uncontrollably eating and shoving anything in my mouth whether its fruit or chocolate cake.

<TEXT> You are the king of black and white thinking my friend. This isn't how to world works.
sleep when you need to sleep

IF ONLY! I lay in bed at midnight and can't sleep until the sun is rising 

eat if you need to eat

I wish I could! I'm trying to get there but I'm not there yet.

EVERYONE has issues. **EVERYONE**. Some people just don't deal with them as well as others and don't have the tools to cope effectively. I finally have come to terms with the fact that that is me, and to get better I have to put in a lot of really hard work. But sometimes it really does feel hopeless. 

I don't want you to grovel. I want you to learn to empathize. And see that maybe things aren't so easy to overcome as you have so successfully done in your life?? Even though you come off as a very cold and rude person who is most likely depressed themselves. It's not funny that you're parents died, it's very sad and I can't imagine the pain you must have been in. I lost my mother and am losing my father. It's scary. 

I try to be a likable person to my friends and family, but on the internet I am free to finally get the demons out of my head. And luckily, there are plenty of other people who share similar issues who can empathize.

I suggest you refrain from commenting on posts in /r/depression that suggest that the individual is just attention seeking or doesn't have a struggle that is worthy of feeling suicidal over. 


I finally reached out to /r/depression and felt relived that I came clean of all the horrible urges I've been dealing with, only to be told I'm an attention seeker. If u had posted the same bs a bunch of times and slammed the sub then FUCK YEAH I probably was seeking attention. You are being very unreasonable and hurtful. Does it make you feel good to harass someone online over their mental struggles?

You've had it hard. How's that going for you? Are you happy? You seem to know exactly what should be done in the *very obviously* black and white situation. Be my therapist. Show me the way! Tell me I'm worthless. a waste of existence. It'll change me! I *promise*.

<TEXT> I've encountered a bunch of different MEN on proED. Men do get ED's as well so I don't understand why you're ignoring that fact.


Also, it's so wrong that you seem to be assuming feminists are somehow immune to this disorder. I am a feminist. This disorder started out as a diet for vanity reasons, but turned into something that's eating me alive. It is now is addicting for the sense of control it provides me (while I know the disorder is really controlling me). 

Many of us on proED are unable to recover at this point in our lives. So we look for support. We're not MPA by any means and there are plenty of posts that are all about harm reduction and support outside of our disordered eating habits.

The obsessions I have about food and eating cycle through my brain 90 percent of my day, and being able to talk about them in a group with other people also struggling with a true mental illness like me is comforting because I know I won't be judged. Unlike in real like if I told people these thoughts they would laugh or judge me or just tell me to "go eat something, it's not a big deal. stop obsessing about it". 


Also, regarding that gross exaggeration of a post that may be about a family member being insensitive: can you give me an example? Because the only times I've seen responses where users will say the "concerned family member" is being unhelpful and rude is if they actually ARE being unhelpful and rude. If they are saying things like "just eat already" or "why can't you just eat normally for once" or "what's wrong with you! Just have a meal, it's not that hard" etc. there are very specific ways to go about helping someone with en ED. 

I'd take a look at this website:

<TEXT> Wow this was very hurtful. about two years ago if you said this to me I'd be in denial about it being "attention seeking" because back then, my SI was mainly about attention. Though I did have very strong urges, I was never serious about them and didn't consider following through.

Unfortunately things are different now.


After losing friends because of my behavior and recognizing the shitty person I'd become, I changed myself with therapy. Two years of it. But I went cold turkey on discussing my issues with friends. I wear a really good mask everyday and people keep telling me how much better I am now. It's frustrating but at least people genuinely like me now and don't have to worry that I may harm myself. 



I don't kill myself because I know my father is terminally ill and would die faster if I died first. In the moment when I wrote this post, I didn't think about him and that's scary. He is the factor that holds me back. What ended up happening that night was I told my boyfriend I don't feel good and think I need help, so he held me and made sure he didn't leave my side. He didn't push me to tell him what was going on and I respect that. 


Your comment was very rude and as much as it hurts, I'm just more concerned you'll say something similar to another person who is struggling. Try to empathize a bit before you make such a harsh judgement about a person who is struggling.

My original goal was 120 but that wasn't enough. Now it is 110 and I'm about 112-113 currently, but still feel like I could lose another 10 pounds. I don't wanna keep moving my goal because it's a bad cycle but I just want to feel good about my body :-( </TEXT>

<TEXT> So when I first started dating my bf three years ago, I told him I'm not comfortable with porn and that id rather we not be together if he wants to watch it. I had a traumatic experience with porn when I was a child and have not been able to cope much with it but am still working on it in therapy. He said yeah he won't watch it no prob! He started using it again within a month of me mentioning that and did a shitty job at hiding it. 

Since then I tried to get over it and even tried watching it with him. I faked that I was ok but I had a mental breakdown later that night without him knowing. Yesterday I left the house for a half hour and in that time, he jerked off to porn. I feel like he's waiting for me to leave sometimes to go masturbate. We argued about it and he said *"sometimes I don't want to think about you when I jerk off and I wanna look at other girls"*

That tore me to pieces.

I think I'm going to leave him.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The pretty people from my highschool are all gaining mad weight. I just wanna be the one with a consistent skinny body. I was a twig in middle school and high school because I was an athlete. After college hit me, I gained 15-20 pounds in 3 years, as a result of SSRI meds, binge tendencies, and lack of physical activity. I'm glad I realized it when I did and have already lost the weight. I now weigh what I was when I first came to college.

I know how I have (internally) reacted when I see people I went to highschool with and they gained over 20 pounds. I just *NEVER* want someone to see me that way. I want them to think I got more attractive, rather than fatter. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmm we've been together for three years. We had really good sex at the beginning when I was 116 pounds, then I gained close to 20 pounds and I noticed sex slowed down a lot. I know he's an ass man and always would grab my ass and stuff but it never really led to sex. I think he's still attracted to my body at a higher weight, but doesn't want sex as much when I look like that as opposed to when I look tinier. I just think he doesn't want to tell me I'm better looking now because it would probably (for lack of better words) feed my eating disorder.

Also, in a sick way I think he wants me to be bigger because he gets jealous that other people hit on me   -_- </TEXT>

Also, do you have goal weights set for Halloween? I've been in a bad binge and restrict cycle for awhile so I'm hoping to get control of that and lose my remaining five pounds before Halloween so I can comfortably fit into the XS Harley Quinn costume I ordered.

Does anyone have any ideas for more Halloween costumes? I want to have at least two because I go to college and there's gonna be four days straight of parties. 

EDIT: preferably something cheap/home made for the second costume!

Also this is the costume I ordered! https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0073E565A/ref=mp_s_a_1_10/152-2656204-0031514?ie=UTF8 qid=1475264360 sr=8-10 pi=AC_SX236_SY340_QL65 keywords=harley+quinn+costume </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mean, this is true. Just like being "big boned" is bs. Sure your natural skeletal structure is a layout for how you look but it isn't enough to just say "oh my hips are wide so I can never be skinny".

It annoyed me that OP would say they don't have an "anorexic" body type. Welp, being anorexic myself, that's not cool. Anorexia isn't a "body type"...........

Anyone can become slender or skinny and have a small body if they lose the weight. Without working out, metabolism only fluctuates a bit from person to person.

Also, I am not saying that being bigger is bad at all. I wish I was confident with my body when I had more meat on my bones. </TEXT>

i tried a bunch of meds for about a year but none of them helped at all. they only made me gain weight. 

i used to be able to drag myself to work/class, but now ive missed so many classes that i risk failing. ive been depressed since ive been a toddler, and wanted to hang myself in elementary school. There have been "highs" and lows, but things have taken a turn for the absolute worst this year and i feel theres no way out. i really really have tried sooo hard to get better. I wasted so much money on all sorts of programs and meds, and im worse. 

i want to believe this will pass, i really do, but i also have to be realistic with myself. i know the cycle i am in. i know it will never end. i cannot live this way </TEXT>

I'm a B cup and still have a butt. I'm slender but not a "skinny girl". So many of the actresses on tv border underweight or are underweight, and are what many guys find to be the most attractive. They don't realize how many actresses, models, college girls etc are actually underweight but are attractive because of their proportions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey all. Nothing about my life seems positive anymore. The literal ONLY reason I can say I am alive and haven't killed myself yet is because I feel so bad for my father who lost my mother when I was a baby and has gotten himself sick over it (end stage renal failure, type 2 diabetes, a stroke, etc). If I died I know he would die too. 

Somehow here I am, still thinking about just getting it over with and jumping off the parking deck on the end of my block. I go there sometimes and just look over the edge. I used to feel fear when I peered over but now I almost feel calm like looking down at the ground is soothing. 

My life has become a burden to others. My boyfriend and I have issues because I can't get over shitty things that happened in the past, my dad is worried about me because he knows I've been battling mental health issues and now I'm suddenly losing weight, my sister and I pretend that everything's cool between us, and my friends are all skin deep and not people who I truly connect with. Quite honestly I don't feel a connection between anyone anymore besides my boyfriend whom I also resent and my therapist. 

I've tried a string of different things.. One on one, phone coaching, DBT groups, outpatient, hospitalization, and took them all seriously. I thought I made some solid progress but i fell back into my ways. 

I truly want to die and don't know what to do anymore. I tried everything. I don't want to feel this horrible and draining aching pain every single day of my life and feel my only escape is to end my life. Please for the love of god someone help me  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Unless, of course, you are willing to end the relationship over this issue and feel that you two have irreconcilable differences

ok never in this post did i mention having thoughts of/wanting to break up over this! 

also i think saying "I don't think I should dress conservatively just to make my boyfriend feel comfortable" is straight to the point. i am all about compromise, however i feel very strongly about this topic. i would be more than willing to discuss this with him. i wonder where these sudden feelings are coming from and talking to him about it would be worth the discussion. in hopes of letting him know this has nothing to do with him, i would tell him that dressing the way i do is personal and makes me feel good. its not about just putting on a show for other people. 

im frustrated that he went about this in such a way. he ended up storming out of the room and moved to the living room. im giving him time to cool off and will continue thinking about how to approach this to him in a calm and respectful way, while still communicating to him that id like to dress how i want for halloween and it has nothing to do with him!

also, ive gotten hit on/cat called wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt. in a college town especially, it doesnt really matter what im or other women are wearing, many women dressed down will still attract guys attention.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> i get what you mean that maybe he saw going to parties as a way to like meet someone or hookup or something. i never saw it exclusively as that. and when we committed to eachother, partying was a way to de-stress on weekends and dance with my friends and get drunk together. i dont attend frats, only a close friends who is in a tiny one, and go to house parties with many people i know. now that im in my senior year, i want to go to more events because i havent gone to as many in the past two..really only occasionally. 

 or to modify your behavior as a relationship sacrifice

i think i will stick to dressing how i would like, as it really has nothing to do with him to be honest. i do appreciate your input. i honestly wish he would come to parties with me, but he chooses not to. i respect him, but i dont think i should dress more conservatively on halloween just to make my boyfriend feel more comfortable. 


EDIT: we obviously come from different social circles. it makes me sad that your family would shame a woman dressing in skimpy attire. 

based on your original comment, i worried that you equated "dressing slutty" to "being a slut", which is why i clarified! 

i am certainly not ignoring his feelings! its distressing that he's upset about this, which is why i am posting here. id like to understand and figure out a way to go about this situation and make him feel more secure/confident in our relationship where me dressing in a slutty outfit would make him feel proud for having an attractive and confident girlfriend rather than nervous and annoyed that i would choose these clothes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> thanks for your response! I disagree though, and heres why. weve been together for three years, and ive always dressed the way i do. when i go out, i choose more revealing outfits on days where i feel good about myself. nothing has changed, and he never seemed to fuss much about me going to parties and dressing like that. 

EDIT: also, just because he isnt attending the party doesnt mean that i cannot show skin if id like to? Im just thrown off by that. 
EDIT 2: wait wait wait..why would your family members be pulling you aside? i do not just go prancing around at parties in a thong and bra flirting with whomever hits on me. party attire at the school i go to is slutty, but that does not make me a slut </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for this response. I am really trying to work hard on my all or nothing thinking and the want and almost need to *always* be right. This way of thinking has only been causing me extra stress for years. I'm trying to accept what happened I guess. And by accept I don't mean approve of, I'm just trying to say "ok yeah that happened and it was horrible but fixating on it is only gonna hurt me in the long run." It's pretty obvious how bad the things he did hurt me, and I'm sure he does feel really bad about it. So it's really up to me at this point if I can move past it. I have been working on it and posted here kinda in lala land hoping there would be a quick fix to find a way to let myself forgive him, but I realized that I just have to continue working on it and try to just relax and believe him when he says how much he loves me and is honest with me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yup. I usually eat something under 200 cal between 2 and 3:30 and then don't eat until at least 7. I hold off for as long as I can. Sometimes I'll just unintentionally fast until dinner time and then I'll have a pretty substantial meal of like 500-600 cal and a snack later on. I'm trying to stick to high calorie restriction because I have been having 2000-3000 calorie binges like every other day. </TEXT>

He's been working on being a better and more honest boyfriend and I've seen it, yet I have strong feelings of resentment still :/ I'm just stuck I guess. I hope I don't have to dump him over this because I do think he is a good guy, he just made some shitty, insensitive and immature mistakes because he was dealing with his own issues too. If this resentment is truly something I cannot get over, then it's pretty obvious I'm going to never be able to truly be happy in the relationship  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've beat the dead horse way to much on it with him that I don't think it's helpful to continue bringing it up. He told me that he can't let this continue dragging him down anymore and that it happened so long ago and it's something I have to work through with my therapist. He has apologized and seems like he means it. He has tried to be patient with me as much as he can but I think he's right in that he can't make it any better and he's done what he can. It's no so much as how he talks about it, but it's what he does that shows me he's working on being better.

My boyfriend also deleted Facebook after one of the incidents involved Facebook. He hasn't had it for over a year and if he needs to check something he will always delete it right after again. If I cry, he will hold me and know that I'm sad about the incident, but I just don't really bring it up. 

That's why this is so difficult. I do see he's trying and he does seem to feel remorseful, but I still cannot get over this and fixate on it every day. It makes me feel really hopeful that you were able to get through it with your SO. I'm sorry that happened to you but I'm really glad you worked through it together!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok not really ED related but for people who currently resent someone or have resented someone.. Is it possible to like stop? A part of me resents my boyfriend for a lot of lying and shitty things that happened in our first year of dating. It causes a lot of tension between us, even though it happened over two years ago. I have become fixated on things that happened to the point where they have been a major part of my body image issues and overall poor mental health. What can I do to really believe that he hates what he did in the past and is a better person now? And also to just feel like I'm good enough for him and I'm all he needs? Please anything would be helpful, thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Does anyone else get really surprised when they see a candid photo taken of themselves? Like to the point where they almost don't recognize themselves? When I look in the mirror I still see myself as a little chubby and could be better. But I seriously did not recognize that this was a pic of me for like a few seconds and was shocked that I actually kind of look like a string bean. There are obviously places I can see that I would like to lose from, but still does anyone else experience this? 


Here is the photo:

Either I don't eat much all day and meticulously count every bite I put into my mouth, or I overeat/binge and want to cry and hide myself in shame and try to avoid counting the monstrosity that just took place. Eating a "normal" amount to maintain my weight seems almost impossible, and even if I were to eat that amount I would probably still feel incredibly guilty and stressed out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello Reddit!

My boyfriend and I have been dating for three years. Things have been rocky at points but recently things seem to be looking up for us. We've been living together officially for the past year, and basically lived together in our dorms for the other two years. 

Marriage doesn't seem like something he wants in general at all, so I know it's not just me. When he was younger, his father cheated on his mom and left him, his sister, and his mom alone. He wasn't truly a part of his life until the end of high school (so it seems). 

We were watching a tv show where marriage was brought up and he says to me "I don't even wanna get married". I asked him why and he said "I mean, divorce and all that bullshit. Like I want to be with you forever but just no marriage". I was like "oh, well I'd like to get married eventually" and he said "how about I just buy you a dress and you can wear it around!". I guess he was trying to make light of the situation. We ended up just calmly dropping the conversation.

I'd like to eventually get married because it shows a true commitment, especially if we are eventually going to have kids (something he seems to want some day). I also like the idea of a (small) wedding and having all of our friends and family there for us to support us. Also the obvious financial reasons of course. 

**TL;DR** My boyfriend doesn't ever want to get married due to his fear of divorce. He doesn't think it's worth it. It's definitely in my future plans to get married to someone I love, and while I do love him dearly, this is kind of making me think a lot about what I want in terms of us.

<TEXT> When I was my highest at 136 and had just gotten back from the gym, my boyfriend and I were fighting about something. I totally forget what it was but it was totally irrelevant.  He then gets frustrated and blurts out something like "you fucking sausage!" I could tell he didn't even think about the words he was using. He never has called me a word like that and never commented on how much weight I've gained, so hearing him say that felt like he had been holding it in for awhile and was grossed out by my weight, and finally broke and let it slip that he thinks I'm a sausage. It makes me nauseous to think about this moment.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really? Wow thanks :) I've kind of been all over the place. I started restricting back in Late June when I was about 136 pounds, and stayed at about 500-600 for one or two weeks. Then I did some higher restriction at 700-800. I had some slip ups where I would overeat and have like 2000 calories, but it never truly hindered my progress.
 
 In August I started trying much higher restriction at 900-1000 but started bouncing all over the place. Some days id have 1000, others 500, 1200, 2000 ..etc. this has still being going on up until this point. I ate around 3000 calories last night-my highest binge yet :/. However, I still seem to be losing about 2.4 pounds a week.... I'm not questioning it. 

As for working out, I rarely do. The only times I MIGHT go to the gym is the day after over eating to try and make up for it. I also do 100 weighted squats every week. Besides that I'm pretty much a potato. Now that classes have started up (I'm a student) I've been walking a ton, so that'll hopefully speed up progress. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I only exercise the day after a binge. I mostly restrict every day to about 600-850 cal, but in the last few weeks I've had two or three technically overeating sessions where I ate 2000-3000 cal in a day. The day after I'll feel bloated and gross and actually have some energy for once, so I channel it into working out To try and lessen the damage of my binge. </TEXT>

I worried they wouldn't take me seriously because I felt like 800 was a lot for someone with with an ED, but they're really just happy to help. Also, if you have been gaining on 800-900 cal a day then you may have an underlying health issue that may be preventing the weight loss/causing weight gain. </TEXT>

Last night I went to see a musician I really enjoy and couldn't even focus. I started doing DBT techniques to try to calm down, but nothing really worked. For 3/4 of his set, I was shaking and hoping my boyfriend wouldn't look over at me and see my teary eyes because it would ruin the show for him. I feel like such a burden because he paid but I couldn't even enjoy it and he could tell ):  </TEXT>

From your posts, your boyfriend sounds supportive of you and like a very caring individual, so I would try to be a little easier on yourself! He loves you no matter what your weight bb 


I hope when I get down to at least 112, I'll just maintain it and eat like a normal person again. I feel Like a "wannarexic" too because I'm EDNOS but too fat to be considered anorexic. I'm at a "healthy weight".. Whatever that means :| </TEXT>

<TEXT> For a person with anorexia, a loss of control and eating beyond feeling full feels like a binge to me, though other people may not consider it one. Technically it may be considered "overeating" rather than a binge, but it's that extreme "unable to control myself" behavior that makes me feel like it's more so a binge rather than just eating a bit more past my comfort zone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The smaller you get, the quicker you'll get drunk :D maybe try to focus on your calories as a whole rather than food and then booze. I stay at around 900 a day and if I know I'll be drinking I leave 300-400 for vodka and diet soda so I don't go over. So I guess planning out your day with your drinks included could help! </TEXT>

<TEXT> thanks for you input! that really makes me feel better, i appreciate it. i feel like perhaps im in the middle? i gain weight quickest on my thighs but also do definitely gain relatively fast on my bust. For example, when i was 115 i still had a bubble butt and around a 34 B chest, and a tiny waist. I gained weight to about 132-136 and my ass was huge and my chest grew to a 34 C, an entire cup size. Im totally cool with being pear shaped as well, i just got worried because my friend told me i have a "boyish" body and it made me feel so un-feminine and self conscious. Im not sure why she said that.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thinspiration really helped me out. When I felt like binging I looked at thinspo... Especially photos of people I know who are underweight and beautiful. 

Also, I'm not sure what the biggest reason you want to lose weight is for, but for me I just wanna feel like I'm good enough for my boyfriend and for myself. So I remind myself that when I feel like eating a ton. I try not to reward myself with food as well when I restricted really well for the day because I think about how light I'll feel in the morning (-: </TEXT>

<TEXT> So for the past few days ive tried upping my intake to 900-1000 cal a day so i dont feel so sluggish (and so my boyfriend kind of gets off  my case) but my weight has been going up instead! i messed up a few days ago and had 1300 but the last few days ive been at 1000 or under. My TDEE is somewhere around 1500-1600 cal if im a potato, but ive been biking a bit to places around campus so i thought that should help.

I was around 118 when i was weighed on thursday and ive ballooned up to 121ish. Is this all water weight or what?! SOMEONE HELP! ive kinda been panicking but i keep trying to remind myself that with the amount im eating, i HAVE to be losing weight still..right?  </TEXT>

 I also hate my face. I think it's probably deformed or something.

When I look at my face in the mirror I think it looks ok, if not even kinda nice but when I take a photo of myself or see myself in photos, it is horribly uneven. I only like one side of my face and am constantly Untagging photos of myself that were taken with the wrong side of my face facing the camera.

<TITLE> How to avoid being hospitalized </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-19 06:36:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey everyone! As i am approaching underweight and have had people noticing my weight loss, people are starting to ask questions and raise concerns about my habits. I'm afraid my family will find out and have me hospitalized, or that my therapist/nutritionist will send me to be hospitalized.


Are there certain things I should avoid saying during sessions so that I cannot be hospitalized? What triggers a hospitalization in general? Is it the weight loss or the way I talk about it? Or is it the more physical symptoms that start appearing the longer my ED continues? Unfortunately I do not have the money for treatment anytime soon. 

As for my family, my father is ill and I do not want to add more stress into his life. He knows I'm seeing a nutritionist at school but I told him that I wanted to eat more balanced meals so that's why I decided to go, especially while I have student insurance. How can I reassure him/other members of my family?

TL:DR; how do I avoid being hospitalized while still losing weight?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is exactly how I feel! Often times my bf will be like "wow you ate all of that?!" Without realizing I haven't eaten in almost 24 hours. The Meal will usually look large at around 600 to 700 cal of super low cal stuff so there's a lot of it, but he doesn't quite get that I'm eating less than 1000 cal a day on any given day. Instead he only sees me devour a "normal person meal" once a day at dinner time and probably doesn't think my ED is real. As much as I don't wanna worry him, I wish he realized how much this really is a struggle for me and how real it truly is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly! I never thought I would feel ashamed eating a single rice cake, especially in front of someone. 

Also, this was my first time pre-eating and it helped me avoid eating a ton of fried chips that I didn't realize came with my meal. Instead, I ate boiled lobster without butter, a half an ear of corn, and a salad without any dressing. Thank god, lol. I even had two vodka diets and stayed under 1000! Yay for small victories  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So today my boyfriend and I planned to cook a stir fry together but now plans have changed and we're going out to dinner. I planned to eat less than 200 cal and then have a good portion of stir fry for dinner. I ended up having a few spoonfuls of cottage cheese at around 2, which was 70-80 cal. Then my bf and I were talking and decided we could use a coupon to go out to dinner and even though I was anxious about going out I figured I could fit it in and stay under 1000 cal. 

Because my stomach was growling so much and started to ache, I decided to have a 40 cal rice cake to calm it down before we have dinner. The first thing he says is "why are you eating! We're going out to dinner soon." And he seemed annoyed/angry. My first thought was "hmm you're right, why am I eating" and I blurted out "I didn't really eat yet today". Then he felt bad and I asked him to not ever ask me "why" I'm eating. I already feel guilty enough as it is. He knows I've been diagnosed with en ED, and knows I've been trying to eat more without feeling guilty. I've communicated that to him.

I just feel like sometimes he's rather insensitive (without trying to be) because he's often very unobservant and doesn't pick up on certain things easily. I'm trying to get into losing weight the healthy way but my ED is preventing that, and sometimes my bf and other people just make it worse -_- </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bi-curious here! 

As for women, I'm attracted to all sorts. But the ones who catch my eye the most are the slim and toned women. I don't really like super muscley women though, so just like not "skinny fat". I want to have this body type as well.

For men, I'm not attracted to fat men.I prefer the low to mid range of a healthy bmi for men, and some tone as well. I guess I do like abs and a muscular back, and decent biceps, but not like overdone! I'm also particularly attracted to tall guys with a little bit of beard going on and glasses. Or like nerdy looking guys.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> * Height: 5'6"

* CW: 124 :( i binged last night and am hoping this is because i haven't pooped yet. 

* HW: 136

* LW: 114 ish

* GW: 115

* UGW: 110

* WL: ~13 pounds

* BMI: 19.9

* Age: 21

* Gender expression: F

So i have always wanted to lose weight and look very skinny but not overly boney (its not a good look on me) and thought that 110 would be too small. But after seeing what people on here look like at similar weights and heights and after researching different thinspo of girls around that height and weight, I decided to change my UGW! Im so excited!

<TEXT> The whole thing just made me feel like he settled for me because he couldn't get her and masturbated to her instead of thinking of me.. Like ever, because she was better than me. I remember he used to make fun of her valley girl "accent" and stuff when we heard her talking next door and I thought it was funny too actually! Then one night we were drunk and standing outside his room in our dorm on Halloween and she was wearing a slutty outfit and when she walked by he said "God damn!" Right in front of my face.. I felt so ashamed. I let that slide and didn't bring it up. Then like a few months later I had to use him computer bc mine broke (which he allowed me to do) and After trying to google something in chrome, it kept auto filling the search bar to her profile and through a gut feeling and then questioning him about the nature and time he was viewing these photos, he eventually told me why he kept looking her up. 

We're still together, and I'm still obviously not past this but am trying to be. I no longer bring it up to him anymore because if we're gonna stay together, bringing this up will only make things worse. I only feel ok talking about this to complete strangers now :/  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My boyfriend masturbated to photos of our dorm neighbor, who he tried to get with before me. And he did it regularly. She was stick thin, tiny, and your typical basic bitch sorority girl. Since then I started having major body image issues and after an event earlier this summer where we went to the beach and I caught him checking out girls who looked and had the same build of the same girl he jerked off too, I kind of went off the deep end and no longer looked at my body the same. Since that time in May, I've lost over 13 pounds and plan to keep going until I look and feel tiny. I don't blame him for my ED, because I know at the end of the day he's not the one restricting my food, but I do think the circumstances made existing body image issues a million times worse and led me to develop this. </TEXT>

I feel like no one would ever be able to tell i have a problem with my eating habits unless i dropped to a unhealthy-looking weight. I started out at 136 and am now 123-124 and NO ONE has said anything...it even makes me question if my body looks any different at all.  </TEXT>

I was incredibly upfront. right after we started hooking up and then became exclusive I told him this deal breaker and said that even though it's embarrassing, that this is just the way I feel. He said that's not a problem for him and that he wouldn't look at porn because he wanted to be together. A month or so later I found out he was lying to me but I stayed with him and tried to change myself.

I feel like I'll never be enough for him, and he's always gonna wish I looked like her or other girls he searched on Facebook  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for your response :) Quite honestly i wrote this when i was upset because he was supposed to be back at 7 and we were going to go out to our favorite restaurant for dinner and i put on a dress and got ready but he had to cancel :/. It just sucked and made me wonder if this is going to happen often in the future because of the nature of his job.

 I am definitely going to see how things are in the next few months. Also, i did text him and tell him i was a little upset about this and worried that his job was gonna screw up time we spend together because he will constantly be checking his work phone/canceling dates/leaving early from things etc. He told me that since they just opened up at a new location, they're getting new workers. He told me he wouldn't stay if it were like this all the time, but he signed up for this knowing it would be rough until they hire more employees. 

Also the relationship has been under a ton of stress in the past year, due to unrelated things. I guess i just jumped to doubts and negative thoughts and ended up on the road to my own little self-fulfilling prophecy. Now that i've thought this through, it seems what's best is to be more patient and as always, effectively communicate these thoughts/concerns to him. Thanks again (: </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey everyone! I'm going to be going grocery shopping soon for the first time since I've been seriously restricting. I was wondering if you guys could please post some items you get with the estimated amount of calories each item is! Also it may be helpful to note I tend to learn more towards savory rather than sweet when I snack. 

Some items I already buy are pickles, boca burgers, tons of lettuce, eggs to hard boil, and light tuna fish. Let me know :)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can totally relate to the whole "hiding it from your SO and pretending like you ate to keep up with the lie". It seriously sucks. I live with my boyfriend and have purged in the other room very discreetly, and always tell him i ate when im at work, and get up early and make noise in the kitchen to make it seem like im making something to eat. Hopefully you can find ways around this! you got this 3 </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you, i know i was super surprised my body looks this different after just 9 pounds but i guess its because i wasnt too big to begin with, but i still have a LONG way to go lol.

As for my hair, thats funny you even bring it up! I was just thinking about going lighter. It's currently ombre (or balayage, basically the same thing tbh) from a chestnut brown to a light (unfortunately yellowish) blonde. It looks more ashy in the photo. There are some parts of it that are lighter blonde because i had highlights previously and they grew out, so dying over them just made them lighter. As for toner, when i got it done i just told my hairdresser that i really wanted it to be as ashy as possible because yellow-blonde would not flatter me. She did her best and it was relatively ashy at first, but i didn't keep up with it and it turned pretty warm and yellow. Since i am no hairdresser, the best suggestion i could give you is to visit your stylist again and ask her to tone your hair. If you tell her you weren't happy with the tone she gave you or were upset it faded really fast, its possible she may tone it for a cheap price or even free!

 Sorry, i guess i don't have too much advice to give here!

EDIT: and yes, i did ask my stylist to lift it as light as she could go :)

So i've been seriously restricting and purging most days for the past 3 weeks and have found to love this. I love feeling in control of my weight for once and the results are finally starting to show. I still feel fat and gross but hopefully getting down a few more pounds will uncover my hipbones and ribs, and perhaps even a slight thigh gap :)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Holy shitballs. This morning I was staring at a box of mac and cheese and debating on eating the entire thing but then saw the lettuce in my fridge and remembered this post. I forgot the pepper but THIS WAS JUST WHAT I NEEDED!! I'm relatively new to the whole restricting game so I'm getting used to it but this really filled me up and was like barely any calories! I never really craved sweets but I always crave a salty chip with a dip and this was a really awesome alternative! Thanks!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am currently at 127 and would like to lose about 10-15 pounds in a month. I've been keeping under around 800 calories a day and have tried fasting some days (though I've been mostly unsuccessful) and have lost about 6 pounds in three weeks. I do not work out but would like to try running and some ab workouts to tone up. What's the most y'all have lost in a month and how did you do it? 

Ps: can't flair right now, I'm on my phone  </TEXT>

<TEXT> He rarely wants to spend time with other people. he just works, plays videogames, eats, and sleeps. I have to drag him out sometimes, and he usually does have fun but he doesnt go out of his way to leave the house for non-work related activities (besides grocery shopping, going to the store, etc)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> thats what i actually have tried! I even was ok with him playing for like 8 hours today when I was at work but asked him to stop playing when i got back but he didnt even do that. I told him that if he played for like 2-3 hours a day that would be OK which i think is relatively reasonable..right? Or is that not? Im really not sure. I dont want to go all controlling and stuff ahhhh.

And yeah we have played together so many times. i would even play longer than 3 hours (my usual gaming time) to spend more time with him. We did that for awhile and it was fine but that was ON TOP OF his other gaming throughout the day!

EDIT: To add to the fact that he continued gaming when i got back from work, I am just more annoyed that I have to ASK him to stop repeatedly and he always asks for a little more time and I usually give in and say fine, but a little time turns into hours and then i turn into a "nag", as he says. </TEXT>

<TEXT> i brought this up to my therapist months ago and thats what she said too! he just started seeing a therapist bi-weekly so hopefully he can explore whats going on with him there. 

And yeah youre right, I shouldnt yell. I just get so upset when i get home from work and everything's a mess and my own significant other doesnt even want to spend time with me :| i hope you can understand. i truly love this man but his behavior has been making me really upset and im having trouble understanding it. 

What do you suggest saying if i do ask him to talk about this? I just feel like ive tried everything. I used to try calm conversations but after they didnt work my frustration would turn outward into anger!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> see, i dont think hes addicted because if he truly was, wouldnt it be very difficult for him to quit? He stopped for two weeks when i discussed it with him, but picked it back up when he bought a new game. i guess it must be just that he prioritizes them over spending time with me...unless im just not really understanding what addiction is which could totally be a possibility!  </TEXT>
