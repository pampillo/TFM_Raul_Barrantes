I apologize for my brain 'malfunctioning' and we figure it out together :] I used to be super embarrassed about it, but now i just joke about it.

<TITLE> 2 interviews today, nerves on 1000%, Help? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-02 16:08:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The past two years i've been teaching at a private school, desperately applying to public. I didn't hear anything back for months from my applications, so I accepted the responsibility of having a student teacher next year. HOWEVER, I now have 2 interviews lined up. I know I'm thinking waaaaaay ahead of myself, but I already feel awful ditching a student teacher if I find a new job. I feel like I'm in the wrong for being selfish about my own advancement. I can't be the first teacher to do this when assigned a student teacher, right?!
I've become more nervous about the possibility of getting the job and having to leave this job than the actual interviews today. 
I know I haven't posed an actual question but...... Any advice on all of this?? 

Thank you! </TEXT>

<TITLE> End of the year stress </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-25 17:43:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I teach high school math to seniors and juniors. The year is coming to a close for the seniors and unnecessary stress is piling. I've already prepared everything from today till the end of the school year for all of my senior classes and am about a third done with my junior end of the year prep (review + final).  
however, for some reason, i'm still on the high end of stress. I broke out in acne recently, and i've never broken out this bad at the end of the school year before (i barely brake out at all actually!!)

SO my question is: how do you destress?    How do you deal with the constant need to do something and feeling like you're behind even when you're not?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm what's labeled as a "nice" teacher, but I am consistent  with my rules. I can imagine not smiling first semester, how are you supposed to build relationships with your students if you're a stone cold rock??
My kids know that I love to joke around and have fun in class, but they also know that if they misbehave they'll get detentions, zeros or whatever other consequence there is. My students know that I take their education and success seriously   their behavior matches that! 

ultimately: consistency in how you reprimand and respond to behavior issues is key!

<TITLE> Getting a Student Teacher, Suggestions? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I'm very excited that I will have a student teacher next fall, and very nervous because its only the end of my 3rd year teaching and 2nd at this school/high school level :)

I have a very basic idea on what i'm supposed to do with my student teacher, based on my memory of what my mentors had me do: self - reflections, lesson plans, week plans, unit plans and of course the mentoring part :) 

If you have had a student teacher before, is there any advice you can give me? 

Thank you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a second year (full time) high school math teacher.  I've been thinking of giving participation a place in my grading. However,  I am unsure of what that looks like on paper and in class.  If you do participation points,  how do you record it?  What % of the  grade do you set it as?  What do you expect your students to do to get full or partial credit for participation?  

Thank you in advance:)) </TEXT>

From the students i heard that she found their senior paper more important than their math class. She was the english office chair and i was a first year in this school so I felt intimidated to say anything. 

She was fired in the middle of second semester last year because she wouldn't teach, she would sit and gossip with the students.... sometimes about things that are not appropriate for a student teacher relationship </TEXT>

There's no trigger for it (unless thinking about work as I'm trying to sleep counts), I just feel suddenly insecure.  I'm doing well and I know I am- my department chair and vp said so post observations.  However, I cannot stop thinking about where I feel that I'm lacking. Maybe I set my expectations too high for my level of experience?  Anyone else going/went through this? Does it get better with time?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can try to understand it, but i do not think it is universal. Saying we should have children to teach is ridiculous. Getting pregnant is not on my to do list for several more years - so according to their logic I wouldn't be able to work my dream job to several more years. Fact of the matter is, young teachers might seem to get "mad more easily" simply due to lack of experience and inability to de-stress outside of work. Older teacher with kids can get mad more easily because they're irritated and stressed with their own children. 

My teaching ability does NOT have anything to do with what's come out of my vagina. I can be a bad teacher with kids or a good teacher without. I can be a good teacher with kids or bad without.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm 25, no kids. I don't get mad easily, if anything my patience is almost too high. I do not yell at my students. If I am angry with them I simply get strict in my tone. I don't consider myself strict in my teaching approach, but i'm not super lenient either. I believe I have a good balance with my students based on mutual respect. I honestly think the whole kid thing is bullshit. Maybe having children will improve my teaching in some way... but it will also add more stress to my life which can be a detriment to my teaching. I know older teachers (in their 40's) who are amazing - students love them, students learn a LOT from them, they are my goals - who do not have children and do not plan on having any ever.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> last year i had a student with a dad who wasnt really present, and when he was he was aggressively present. My grading system is weighted (i teach high school math) and although i've explained that the last time he sent an awful email to me, it didnt stop him from writing one again. This one was all about how awful of a teacher I am and how my teaching philosophy is ruining his daughter and so is the school's grading scale. I was hysterically crying at home because it was my first year full time and I really began to doubt myself. The next day at work I talked to the principal who helped me respond. Apparently this guy's been doing this to teachers at the school for all of his daughter's four years here and i just got caught in the crossfire.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Migraines   Teaching </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-10 17:51:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have chronic acute migraines and have had them all of my adult life (started freshman year of college). I've been to many doctors and neurologists and no one can really give me the proper help. Medicine works only sometimes and usually wears off pretty fast. I can power through them and teach - provided the right medicine  circumstances. However, my migraines cause my head to be all.... funky. I lose my balance, bump into the wall and desks, and trip over myself, which is easy to laugh at with my kids. My words come out of order and I mispronounce things a lot.I havent told my students about my migraines and i didnt really plan too,  but sometimes it's embarrassing. I teach high school math and I am very confident in my skills as both an educator and a mathematician, but when i make mistakes because my head hurts it makes me upset. Migraines are a fact of my existence so i've already accepted that it is what it is - and my students have accepted my weirdness. I often worry that they question my authority on the subject because of the mistakes I make ( I correct them instantly and always know I made one right after.... but still...).  
Does anyone else go through this?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi! I am recovering and i'd like to think full recovery is within grasp. I have been to DBT when i was 16 but i didnt take it seriously, i'm sure if i did it would be very beneficial to me! I had a therapist until 2 years ago, with whom i worked INTENSELY on all my symptoms. I've been off meds for about 6 years now and have been very much fine:) I have had relapses related to cutting, once every one or two years since i was 17. They  last literally a day and i snap out of it like 'wtf did i just do'. 
I think i'm at a very stable point in my life, depression and anxiety still get the best of me (might get a therapist for that soon...maybe), but other symptoms are pretty much gone/i have learned to deal without involving anyone or letting it out on anyone. I have a full time job in the career i've dreamed about, an amazing relationship- a HEALTHY relationship (never thought this was possible with our disorder tbh),  and i live on my own, all independent n stuff:) 
So I think i'm close. I strongly believe it is possible to recover with the right help.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> your health is more important than keeping up with grading (at the moment) So I hope that you take the time to recover and worry about grading later. Maybe you'll fall a little behind, but you'll catch up in no time! 
I have emergency sub plans ready for when i am sick, which are usually ACT prep (i teach high school math to jrs and srs) Or some sort of basic review. That way grading them is just a skim instead of hardcore grading </TEXT>

<TEXT> Currently teaching at one! It depends on your school. I work at a reputable Catholic school, but i earn pennies compared to my peers in the public school system. We had the hardest time finding another math teacher this year, mostly because its hard to find someone who will work for this pay. I love working here, but I cannot make due with this salary for long </TEXT>

<TEXT> The standard signs are sudden lack of interest, drop in grades, constantly tired, irritable, withdrawn, change of regular behavior, or associating with troublemakers suddenly. Although these are telling signs, they dont always show. Sometimes, you see it in their eyes. Sometimes, you miss it all together.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey! I'm in Chicago, BA in Secondary Ed and Math.
I couldnt get a full time teaching job till 2 years after graduating (and i got it at a private school, so i'm not even where I want to be). I got lucky and had two maternity/paternity leaves in that time through my college professor. 
I feel very caught up in the lacking experience thing still. I tried finding another job last year after 1 year at my school and didnt even get interviews.... but i did get "No"s! that's better than the radio silence. Maybe this year, after 2 under my belt things might change....

Good Luck! dont give up! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I knew most of my life that I wanted to be a teacher, just something that seemed to be a fact in my life (even though parents wanted me to be a doctor lol). I was always drawn to tutoring my peers, did that pretty decently, patiently, I had a way with words and math:). Later I pursued being a teaching assistant at my place of worship and pressured a teacher into letting me grade for him lol

The defining moments for my decision of going into this career were during my junior and senior year of high school. I was depressed and suicidal. A few teachers saved my life by caring and connecting to me. I feel obligated to give that back. I love every second of my choice, I hope you do too </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm Russian, in my culture there is a stigma about mental disorders. I cannot seem to detach myself from the feeling of embarrassment about my depression and anxiety problems. I stopped seeing my therapist a few years back because of that. I want to see a therapist again, but I feel like I have to wait to be off parents insurance first (6 more months)  just cause of this cultural bullshit that's ingrained in me. 
Anyone else going through a similar situation? How do you go about dealing with the stigma/family?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some suggestions are bullshit (less homework, lots of extra credit etc) others can be something to think about! You just have to weed them out :) 

why they make them? I think the bullshit suggestions come form students who are trying to do as little as possible to pass the class or have an easy way out. Others I think are genuine. I had a student suggest doing more projects the next time I teach the course. I realized she was right, doing more mathematical applications would be amazing for my course. Doing that this year and i see a significant difference in students understanding some concepts! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Had an intense discussion with my a colleague about accepting late work or not. We are high school math teachers. One of our points was that students may receive extra practice when making up the work.The other point was that students will just copy off each other and not actually do the work. Neither of us provides students with extra credit opportunities other than on an examination. Are we both right, maybe? 

What policy do you have on late credit/make up work?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I'm at a wonderful school with wonderful, but it is a private school so the salary is very low and I cannot justify staying here much longer. I have a letter of rec from the department chair from last year ( our contract came in in May, so I wasnt sure if I get to keep the job or not) . As I apply to other jobs this time around, should I say 'do not contact the school' just in case? I do not know that etiquette, and i do not want to lose my job if i cannot find another

thank you! </TEXT>

Wait till you move out and then voice your opinions as much as you want.

<TITLE> Moving in with Boyfriend - need advice </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-31 20:45:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello! I'm moving in with my boyfriend in 6 months (June) so of course i'm already worried about it :P I am a high functioning depressed person, but I use home to defuse a lot. Considering that, home will become where I see my boyfriend. I am really afraid of burdening him with my depression, because its something i battle with daily. I understand that I cannot tell him each time I am depressed why i'm depressed, sometimes it is a battle with myself and I do not want him to feel so helpless. I know that if i want to share why, it has to be something he can comfort me about. 
My plan is, when we sit down to talk about the actual move to say something like the following "I get depressed a lot, and you haven't seen that yet. I promise that when it is something I need you for, I will tell you. Otherwise, I know how to cope and I will be able to get through it. I want you to trust me on that." 

What do you think? Any advice? Am I on the right path? What has your experience been? </TEXT>

Ive read a few articles and asked a few friends and the feedback i've gotten is you make face for your significant other and decide very careful when to share how you're feeling (ie in situations when they can actually help). What do you do? 

Thank you and stay strong  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If she starts seeing a therapist the state has NO authority to cut her out of working with children. Many teachers see therapists, I used to too!! Many teachers I know are on medicine for their depression or anxiety, and thats fine. 
Since she is an adult she cannot be forced into a psych ward unless she winds up in the hospital for a suicide attempt.  

She should seek help. The only way she'll lose her career is if her therapist breaks confidentially (which is illegal, so.... it wont happen)

Teachers are people too, we are allowed to seek treatment for our ailments  </TEXT>

<TITLE> To my fellow colleagues suffering from Depression and Anxiety disorders </TITLE>

<TEXT> We are winning at life. We are changing lives, we are molding minds, even though we suffer so much. We are the big fuck you to this mental illness, we do not let it over take us and distract us from the purpose we have in life. 

I have posted twice on here about teaching with depression and have gotten such great support from everyone, thank you! These were both painful posts about how tough it is to deal with depression, anxiety and teaching all at the same time. However, I forgot to mention how much teaching saves my life. I cannot help my depression or anxiety, it is what it is. I get help, Im working on coping. The best help, however, has been teaching. Even on the days when coping with my mental issues makes teaching hard, I get through it, I succeed. Sometimes there are mornings where suicide and self-harm are on my mind, but I remember how much my kids need me and I get my ass into work. I havent had a good nights sleep in months because of my anxiety, but I remember how much my kids need me, I pull myself together and get my ass into work. I survive the year because I have purpose. No matter how depressed or anxious I get, in the back of my head I have a reason to keep going. 

I hope that our profession is reason enough for you to keep going too. You can do it, I can do it, we can do it. Youre not alone.

<TEXT> I am a young high school teacher with a baby face so I dress as business casual as possible so I look and feel more 'adult'. Black and grey slacks, a few skirts at knee length, always a nice top. Since I teach high school, some students are taller than me, so I make sure my tops cover my chest completely. (I learned from experience, ew). I tend to always wear flats. On the DL I wear converse high tops most of the school year.... unless its the summer or I'm in a skirt lol  
I have colleagues who dress much more casual than I do, but business casual makes me feel and appear more authoritative and professional.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> yes! if you have participation points, you can do that!

Homework: I accept late work. I teach math, math is about practice, so even if its late I take it and give a C for the grade. If students are failing due to not turing in homework, (or failing at all!) I first talk to the student about how late work will help their grade, and I will always send an email or give a call home if they cannot take initiative on their own  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Wanted to Share A Beautiful Teaching Moment </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-04 18:05:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Background story: I teach math to high school juniors and seniors. I ended up with a class of 30 juniors because there was no room on the schedule to make a support class for the students who really needed. Naturally, I ended up with those students along with the high achieving ones too. It has been a very tough class to work with because the differentiation is so vast... and there are SO many students in one room. 

The moment: This happened on top of the whole class being super productive and working the whole time (I worked hard for this!). While making rounds during classwork, I got to witness a high achieving student helping a struggling one. She did not give away the answer, she did not get irritated or upset at how long it was taking him to think and solve. I witnessed him feeling confident and successful and it was so beautiful. 


I hope everyone having a wonderful Tuesday!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi! In my non professional (but experienced) opinion, weed is one of the best medicines for depression and anxiety (but can also make it worse based on the strain, so be careful). I highly recommend you stay away from other drugs, because, as you said yourself, they can make you much worse. If your friends can't hang if they're not f*cked up, you shouldn't be friends with them anyways. Maybe be like "hey i'll get stoned with you, you guys do your thing I'll do mine" and see if that helps. But honestly, if they reject you cause you dont wanna do harder drugs then they're not your friends to begin with. Therapist and medicine is a good idea as well! Stay strong   try to make good choices.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You do have a right to be depressed, but it is important that you learn to cope with it. I often times have a "crash" after having such a great time. It can even last for days. Almost like I used up all my happy hormones. So that part I think is normal for people with depression. 
The fact that you have understood the impact your suicide will have on others and that it is shaping you, it means you are getting better (in my non professional, but experienced opinion). Stay Strong! </TEXT>

<TEXT> hi! I'm kind of in a similar boat as you. I just turned 25 last week, I have an amazing job (almost my dream job!) that pays enoughish, I'm independent, I have a wonderful bf, wonderful friends, I feel that I am skilled at my other hobbies, yet I am consistently depressed. I'm a teacher, its my dream job, it is very rewarding and I'm super passionate about it. It helps me cope with my depression a LOT, but it's summer now and I'm really struggling. From an outside perspective my life is freakin amazing, right? But somehow, every single day I have to remind myself that SH is not an option, and neither is suicide because I dont want to hurt others in my life. What helps me cope the best is constantly being distracted, not letting my mind wander.
Are you sure the career you chose is the right one for you? Is there nothing else that excites you (hobby, a different profession)? Have you tried/thought about trying medicine? 

I dont know if i've helped, but I hope you feel less alone in the struggle

<TEXT> When I feel like this I go work out. Not only does it help with "ok i'm not going to be/feel like a tub of lard", working out also releases those happy hormones that will help you cope and not feel as numb/empty/dead. I know its super hard to get yourself to get up and go work out (speed walk, run, do easy stuff at home if you dont have a gym membership) , but once you do and finish your work out, it will feel a little better. If you do it consistently, it might even feel a lot better. Good luck and stay strong! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Periods + Depression </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-06 17:04:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have been very proud of myself to have come very far in my coping with depression. However, few days before and week of my period.... man do I hit some lows. I'm a teacher and on summer break, so I do not have my job to help distract me (best coping method ever! Love my job). It almost feels like I have forgotten how to deal with lows like this. Past few mornings all I could do was cry it out, and spend most of my day convincing myself SH isnt a good idea. I do my best to distract myself (going out with friends, run errands, read, watch movies, seeing my SO) but because I have SOOO much time free, I find my "period depression" to be so tough to deal with. I have about 1 more left before the school year starts, and I dread it. 
Anyone else have that period depression bs? Any advice on other coping skills? Thank you!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're right to be excited and nervous! Emailing your mentor is a great idea that everyone's mentioned so far, maybe even ask them for a copy of a syllabus for the classes you're teaching. You're definitely expected to go to all the before school orientations, so ask them about those dates too! In order to make it a good experience for your students you have got to try your best, and that's about it. Kids see your effort and passion, they will feed off that. 
And just a little of my two cents about student teaching: You're going to mess up and you're going to have tough days. That's so normal. That's how you learn. I know it doesn't make it easier, but just keep it in mind that we all started off this way. Don't be afraid to ask your mentor or fellow redditors any questions you have. Good Luck!!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This past year life has been amazing to me. My own place, dream job, amazing friends, amazing relationship. However, depression still kicks my ass a few times a week. I cannot come up with a reason for it. I can't find the trigger. I just am depressed because I am. Self harm thoughts come from no where   for no reason  (not followed through, fortunately ). I don't tell anyone about it anymore because the first question is "why" and I have no answer. I keep it all inside cause I feel guilty and burdensome to tell anyone. I can't explain my depression and I don't want them to worry. I always somehow pull through on my own, but I wish I didn't have to.
How do you approach people in your life when you are depressed without a trigger?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've run into this issue waaaaay too much. I am a high school math teacher, and I teach seniors (17/18 year olds). I dont mean to sound full of myself, but I've been told that I am attractive. That being said, a ton of people I meet make disgusting jokes about boys staring at my ass and having crushes/sexual fantasies on me. When I retort with an "ew, those are kids you're talking about." They try and laugh it off as if *I'm* supposed to find it funny too OR even go as far as accuse me of not taking a compliment!!? I find it repulsive   pedophilic. I cannot help my appearance, but why do people think its ok to say this to me?? 

Does anyone else have this problem? How do you deal with it??!?

I have no idea why myself and my younger colleagues get into this brain dead, "i cant do this anymore" type mood when finals come around. Maybe its something you get used to over time? I'm not sure. I had finals early because I taught all Seniors this year, but those last few weeks before graduation and finals this year were so rough. I didnt even want to socialize on the weekends. The end of the year stress is contagious. Once its over, you will feel that relieving smooth glide into the summer:) Its been two weeks since finals for me and i was 100% the second I submitted my grades. I hope the same for you!

First and foremost, I'm in an introvert. On top of that, I hate the gossip about other colleagues, I hate the shit talk about students, I get bored listening about their family   drama at home. The only conversations I enjoy with my other coworkers are about cool projects they/ I  am doing, student success stories, or collaborations on how to help problematic students.

<TEXT> Hi!! I am a high school math teacher with self harm scars. When i interview I wear longer sleeves, not because of my scars but because i think its just more professional. I decided a long time ago that I will NOT get rid of my scars. That I will not hide them when I teach (I'm wearing no sleeves today actually, its 80!).  

In my opinion, it is SO important for kids to see them. You never know who needs to. I have had one student confront me about them and I was able to have the "you can get through this, it *does* get better with time and help and effort" conversation. Can you imagine if you had the opportunity when you were a student? I can. It would have been life changing, dont you think?? 3 

So proud of you for getting this far.  </TEXT>

I guess I'm most worried about the contract. One teacher has been let go in the math department, so I'm assuming they wont let go two since now there are only 5 left. ugh nerves.

<TEXT> I teach all seniors, and it is finals week for them this week.... and my principal still hasn't come to observe me (which also means I didn't get my contract). I have 4 juniors in my first period class and my last lesson with them will be next Monday. After that they will be working on an in class project. Should I tell my principal to come observe me Monday? I'm mostly worried about not knowing about my contract/having a job for next year. (although i'm 99.9% sure I have a job for next year...that 0.1% bothers me). OR should I not say anything because this is his responsibility? 

ps. My math chair said dont say anything, but my nerves are getting the best of me.

<TEXT> Hi! I'm a high school math teacher who is very enthused with the cannabis industry as well. I have not experienced drug testing. As for students: Stick to the 'say no to drugs' policy. Dont talk about it with them in an approving tone. If they bring up cannabis, bring up the repercussions  (i usually talk about the legal issues, because morally I cant tell them that cannabis is bad). Dont talk to staff members about your cannabis.... enthusiasm. Its none of their business   it keeps you safe.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> hi! USA here, I got my degree in Illinois. I majored in Secondary Education (grades 6-12) and Mathematics. You have to double major (sort of) for secondary ed. I took the same courses as math majors did, and also a bunch of education philosophy courses. We were required to do 120 hours of observation in different schools during our 4 years, and at the end of our 4 years we do student teaching. We pick a school, get mentored by a teacher and teach courses by ourselves for 10-12 weeks before graduation. Honestly, the most i've learned about teaching was in those 10-12 weeks of teaching vs the  4 years of college classes!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Remember that teaching isnt a competition. Teaching is experience and growth. You cannot possibly be as great as an experienced teacher, thats just not realistic. What helped me get over it is doing the best that I could do and being proud of my little accomplishments. One day you (and I!) will be as legendary as the experienced teachers :) But for now, let's just be our best and be proud of it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a firm believer that if you're meant to teach you will, and if you doubt it- dont do it. If you want, finish your degree and get a masters in something else that you're passionate about. Kids need teachers that want to teach. If you think you might not like it, dont waste your time or theirs </TEXT>

<TEXT> All that is wonderful stuff that I already do! Thank you :)  
HOWEVER, I 100% know that the teacher is keeping them and making them work on their papers. This issue isn't about students trying to miss class and loophole out of thing. This is about a teacher abusing her power and making the kids stay and miss a class because she believes hers is more important.  </TEXT>

This job isnt for everyone. I'm glad you decided to leave because there's nothing worse for you and your students than trying to teach when you hate your job. Cant tell you how many bad teachers exist that do this day in and day out. makes me sad for them and their students </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I am a math teacher and I teach seniors. As most of you know  during senior year students work on a big final research paper for their English course (regardless of level). It is the end of the year   there have been several occasions recently where a student comes in half way through or at the very end of my class period with a pass from a particular english teacher. The student always tells me that they stayed to speak about/work on the english paper. 

This makes me feel very strange. My class is just as important to be in and pass as hers is. I have not confronted her, but I dont see or speak to her much. I've seen her in the halls and didn't smile at her (Im a nice person, so this is almost equivalent to the evil eye for me lol). This teacher has been fired for next school year, so should I even bother doing anything about it?

Thanks!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> By censor I do mean swearing, and also I try to remain neutral on certain topics because I want my students to form their own options about life   such. I like to share my experiences with my students too, it defiantly encourages them to share back. I also know teachers who dont go as far as I do, but that has allowed me to discuss things with students that they wouldn't even talk to their parents about. 
I'm a bit careful about what I share about my personal life. I definitely wont tell them about the crazy nights out I have, or the nitty gritty details of my relationship, but all else generally goes :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh man, well.... as you know, the age of the students you teach influences the interactions. I teach high school students at the moment, and it helps that I am close to them in age (I believe this makes them feel that they feel as though I can relate to them better, which is true). In order to create the relationships I have with my students I make sure on the very first day that they understand that I will be treating them with respect, fairness and also strictness. Once they feel and understand that, they begin to trust me. I am open with them and straight forward, just like I am with anyone else in my life (of course I censor myself with my students).  I believe these things, along with my personality help mold the mentor student-teacher relationship that I have with my kids. 

I'm not sure if that made sense, but the relationship is organic and it is hard to describe how it manifests itself. I put in effort for my students to see me in the way that they do, but I'm not equipped with the lexicon to describe it as accurately as I'd like! </TEXT>

 What has seemed to work for me is reminding them how many days they have left   that those days can hurt or fix their grades. This best works on three seniors in danger of failing   the perfectionists. I have trouble with the middle group.  Let me know what works for you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is my first full year teaching (not counting long term subbing). I've been able to cut my non depressed days to about 10hours, yay!  You're right in the interpretation, the happy full of life person in front of my students *is* me. Teaching is the best distractor for me, it puts my depression on pause. 

I too have some students that I've been notified have depression, however I chose to confide in them instead. I told them something along the lines of "look at how well i'm doing now, you can get to this point too". 

I hope that like you, the more I teach the easier it will get   the more it will help me learn to love life. I just feel so alone in my struggle, professionally, because I do not know any other teachers going through this. If I do, neither of us has told each other. 

Thank you for your reply!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> - Everyone interacts differently with children. If you have a want to become an elementary school teacher you MUST love kids. you will learn how to be around them and deal with them through the classes you take, but mostly through experience. Maybe consider middle school?
-You will never know everything, but you will always know more than the kids you're teaching! I often "reteach" myself concepts, and thats ok. We're human after all. As long as you can act like you know everything and be real with your students when you dont ( like saying "oh man, i'm not sure, i'll look that up and let you know") you will be respected
- discipline is learned through experience. I still kinda suck at it. I teach high school and have the hardest time giving out detentions
-when i have a hard parent do deal with i always turn to my department chair or more experienced colleagues. Remember that you have 24 hours to respond to phone calls and emails, which is plenty of time to ask for help and gather your words. 

If you have a passion to teach, then become a teacher. If you question your passion, dont bother. This is a labor of love.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am a high school math teacher who happens to have depression. I have days where I go to bed crying and wake up crying. Teaching gives me life, and each day I can teach with a smile on my face and pep in my voice. However, I am so depressed that I have trouble concentrating during planning periods and after school, which makes me end up pulling 11 or 12 hour days. I feel like I make at least 1 mistake during my higher math lectures each day that I am depressed. Although I am able to brush it off, I feel that if I wasn't not depressed I would not be making mistakes as often. (when i make mistakes in a non depressed state I don't think about it twice! but you know how depression can be....)

Are there any other teachers that battle with depression outside the classroom? How do you separate your depression from your classroom? Is the only answer "do what makes you feel better"? Thank you.
