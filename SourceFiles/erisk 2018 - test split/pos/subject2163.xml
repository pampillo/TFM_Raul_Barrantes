<TEXT> Thanks for all the responses! Went to Hockey Giant yesterday and got a new helmet and ended up getting what the guy working there said was "their house brand of a visor" I figured I'd spend more money on the helmet and upgrade the visor later. After playing with the visor I will never go back to a cage. It was probably because my cage and helmet were so poorly fitted before but I don't lose sight of the puck anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I've had a cage on my helmet for 10 years and wanna make the switch to a visor. Do any of you guys have experience with Bauer and Oakley visors? The Oakley is $10-$20 more but Bauer claims to use the same HDO optics that Oakley uses in their visors. Is there a distinct difference between the two? Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the suggestion! I actually took them back to Hockey Giant and they suggested the same. I'm gonna duck tape over my blisters and skate in them a few more times just to make sure they don't need to be broken in. The place I took them to get punched said I should skate in them a bit longer before altering the skate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Give it a try man! I was so proud when I learned how to play. I may be a bit biased but I think hockey is one of the hardest sports to play/master. Some people can barely skate on ice, let a lone play a full contact sport while doing it. Being a hockey player is one of the most rewarding things I've done. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The pain I get is from the rubbing. When I first put the skates on, walk out to the ice and skate for a bit there's no pain. But after skating for a while I start to feel it rubbing. The blisters are on the inside of my feet, right below the ankle. I don't feel my foot moving but it definitely is if I'm getting blisters like these. Is it possible that I'm tying my skates too tight? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Breaking in Bauer Skates </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First post on here! So after having CCM Vector 6.0 for the past 10 years I decided it was time to get new skates. I went to Hockey Giant and decided on Bauer Vapor X500. Skates felt good in store, got my feet measured to make sure I got the right fit and I got them baked also. Today I played open hockey with them for about 2 hours, I could feel the blisters forming. I have 2 pretty decent sized blisters in the same exact spot on the inside of both of my feet. Since they're blistering in the same spot I'm hoping I just need to skate with them more to break them in. Any ideas? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Woke up this morning and tried to turn on my PC just to find out I'm getting no power. PSU doesn't kick on, no fans, nothing. At first I thought it was the PSU until I took it out and tested it. First I jumped the green and a black wire and the fan kicked on. I then tested each lead coming off the 24 pin connector and my molex connectors and all the voltages were correct I hooked up my case fans to the PSU and they all started up fine. I think I've narrowed it down to the MOBO but I've never heard of a motherboard just dying like that which has me second guessing myself. Any thoughts would be extremely appreciated! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The wendler I follow is a 5-3-1. Meaning you take percentages of your max and use those each week with a different rep scheme. First week is 3 sets of 5 of gradually increasing weight. The 2nd will be 3 sets of 3 with slightly heavier weights gradually increasing and then your final week would be 1 set of 5, 1 set of 3 and then your very last would be an AMRAP (The last set of every lift will be an AMRAP). You can use that system for your bench, squat, dead and OHP. After each of your main lifts you'll do accessory movements. For example, after squatting you can do RDL's and Bulgarian split squats. I do back, chest and shoulders the same day after my OHP. Considering you have shoulder problems, and I'm not a PT, I don't want to suggest anything as far as your shoulder days go. As for your core you are correct, doing things like reverse kettle bell crunches, barbell rollouts and pallof presses are just a few. Core strength is what is going to make all your lifts go up. Just sharing what has been successful for me! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would look into a wendler program. As a beginner, I think you should seperate your squat and dead. Your bench, squat and dead are very important. I would really focus on building up your base strength and really improve your main lifts. Don't forget about core either! Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So recently I posted in this subreddit that my chair was having problems with the lift piston. I got an immediate response from an employee of DXRacer giving me the email I needed to contact for the warranty (also I didn't even by this chair directly from dxracer). After sending the pictures of the defect that they needed they shipped me a new piston assembly immediately. Upon receiving the new piston I couldn't remove the old one from the wheel base. So I emailed them again and without any questions they sent out a new wheel base immediately! DXRacer gave me one of the best customer experiences I've ever had! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've had my chair for about 6-7 months and I feel like the lift piston is slipping deeper into the wheel base and dragging on my carpet when I move the chair. Has anyone experienced this problem or am I just seeing things? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've found that overhead shrugs grow your traps. Also overhead squats and keep them activated throughout the entire movement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why not just remove the nearby window completely then? I'd rather not see Pokemon that I won't be able to catch and just have Pokemon randomly pop up. I remember walking around my local park for hours tracking Pokemon but now I'll open the app whenever I have free time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like everyone else is saying, work on your flexibility and core strength. It looks like you're comfortable in a low bar squat. A slight lean forward in a low bar squat is okay but you're leaning way too forward. No doubt your legs can handle the weight, it's just your flexibility and core strength holding you back. Try doing barbell rollouts and reverse kettle bell crunches to strengthen your core. </TEXT>
