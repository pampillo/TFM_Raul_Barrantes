<TEXT> In Hero league I just cannot get out of the lower rankings. I am not an amazing player by any stretch but I am usually the one trying to carry the team. So may people at this level play for themselves and not the team and the bitching becomes tiresome. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have only been playing for a few months and I haven't paid for any expansions or cards. 2 questions:

1) Is it possible to do well in Ranked without paying for cards/expansions etc?

2) Can anyone recommend (or link to) good decks for noobs who don't have money to spare (yet)?

Level 18 is the highest I have made it to in ranked. In Arena I usually go 1 - 3 or 2 - 3. Highest wins is a 4 streak.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently reinstalled windows and C:S. When I logged back into Steam, all of the mods and asses I originally subscribed to all returned. As I have so many, is there any way to delete all mods and assets in one go? I know you can enable or disable all but I can only see the option of going through the Mod UI and deleting them all separately. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just can't build good looking cities and it is annoying the hell out of me. I get to circa 80k cims and my city ends up looking completely grid-y no matter how much I try to plan it not to be. When I tyy to stay away from grids my traffic ends up a complete night mare.

I am going to start a whole new city with unlimited money/all unlocked and try and get all my infrastructure planned in advance. 

Any help or tips to keep my city feeling "real" would be gladly appreciated. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Out of your total population how many Cims use public transport? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> At the moment my first proper city (its working well, just ugly as sin - much like me!) has around 92,000 Cims, of that 92,000 around 13,400 use public transport. So roughly 1 in 6.9 Cims use my public transport system (including a few hundred tourists). I wondered if this is a good number or if others have got a higher number of Cims using theirs transport systems compared to overall population and any tips for getting more Cims to use it.

I use small "district" bus lines that go to either a transport hub which links in with metro and trains or just to metro stops. I have tried to keep my metro lines linear but think I may have too many stops. The only people who tend to take my trains are tourists weirdly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Usually with city-builders I build and grow a city organically and plan as I go. After seeing some of the amazing cities posted on here I plan on having a go a building a properly "planned from the start" city using "unlock everything" and "unlimited money". 

Has anyone got an tips for the best way to start? Should I lay out all my freeway interchanges and roads before zoning? Do people have a full plan of what they plan to build before they start?

Also does using edited assets disable achievements or this just for mods that change game mechanics? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is this pay to win or what?

Like many others I've followed the development of this game for a long time, hoping it would be a zombie survival game that blew DayZ out of the water and confined games like WarZ to distant bad memories. But having read player reviews and viewed streams it seems SOE went against the original stand point and airdrops seem to be game breaking and reinforce the view this is pay to win.

As this EA I'm hoping SOE will tune it to make it more fair but before I dive it and buy it can I have some less hysteric opinions on H1Z1 and if it really is pay to win? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I played a fair bit of DayZ SA until I got bored with its limitations and have liked the look of H1Z1 since I first saw it announced. But I can't work out why it's worth paying for EA when eventually it will be free to everyone. 

I know you get the enjoyment of helping to develop and drive the game forward but will those who pay get any advantages or bonuses when the game moves to full release and F2P.

I really want to get it but just can't see why I should pay when it's ultimately free in the future. </TEXT>
