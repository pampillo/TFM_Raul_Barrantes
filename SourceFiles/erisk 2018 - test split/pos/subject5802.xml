<TITLE> Wrestling Terminology Definition #1: Card Subject To Change </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-15 15:39:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I see that some people here are not familiar with the phrase **CARD SUBJECT TO CHANGE**. So I thought I would give you a definition into what this actually means

All Events that WWE Hold have a disclaimer saying "Card Subject To Change" this means that just because Bray Wyatt is booked to defend his championship in two months doesn't mean he will hold it because Card Subject To Change let's the consumer know that the matches on the card are not set in stone, and thus not a spoiler and thus you're not giving us all new information by posting about it.

I thought I needed to clear this up considering I've seen 101 thousand posts about possible spoilers from house shows, hopefully this might decrease the number of these posts popping up. </TEXT>

<TITLE> 20+ 2 81+ Pack Opening </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-06 13:41:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>

6: Savi(82)   Carrasso(81)

7: Iborra(82)   Orellana(81)

8: Mertesacker(83)   Smolnikov(81)

9: Vierinha(81)   Carrasso(81)(DUPE)

10: Marchisio(86)   Gaitan(85)

11: Rulli(82)   Moya(81)

19: Glik(83)   Lamela(81)

20: Rulli(82)(DUPE)   Gignac(82)

So I could have stopped here but I went fuck it and I'm gonna open some more, so as a little Intermission here's 5 Gold upgrade packs:

1: Iturraspe(81)   Quagliarella(79)

<TEXT> The card as im to understand it is:

Mickie James, Alexa Bliss and Natalya vs Naomi, Becky Lynch and Nikki Bella (Pre Show)

Gallows   Anderson vs Cesaro and Sheamus (According to wikipedia this is on the Pre Show) Two Referees for the match

Sasha Banks vs Nia Jax (Pre Show)

Rich Swann (c) vs Neville for the Cruiserweight Championship

Charlotte (c) vs Bayley for the RAW Womens Championship

Kevin Owens (c) vs Roman Reigns for the Universal Championship

AJ Styles (c) vs John Cena for the WWE Championship

30 Man Royal Rumble Match

Matches that should be on the card but probably wont be:

Dean Ambrose (c) vs The Miz for the Intercontinental Championship

American Alpha (c) vs ??? for the Smackdown Live Tag Team Championships

Dolph Ziggler vs Kalisto

<TEXT> He's a fantastic wrestler with a great work ethic and he always gives 100%, sure he hasn't added the flashiest of moved to his Move-Set but he's added: Springboard Stunner, Hurricanrana, Sunset Flip Powerbomb. Plus his Move-Set used to have moves like the spine-buster. His move set is forever changing, I don't know this for sure but I'm pretty sure he's pulled out the Emerald Flowsion. The point is he has plenty of moves, he just gets a bad reputation for having his five moves of doom (Shoulder Tackle, Hip Toss, Spinout Powerbomb, 5 Knuckle Shuffle, AA/FU) but he has plenty more moves. </TEXT>

<TITLE> WWE Live Leeds Full Review </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-07 00:55:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So before the show we had a couple production errors, such as the tron showing the production desktop

**Match 1: The New Day (c) vs Enzo   Cass vs Cesaro   Sheamus vs The Club**

Pretty decent match, back and forth between the four teams, everyone got their stuff in. The New Day won with their big ending thing that I don't know the name of.

**Winners: The New Day**

**Match 2: Bo Dallas vs Neville**

Pretty short match, massive pop for Neville since he's from England, not much offence from bo and Neville hit the red arrow for the win

**Winner: Neville**

**Match 3: The Golden Truth   Darren Young vs The Shining Stars   Titus O' Neil**

So a strange note before the match, Darren Young was announced to be accompanied by Bob Backlund yet Bob was not at ring side for this match, anyway, there's was a few good spots like Goldust going on an atomic drop rampage and almost getting them disqualified and three atomic drops in sync, The faces won with the golden truths tag finisher

**Winners: The Golden Truth   Darren Young**

**Match 4: Chris Jericho vs Sami Zayn**

So Jericho came out first with the list of Jericho and cut a promo on how Leeds was not going on the list after the pop he got just before saying we're going on the list, he then offered the Gift Of Jericho, got another pop, said we didn't deserve that either, scattered sparkle crotch and Yorkshire chants during this promo, then Sami Zayn made his entrance, the crowd sang along with his theme, there was then about 3-4 minutes of Jericho telling the crowd to stop chanting things and refusing to take his scarf off. Then there was about 7 minutes of a proper match with a walls of Jericho spot and Zayn missing a helluva kick, Zayn pinned Jericho after a Blue Thunder Bomb

**Winner: Sami Zayn**

**Match 5: Roman Reigns vs Rusev:**

Roman got cheered loudly, Rusev got mixed to negative response, same old same old Roman reigns and Rusev match, although when Lana got ejected the referee did the cartwheel that Jericho did during Reigns vs Rusev, Reigns won with a spear after breaking out of the accolade

**Winner: Roman Reigns**

*Intermission*

**Match 6: Sin Cara vs Curtis Axel**

Missed most of this match cause I was buying an Enzo And Cass Certified G Shirt and a drink, caught the finish with Sin Cara winning with a Swanton Bomb

**Winner: Sin Cara**

**Match 7: Charlotte, Dana Brooke   Nia Jax vs Bayley, Sasha Banks   Alicia Fox w/ Special Guest Referee Emma**

Emma seemed like a face first off with her interaction with the fans at ringside, right so standard women's six tag, they did a triple suicide dive and it seemed that Sasha landed on her ankle or something as she was down for about 5 minutes or so, anyway Dana Brooke was pinned by Bayley after a Bayley-To-Belly

**Winners: Bayley, Sasha Banks   Alicia Fox**

**Match 8 Kevin Owens vs Seth Rollins in aStreet Fight**

So there was a lot of chants for tables for some reason and a massive pop after KO put Seth through the first one, the match was about 10-15 minutes long, ending with a roll up by KO after a kendo stick to the mid section, Seth then put KO through a table with a buckle bomb onto a table leaning on the corner, Seth then cut a promo about how he finally made it to Leeds after getting injured just before it last year.

**Winner: Kevin Owens**

After The Show:

After the show my friend wanted to see the coach leave for some bizarre reason so we waited there for the superstars, KO, Seth and Sheamus were the only ones to bother to say goodbye to us the others, especially the women, shut the curtains on the coach so they couldn't be seen, we waved them off and someone, couldn't quite see who, waved back through the window of the coach

So that was WWE Leeds, good show overall </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like it's been so long as John Cena as a face, turning him heel would be one of the biggest moments in wrestling history, but there's no right way to do it anymore that would do the scale of the moment justice. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Touching Story About John Cena   Kevin Owens On Talk Is Jericho </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-14 19:29:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm probably not gonna do it justice typing it in my own words so Im gonna give the exact quote ny KO

My son's such a big John Cena fan. He would ask me 'when are you gonna wrestle John Cena?' 'Eh, I don't know, maybe one day.'

We got to do it, his reaction was all over Twitter and Facebook. It went viral because my wife recorded it because she knew what I was doing but he didn't know, he just knew I was going to be on Raw. But also, the coolest part was I went to the Performance Center a few weeks before the match and John was there. I knew he was going to be there, John told me 'bring Owen.' So Owen walked in, he had no idea, it was his first time at the Performance Center, and then he saw John.

[I] was like 'who's that,' [and he said] 'that's John Cena!' John gave him a letter that he handwrote. I don't even know if I'm supposed to say that, I don't know if John is a big fan of me telling this, but he handwrote a letter to my son, like two full pages. Explaining to him like...

I was telling John once when we were preparing a promo, I was saying like 'you know, if you want to make it a little personal, I could talk about this one time WWE had a show at the Bell Centre [in Montreal] and I took my son. I was second row and everybody there knew 'that's Kevin Steen, he's a professional wrestler, but look at him in the second row of the WWE show with his son. I bet he wishes he was in the ring, you know?' But I put that aside because I just wanted my son to be able to shake John Cena's hand, and when your match ended I rushed the guardrail with my son just like any other fan would, and instead of coming around the ring and shaking hands, you just left, you went to the back and my son was crushed. 

And John was like 'oh my God, I'm so sorry.' No, it's fine, he was fine a minute later... I'm just saying, do you want to talk about this [in the promo]? He said 'maybe we keep this for later, but I feel terrible, please tell Owen I'm sorry.'And the letter was John basically apologizing for that. Honestly, as a father, my crowning moment now is that moment when I got to see my son interact with John for the first time, and just see how happy Owen was. And John Cena is the one to thank for that, but I feel like a great dad."

Cena really is a stand up guy </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is anyone else a little bored with all three shield members always being in the main title picture, it's really boring now, I hope Kevin Owens wins and feuds with Jericho or Zayn or even Cass for that matter, I have nothing against Seth, Roman and Ambrose as wrestlers, I just wanna see something different, thoughts? </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a football/soccer fan aswell as wrestling, I don't watch TNA for the same reason I don't watch the MLS, it just feels like a retirement home for great wrestlers, when I think TNA I think, Sting, The Hardys, Bobby Lashley, Hulk Hogan, The Dudley Boyz, the only person that I think of that wasn't in the WWE before TNA is AJ Styles. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dude, I honestly agree fully with you, the guy doesn't care anymore and it pisses me off that he gets booked higher than those with a passion for the business, him going over Ambrose at mania was the stupidest decision they could have made, nobody benefits from Ambrose losing, his matches are boring, other than the 2 matches with undertaker, name one good match that Lesnar has had since then. His matches are so fucking tedious, the mans a beast alright but why should he go over young talent like Ambrose, at least most of Romans matches recently have been entertaining, he needs to either switch up his matches or leave, because the hardcore fans have turned on him and eventually the casual fans will get light of how boring his matches are and they won't like him either. Its such a waste to pair heyman with him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unpopular Opinion:
I don't want a Bullet Club rip off in WWE, 1: we've seen it before in the NWO 2: It would show a complete lack of creativity from creative, I would rather have Balor as the top face on raw, Styles as the top heel on Smackdown, Reigns as the top raw Heel and Ambtose as the top smackdown face, have Gallows and Anderson come into their own as a top tag team, these 4 are some of the best wrestlers of the world so why stick them all together, there's nothing to gain here for all 4 men, plus, knowing WWE, they'll probably just get buried like the nexus then have a new leader like Kevin Owens to try and get them back over. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Roman Reigns vs Rusev:

We start at the 2015 Royal Rumble in which Roman Reigns last eliminated Rusev to win the rumble, they went their separate ways for a while with Rusev feuding with Cena and Dolph, and Roman feuding with Brock, Seth and The Wyatt family, then we come to the November 23rd 2015 Raw in which Rusev attacked Reigns, Joining the League Of Nations, after feuding with Reigns as apart of the League, we get to The 2016 Royal Rumble in which both Reigns and Rusev start the match and Rusev later splashes Reigns through the announce table. After this Rusev takes a step back along with the other members of the League of Nations to Feud with The New Day while Roman feuds with Triple H over the WWE WHC, after Wrestlemania the LON began to fall apart and on the April 28th episode of Smackdown, the group disbanded. Rusev then appeared on the May 2nd episode of Raw, winning a US Title #1 Contenders match by last eliminating Zack Ryder. During this, Roman would feud with AJ Styles. After Rusev won the US title from Kalisto at Extreme Rules. As Rusev retains at MITB against Titus O' Neil and at Battleground against Zack Ryder, Roman drops the Title at MITB, gets suspended and fails to regain it at Battleground, Then on the August 1st episode of Raw, An old rivalry is renewed as Roman attacks Rusev, signalling his chase for the US Title, they feud for a few weeks when at Summerslam, Roman hates Rusev so much over the last year and a half that he snaps and the match is thrown out. I honestly can't wait for the next chapter in this epic rivalry. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After Ric Flairs comment that cruiserweights will never main event Wrestlemania, I thought I'd make a list detailing every cruiserweight in a Wrestlemania main event. I'm putting superstars who would qualify to win the cruiserweight championship at 225 lbs:

Shawn Michaels: 225 lbs: Wrestlemania 12, Wrestlemania 14, Wrestlemania 20, Wrestlemania 23, Wrestlemania 26

Chris Jericho: 224 lbs: Wrestlemania 18

Chris Benoit: 220 lbs: Wrestlemania 20

The Miz: 221 lbs: Wrestlemania 27

Daniel Bryan: 210 lbs: Wrestlemania 30

Seth Rollins: 217 lbs: Wrestlemania 31 (I'm counting this as a triple threat as Seth Rollins cashed in during the match)

And that's all, every cruiserweight to be in the main event of Wrestlemania.

Edit: This is billed weights, I've not got an exact shoot measurement so I used what I had </TEXT>

<TEXT> Splitting the women's division, in my opinion is an awful idea, there's not enough depth in the women's roster to justify splitting it up, if I think now who's active in the women's division then I have:

Sasha Banks

Charlotte

Dana Brooke

Becky Lynch

Natalya

Paige

6 main roster active women, Naomi and Tamina (Injured) have disappeared, Eva Marie hardly appears, Nikki is Injured, Lana and Maryse are managers rather than superstars
There's not enough to say the women should be split, even adding NXT superstars has what, 2 women ready to move up and ones the champion, Nia Jax and Carmella need time to develop into their potential, only Bayley and Asuka are ready and Bayley could do with a little work on the mic, the tag team division has enough depth to justify splitting it but the women don't, 8 people isn't nearly enough to fill out a division on two rosters. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So a thought came to me that we're at the 6th PPV of the year so I thought how about some half year awards. So the Monday after MITB there will be some nominations for awards half way through

As for the awards, so far these are the categories I've got:

Best Match

Worst Match

Best Male Wrestler

Worst Male Wrestler 

Best Raw/Smackdown Moment

Worst Raw/Smackdown Moment

Best Quote

Worst Quote

Best Female Wrestler

Worst Female Wrestler

Best PPV Moment

Worst PPV Moment

Saddest Retirement/Death

Best Return

Best Debut/Call Up

If you have any ideas for new categories, or some nominees for the categories, feel me to let me know.   </TEXT>

1: The Thuganomics gimmick wouldn't really work in a PG environment
2: He's too widely known in the mainstream for being a solid guy, it'd be difficult to turn him heel as his merch sales would drop from him going bad, and that casual audience are too used to seeing Cena as a good guy </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Raw 10 is basically you naming 10 steps WWE should take on Raw every week.

Example: A stipulation should be named for Jericho vs Ambrose at Extreme Rules

Basically just name 10 steps WWE creative should take to book a good raw

This thread will go up every week the day before Raw.

Since this is the first Raw 10 I'm just finding my feet with this so if you have any constructive ideas for these threads or a better idead for the name then feel free to tell me, ill be sure to give credit to who ever the new name comes from.

Thanks and have fun. </TEXT>
