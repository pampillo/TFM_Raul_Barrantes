<TEXT> The worst symptom of a condition to hear about is malaise. It's the seemingly uncaused feeling of general uneasiness or just feeling unwell. And on top of everything, a ton of serious medical conditions cause it. Including cancer... That is awful for a hypochondriac. I wish I never even knew </TEXT>

<TEXT> That sounds awful haha. I went into a patch of I guess chiggers, I'm totally unfamiliar with them but all my friends said that's what they were. Bumps all over the top of my feet and ankles, and scratching them just once made them bleed. I went to the ER over that one.. itchy red bumps on skin are a total no go for me  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Severe hypochondriac over here. I've got lots

If I stumble onto a patch of grass that causes bugs to bite me up, I spend a lot time looking into it. I take pictures of bites to post online and to get feedback I don't have some serious skin condition surfacing. I know it's just bug bites but I have to hear it over and over.

I had heart palpitations once at 18. I spent a year visiting doctors and insisting on more tests. I'm still really in debt over that.

Things go and come off and on. For a few months I'm sure I have a heart condition, in summers it's a serious skin condition. One really common thing is brain cancer. If I forget something like someone's name, or a task I was sure I wouldn't forget. Or if I just slip mentally and screw up a normal task, my mind always goes to brain cancer/tumor. I know that's stupid bit its just always the first thing it jumps to. "I messed that up, that doesn't make sense because I totally should have known this. Maybe a tumor is growing into the part of my brain that stores that knowledge?"

It's really dumb and prevents me from doing a lot of things. Like people have offered for me to go on summer vacation trips with them and I think "that's too far from a good hospital. What if something happens to me? I'll die." so I wont travel places too far from major hospitals or hospitals that I'm familiar with </TEXT>

"I'm surrounded by people, but if my heart finally gives out, what can they really do? They'd be just as confused as I would be if it happened to someone else. It would probably take me a long time to communicate how seriously I needed help. If I had a heart attack or a stroke, I'd be gone by the time help arrived. At best I could look forward to a life of being disabled. And holy shit how embarrassing would it be to have a heart attack here? If it's gonna happen I hope I can make it to the bathroom before anyone notices. But being found on the bathroom floor seems embarrassing too. How will my family react to that?"

"But maybe I'm not having a real problem, and it is in my head. Or maybe this is actually it, and I'm just telling myself to relax and I'm fucking myself over in the process."

"This person is taking it easy on me. They're being too nice. Do they think I'm retarded? Do they feel like they have to take it easy on me?"

"Maybe I am significantly mentally disabled?"

"I'm probably not going to live to see age 30"

"It's probably mental, if I could snap out of my own head I'd be straight. I just need a few more hobbies or a few more friends"

"I can't handle the friends I have. I can't keep track of the hobbies I pursue."

"This isn't my fault, it isn't just in my head. I likely have a neurological disorder that forces me to be like this. Maybe it's cancer or a tumor. That would explain the headache from earlier and my stammering and when I twitch" </TEXT>

<TITLE> Sometimes I think I subconsciously like the anxiety </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-11-24 15:56:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Does anyone else ever feel like that? It's hard to explain it, but I'll try.

I fucking hate anxiety, at least I feel like I do. If there was some quick trick to making it go away, I would be all over it. "If I could make it stop, I'd make it stop". I'd gladly take the "normal" life. I mean, I wouldn't have to be relaxed all of the time. Just normal. Relaxed sometimes and super stressed other times. That sounds awesome compared to NEVER relaxing (which is my state). At least, that's how I think I feel.

But then there's all these methods on fighting your anxiety and bettering yourself. I try them, but they take a lot of time. I do them for an hour, a day or two, whatever, but eventually it's a sort of "this fucking sucks", and I stop. And then it's back to where I was.

As motivated as I feel to address my anxiety, I never actually follow through on it. I realized this and thought it must just be depression. But depression doesn't stop me from doing anything else. If I want something tangible, I still work and save up to buy it. When I want to make a piece of art, I still invest the time into working on it and not letting fucking up make me stop. Getting over anxiety seems like the only thing motivation isn't enough for.

I guess being anxious is just easier than not being anxious. And I'm more comfortable being uncomfortable than I would be if I were relaxing. And I feel sometimes that I subconsciously like the dwelling and the panic, even though consciously I hate it every step of the way. Deep down I prefer this over being better.

And that's what gets me and makes me think I'll never not have anxiety problems. 

Does anybody else ever feel that way about themselves? Am I just over analyzing? How would I approach this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not so much asking anything as much as I am just getting it off my chest and letting somebody know. 

I briefly spoke about it with my doctor. Told her all about my anxiety, said I was worried about side effects. She basically brushed it off with a sort of "you'll be fine", but that doesn't really do much for me. I also said I was concerned about my heart, but she said we should focus on one thing at a time for now and we'll get to that after addressing my BP.

I was pretty squared away when I left my last appointment. Even kinda excited and looking forward to starting the new med. It wasn't until I sat down and looked at the bottle of pills when it was time to take them that I realized I couldn't. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been prescribed a drug to lower my blood pressure a few days ago. But I can't bring myself to take it. 

I have a very high hear bpm, and the idea of trying to lower my blood pressure while having such a high heart rate seems scary. I live alone and I'm afraid that this medicine could end up doing more harm than anything else, and I won't be able to get help.

It also doesn't help that I'm supposed to take it before falling asleep.. but the fear of taking it would be way too much to let me fall asleep with.

I'm not sure what to do about this. I really want to take it, but just the thought of it is making me incredibly anxious. I don't think I can bring myself to doing it </TEXT>

<TITLE> I really don't look forward to life after quitting </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I drink every day, usually for hours on end and go through ~half a fifth a day. It's awesome, and I love how I feel when I drink. The times I have with alcohol have been some of the greatest times of my life. But my habit is destroying my health and getting in the way, so I feel like I have no choice but to try to stop.

But stopping sucks. I've only been sober for a couple days now, and I already have had to call into work because of how I feel. I don't know if I can tough it out and quit while maintaining my job. And I can't lose my job. Losing my job, with my current position in life, would completely fuck me over, in short. I can't let that happen.

And I also feel disappointed knowing what I have to look forward to if I quit. Before I took to drinking, I used to be addicted to another drug. I used it everyday for years, too. But I quit, and even years later, I still want it really bad. I keep away from it fine, but I know enough by now to know that it's never going to stop and I'm always going to deal with wanting it back.  And inbetween my addictions, I did develop new relationships and hobbies and passions.. but none of those ever offer the sake satisfaction like people said they would. So there's always the feeling knowing I'm missing out in a hell of a lot of fun.

And now I have to add another substance to that feeling. I have to look forward to knowing there's even more out there I can't do, and more pleasure I can't have, and that I'm always going to want it. 

Quitting an addiction is hard, but I think I can do it again. I just wish there was more rewards to it, I guess. Something else to help make dealing with that feeling of want for the rest of my life seem a little less shitty. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe this is partly because you were new to sex?

Sex can be a lot of things. I used to get it a lot, and I've.had my fair share of promiscuous sex with randoms I didn't care about. It isn't as fun as when you care about the other person by any means, but personally it was still fun. I still enjoyed it and never felt any sort of bad feelings after a random hookup, regardless of whether they were that attractive or not.

but I can see why some people wouldn't feel right after having sex with someone that's not important to them. It isn't as fun and it doesn't satisfy everything. It doesn't even highlight any of the real reasons why sex is a wonderful and natural thing. It kinda feels like another, but way better, method of masturbation only you get to please someone else in the process too. 

But I don't think I'd feel regret or anything. I might not know myself with enough certainty to be 100%, I don't know, bit I feel like I'm that sure of it. Sorry to hear it lead to harsher feelings for you when you did it.

My only hangup is that I would feel like I was using someone to boost my confidence.

<TEXT> I haven't had sex in a long time. Probably because I haven't been in a relationship in a long time. That's probably because I haven't made friends in a long time.

I just lack the personal connections to develop that side of my life. Mostly because I'm horribly insecure about myself and I've been that way for so long I don't remember how to even "be myself".

I remember one night I met this girl out in town and we realized we used to live in the same town. We spent some time drinking, and it was just one of those lucky nights where I was in that rare perfect state of mind where I could hold a conversation. Things went well, we drank more and more, and so on.

Eventually we found ourselves making out and doing a little fooling around. We didn't have sex, but it was something with someone else all the same. After that, I felt reborn in a way. I was happy the next day, felt more outgoing. Felt kinda like a man instead of a knitted up shell. In short, I was confident. More confident than I had been in years.

But as days went by the weeks started going by and I lost this confidence. I could feel myself losing it every day more and more and it sucked. I haven't found a way to get it back since then.

Fast forward to now. I was chatting with a girl and she confessed she used to like me so much, and she told me she wanted to have sex with me. The issue is I don't like this girl. She's dumb as rocks and she isn't physically attractive to me. But, she's someone. I'm debating taking her up on this and doing the work just to see if that gives me the same sort of rush I had the last time I had a moment of intimacy.

I think, knowing this girl, I could fuck her regularly if I feel the "rush" again afterwards. I could do it and try to maintain that rush for a longer period of time and keep my confidence up. 

Then, while my confidence is up, I could utilize this period of time to be outgoing and build other relationships with people that give me a sense of happiness. And hopefully before the rush wears off I'll have developed enough of a new social standing and become use to it again to be able to maintain it without her.

And I wouldn't feel like I'm using her, since she just wants sex. She isn't looking for a relationship, so she says. And if she develops feelings we'll deal with that when it happens... But honestly I'm not too worried there, I'm more concerned with my own feelings and trying to grasp a chance to pick myself up mentally.

If this can break the constant loneliness am I wrong to do it? Is it too drastic of a means of fixing things? Would it likely just make me develop a new problem? </TEXT>

He has been lucky, but really his skills and intellect have done more for him than luck by this point.

I mean, he killed Gus. Gus was a genius who knew the game inside and out, and Walt still tricked him. I know killing one man isn't everything but still that event was in no way luck </TEXT>

<TEXT> Word, maybe I misunderstood. I got the impression you were implying a significant amount of people are held back by addiction. Some are and all, but it's really very  very few. I think so far I only know one person who I would say is held down by addiction like that.. and I don't think he's actually.homeless anymore but living in horrible conditions that really aren't any better. But shit, a lot of "homes" are worse than the streets in some places.

It's cool you hook people in need up though, because that helps them the most sometimes. It's not the money, just the thought for some people. I try to do it myself but sometimes going check to check you don't have it yourself.

And I am fine when people buy alcohol or cigs or other drugs instead of food or putting it into a savings account. Because when you're homeless, food is worth a lot to you, but you'll usually find it. You'll eventually know what food places to hit up when they close or where to go for a free meal. And a lot of people buy food give food away. But it's just food and you eat it and then you're still in the same place. You feel the same as before. With alcohol for example though, it gives you a sort of break sometimes. It can seriously be the only break of relaxation someone has in their entire life. Sometimes I would rather give someone time to just chill out instead of food because it's still important.

<TEXT> Congratulations on completely misunderstanding homelessness. I've been homeless and been in homeless communities in a few places. Yeah, there are addicts and their addictions cause them to have a harder time.

Very few actually decline a chance at a better life, addicted or not. And when they do, it isn't from the addictions. It's from the loneliness and depression (or other mental illness they have that is exasperated by homeless life) that comes overtime from being homeless. THAT'S what gets people stuck in those positions nearly every single time.

That, and in some places, there really is just no way out for some people

Which is way sadder than it simple being because addictions </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know. I feel like what I look like and my mental health are two of the biggest reasons I slipped into depression. Maybe. It's hard to even remember but I know I deal with them now. Which is fair, because I look fucking diseased. I look like I've been strung out on heroin or something. I'm pretty sure that's the impression I give people, anyway.

And I guess you could reasonably say I swim in my depression, because I've had it for quite a few years and never done anything about it but dwell on it and make myself feel worse about it.

Even if you "like" doing that, it still gets old as fuck. And I know life is easier without expectations and I've avoided those for a long time. But now I'm thinking maybe having some expectations of myself would be just what I need? Maybe not, but I'm not getting motivation anywhere so I don't know. It doesn't sound fun putting forth the effort to fill the expectation, but on the other hand I feel like fuck it, if I fail nobody has to know and I have the rest of my life to keep trying. And if I manage it, I'm going to get to be happy. So that way it feels low risk and high reward and I'm more comfortable taking something like that on.

I guess if I can feel this way others can too even if they have self image issues or if they're concerned with their state of mind.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well I can't speak for people with physical disorders that affect how they look. I imagine that's harder to cope with. But still, your depression adds a layer to your appearance all the sake and you'd still look a lot better without it no matter what disorder you have. You'd still look better if you looked happy.

And yeah I know some people have big issues with how they look. I have them myself. Like I said I hate looking at pictures of myself. I hate looking in the mirror because it usually makes me feel worse. But perhaps confronting these issues in this way is an important step? How do you become comfortable with yourself if you won't look at yourself?

I think this is perfect for people who have self image issues personally. Makes you think you may not always have them and that it would make comparing the photos down the road more intense or something. I dunno, I think if you have a self image issue then seeing yourself look physically better would be worth a lot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is sad as fuck man. No offense, because I used to do it too. But it didn't bring me much joy after a few times so I quit, and I felt shitty pathetic for doing it on reflection. People shouldn't have to do this to look forward to something, but sometimes it plays out that way and they do, and it bothers me I guess.

If you want, and I know it's kinda sketchy to do, you can give me an address or box to mail to and I'll send you regular packages. I have no idea where you live, so what I have to send you might all be stuff you find locally. But I imagine that would be funner than spending money and maybe it would be more interestijg to get some random shit instead of specific stuff? That's what got me when I tried it, I think, I knew what I was getting and I felt like it was too contrived, maybe? I dunno, but yeah, if you want I'll send you stuff that I think is cool or that I'd think you may think is cool for free. 

I'm tight on funds but I could do standard shipping once a week probably. Probably more or less depending on your preferences. I know this sounds silly but man I don't want you to have to buy stuff on Amazon to have something look forward to because it might just make you feel worse like it did me, and if I can help with that I would be really happy to. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Today, I took a random photo of myself. I hate doing that, and I avoid photos at all cost usually. I was a kinda ugly person on a good day, but as you know deep lasting depression takes a toll on how you look because you just stop giving a fuck, which I have done years ago. So I'm a mess aesthetically and I'm usually ashamed when I see myself in photos. But all the same I snapped a picture in hopes it might be angled just right and everything that'd id look okay enough so I could upload it to Facebook since my profile picture I have now is a good 4 years old.

Anyway, I took it, and instantly knew I couldn't upload it. I, as usual, looked the opposite of any sense of the word attractive. I'd share it just so I don't have to explain it, but I'm embarrassed by it. But as I went to delete it I got a huge surge of inspiration from it.

Before I deleted it, I studied it and felt bad about what I've become and how far I've let not caring take me. Standard stuff, really. 

But then I thought this would be perfect for a success story. If I beat my depression and started living a more proper life, in a few years I could take a new happier photo and put it beside this one. When I make friends they will look at it and say "holy fuck that's you!?". I thought about how with a good recovery I could post the two photos side by side and I would bet with a good title and sub placement it would make the front page of Reddit. People will tell me I did a great job, and a few will tell me about their depression and say my photos ment something to them or inspired them. 

With this disgusting photo I have a chance to make a personal development and then quickly but still in a way thoroughly tell my success story in a way that will matter to people. And like I said, maybe inspire them. Maybe become something they regularly mentally reference and think "goddamn I want to do what that guy did." Isn't that a big deal? Wouldn't that be worth a lot of pride? Wouldn't something like that make you happy?

Probably not. The value I would get from seeing this photo next to a new and improved me won't be as intense as I'm imagining it, but that's because by the time I create it, I'm going to be used to happiness again. I'm not going to be desperate for it like I am now, I know. Instead I'll look at it and think "wow" too, and I'm going to be really proud of myself and take every compliment knowing I've earned it.

I know I'm rambling you all, but I'm fucking inspired. I'm motivated. This is something I haven't felt in YEARS. I've looked at hundreds of photos of myself in this state and never felt this. This is the first time that since I've developed my depression I feel like I can actually get past it and feel like I have a real reason to get past it. The satisfaction I'd get will make it worth the work. I've literally never felt that. I mean I have, but there was always self doubt alongside. A sort of "fuck yeah I can do this... Wait, no, look at yourself. It will take years if mental restructuring. I don't think I can actually do this" its hard to explain kinda but you know what I mean. But I'm confident on this one finally.

So I wanted to share my idea. Take a picture when you're feeling depressed. When you feel ashamed of what you are, save it. You're probably thinking "well I look okay", and you might. But even when you dress well depression takes a toll on your looks after a while. Happiness just shines physically. I can't put how into words, but it does. So save your sad photos and imagine looking at them down the road next to a picture of a happy you. Imagine all of the deserved compliments you'd get from people online and the friends you'll make along the way, and then imagine not even needing them because you're already happy. Imagine inspiring someone just like you to do the same thing.

It sounds cheesy as fuck, but I think if it motivates me it.might some of you too. But I think being able to compared these pictures will instill a deep sense of pride you might not be familiar with. It could feel like what it feels like when people see photos of themselves performing great big accomplishments. And I don't think it would ever get old either. So I really.suggest you try this and think about what it could be like. And even if you can't see yourself becoming better based on the idea of a future picture, save it anyway just in case you do beat your depression. It will be fun to compare it later, if nothing else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nah I don't have much of a plan or any dreams. I guess my plan is to try the homeless game again soon because things are not working out financially and that looks inevitable.

I think I want to try a "real" city this time. Nashville is the closest major city so I might try to see what that feels like. There's a ton of people so it seems like it could be great or terrible depending on my luck. 

But then again I really don't have anything other than family, and I don't see them regularly as it is. I guess I could try to snag rides to any city regardless of distance. It sounds pretty dramatic but it sounds kinda exciting too. 

Edit

I don't want anything particular out of life. I guess I DO, since I feel like things are missing, and I definitely want them. I just don't know what they are </TEXT>

<TITLE> How I've ended up where I'm stuck at now </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When I was 18, I graduated highschool and my dad lost his job at the exact same time. So we had to move, and I went with since I didn't have a job.

We moved to a new town out of my old state. I lived here without a job or car for over a year. I never met anyone, never talked to my old friends, or anything. The only people I talked to was my family, outside of cashiers and such. I ended up doing a lot of OTC drugs to get fucked up and just pass time. Everyday was the same. Sometimes I would walk miles to town and hangout at the park to see people my age, but I must've went to the wrong park or at the wrong time, since all I found were families with little kids.

Then my dad lost the house, but he had a girlfriend to live with. By now I'm depressed, developing social anxiety, and I'm homeless. So I go back to my old town. Not many friends are still around, it was a small town and a lot of my circle went off to college or just left to live in a bigger city. There were still plenty of familiar faces, but I couldn't talk to them anymore. Social anxiety was strong enough now that I spent all of my time wandering around along, or looking for odd jobs to buy food. I didn't have clean clothes most of the time, or a car, so I couldn't find a real job. I didn't try TOO hard though because I just didn't have the motivation. I did this for about 4 months, and then moved on to another bigger town with more people.

Pretty much did the same as above for 6 more months. Finally my mom let me live with her. I lived with her for 2 years in another town I didn't know. She got me a car so I could drive places, but I didn't have anyone to visit. But I did get a job at a factory to keep busy and make money. There weren't many people in my section, but I met this one dude who talked to me a bit. Like went out of his way to make effort, even though I could never think of what to say and couldn't hold an actual conversation. It was always "oh yeah?" "Really?""cool". 

Anyway, mom loses her job and I can't pay all the bills. We lose the house and she goes to a friends to live and I'm about to be homeless. My friend let's me live on his couch now, but we're not really friends. We don't talk, see eachother (he works somewhere else now), or anything. Sometimes I think he avoids me but whatever.

So here I am, in a town I don't know with no friends and I'm not optimistic about the future. My mind is so dull, and I don't have a personality anymore. My intellect is lowering too. Sometimes I wonder if I've got some condition or something just ruining my brain. I don't think I can redevelop my social skills and connect with people again.

I just miss it all. I spend a lot of time doing stuff like listening to songs me and friends used to get down to, or songs that remind me of old girlfriends, and wonder when the last time any of them thought about me was. Sometimes I want to get in touch, but then I remember I am not who I was. I've lost my wits, humor, aspirations, personality, just everything. And I'm sure they're different too. 

And then I remember that we are young adults and their lives probably move fast. This shit was all 5 (or more) years ago. They've moved on. And then I feel fucking pathetic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alright so me and a friend picked up a dub of some shit and decided to blaze out tonight. Just some mids, they look/smell/feel all normal.

So we load up a bowl this ceramic bong and my friend rips it. He instantly loses his shit and coughs everywhere, but he coughs out black smoke. It was pretty thick too.

So this is new to us, we've never had some shit like this to us. It seemed sketchy, but we finished the bowl (had to take small hits to keep control). I definitely got pretty high for some mids, but it gave each of us a headache.

About an hour later we roll the rest into a flat blunt and spark it up. This fucking thing is burning crazy as a thick black smoke just bellows off of it. From the amount of smoke it looked like it was burning fast, but it smoked at a normal speed. 

Towards the end of the L I had a coughing fit and ended up throwing up and getting a horrible headache. But I'm still high.

So now I'm home wondering what the fuck that was. It was fire but it was so harsh. I've smoked a lot of weed and never seen this. Do some strains just burn black instead of white? If not is it safe? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Censorship already exists on the internet. Child pornography, for example. 

But child pornography still exists online. This shows that you simply CAN'T efficiently limit content on the internet without completely changing the way it works and trying to limit who has access to it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay this was easy to understand, thanks. So companies periodically release more stocks? By doing that wouldn't they devalue all of the other stocks that people already paid for? 

And I need a broker to buy stocks for me?  Hm, I thought I just kinda did it myself... </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I think I want to try out getting some stocks just because it sounds fun. I don't really know much about how it works though. I've read into it and figured out some basic stuff but some still seems a bit complicated. So I'm wondering if anyone can explain

- What does "points" mean? When a stock goes up in points it goes up in value... but is one point one dollar or how does this conversion work?

- When lots of people sell a particular stock at once it causes problems for the company. If stock prices are based on how the company is doing, why does it matter if people buy and sell their stocks at current value? What does the company lose when lots of people sell their shares at once?

- How do I go about actually buying and holding stocks? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah fuck Jack. Well, not him personally since he's a dog and doesn't really understand what he's doing.. but fuck the people who use dogs to fight the war on drugs. 

I'd rather see those drugs back on the streets than give you an upvote for this shit  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Vapes are solid, but I don't know if it would be the most effective way. For serious pains I think you'd be better off looking into edibles or oils. Only real downside is it could get pretty expensive  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Issues with my game? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I've been playing RCT1 again and I've been going through the basic game scenarios just fine. However today I got around to installing the expansions and got around to messing with them. 

I completed one of the Loopy Landscape scenarios (Arid Heights), saved the game, and then quit to the main menu. I had a new level unlocked, as usual. So I turn the PC off and come back to play again later and notice my newly unlocked scenario is now locked and it says I haven't completed Arid Heights. 

Any idea why this is doing this? My save files are still there... but my career progress seems to reset whenever I quit the game

edit-
I'm running in Windows XP. RCT1 basic still works fine, just the expansions I'm having issues with

EDIT 2 - PROBLEM RESOLVED

Sorry to post a thread asking for help and then figure it out so quickly after. I have actually been messing with this issue for a while though haha. I also had it happen on another computer a long time ago and never figured it out. If anyone else is having this issue:


I ended up going to the 'Data' folder and found file "CSS0" (apparently this is career progress). I renamed it by just throwing an extra letter into the filename (made it "CSS0b" to be exact).

Closed the folder, opened my game, and noticed that all the missing information was now there and my old information was also still there. I loaded the Data folder back up and noticed it made another CSS0 file.. but still, all seems well. I've exited the game and relaunched it a few times now and the data shows up each time </TEXT>

<TITLE> I got an older PC for free and would like advice on where to begin upgrading </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-05-11 03:18:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I just got a free PC from a family member. It runs Win XP 2002 SP3 and it rocks a Pentium 4 CPU 200GHz 1.99GHz (unsure what that means) and 256MB of RAM. Also, it only has a 30gb hard drive. 

I think those are the basics that I should focus on but if anyone has any other ideas and wants to know other specs I'll try to figure them out. 

Anyway, any advice on what part I should consider upgrading? The cost to performance boost is what I'd be most concerned with, but I also want to try to spend as little as possible because I tend to be broke a lot. All I want to use this computer for is browsing the web and downloading things (I can do this fine but it can be laggy switching windows a lot), playing older PC games (I have Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 and it's a little buggy. I want to see how 1 runs), and making music (just really want to run a simple DAW, nothing too extreme) </TEXT>
