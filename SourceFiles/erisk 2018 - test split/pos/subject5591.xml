<TEXT> I actually work out at home! I have a treadmill and elliptical which is nice. Yeah, it was probably around April/May after school finished. I started out slow, maybe 2-3 workouts a week for 30 mins. Wooo! Its so fun seeing results, good for you! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes it was! I'm glad I saw him even though I didn't end up having surgery. I saw the cognitive behavioural psychologist because of my social phobia, I could barely go out in public, and when I did I had crippling anxiety attacks. She also helped me realize my self worth. I hated myself. Why? I'm a good person! I had relied on validation from others for my self worth, and worked really hard to change that. I AM worth it. I doubted myself, how could I be that person who loses all that weight? It sounded impossible. But here I am :) not where I want to be, but a hell of a lot closer than I was! You CAN do it. You ARE worth it. 
This really relates to my social anxiety, but when I'm anxious about something, I'll write down the worst case scenario. Everything awful that I can imagine happening, I write it down. Then I read it out loud. It always sounds ridiculous and soooo unrealistic. Which makes me feel better. Something the psychologist taught me :)
Thank you! Hahah yeah, its strange having people do a double take!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Food wasn't my only issue. I had gone from a straight A student to almost failing out of my second year of uni. I had severe depression and social phobia. The psychologist I see is amazing. She specializes in cognitive behavioural therapy, which I would recommend for anyone with social anxiety. She, more than anything, helped me realize my own self worth. I didn't like myself. Now I can say I'm starting to love myself :) and healthy eating and exercise is something I do because I love myself and my body. I definitely recommend talking to someone! Everybody is different, but I always felt like a huge weight had been lifted every time I left her office. Good luck on your journey! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you!!! I didn't track calories much in the beginning. When I started I tried to keep it between 1200-1500. That's still about where I keep it now, it really depends on the day. I don't track precisely anymore, but sometimes I'll track roughly in my head so I know I'm where I need to be :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you so much! :) Yeah my mental health has improved tremendously! But aside from that, my body feels great. Just doing every day things is so much easier, and sometimes I forget how hard it used to be. I can run up stairs now and not be winded, and before I would have to catch my breath just walking. I feel just generally strong and healthy which is new! Its unbelievable how healthy food and exercise DO make you feel better. Now if I eat crap, I feel like crap, which I never really noticed before.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. My diet now consists mostly of whole foods, I really try to limit processed foods(minus protein shakes and bars), but its nearly impossible to avoid all together. I eat a lot of chicken and turkey, broccoli, spinach salads and potatoes. Sounds pretty boring but changing up how you cook everything helps! Also season EVERYTHING it makes eating much more enjoyable. I drink a protein shake every morning, usually with half an english muffin. It has definitely taken some getting used to, I would recommend baby steps! Eat like usual, but put more veggies on your plate. Drink water instead of pop. Crystal light and Mio really helped me start drinking water. Herbal tea and water are all I drink. I aim to get 3-5L of water per day. It gets easier as you continue, and making tiny changes is sooooooo much easier than completely changing overnight.

2.  I didn't exercise for the first year and I dropped 100lbs. This summer I started doing yoga and HIIT cardio on the elliptical (increasing the resistance for short periods of time). I started doing yoga, body weight exercises and lifting free weights as well. I work out at home, no gym membership! Youtube is AWESOME for workout ideas. Christina Carlyle, Blogilates, Yoga with Adrienne are all great channels to check out! I've recently started running and I'm training for my first 5K coming up! I like keeping my workouts varied, I get bored easily. I aim to workout for at least 30mins 4-6 times a week. I find things I enjoy and do those! I never stick with exercise that I hate. 

3. Yeah. Excess skin is a thing. Its not fun, but it's definitely better than having the fat! My whole body is a mess tbh. But I would take this saggy body over my old body ANY DAY. I'm looking to have surgery in the next year hopefully, and I'll probably need several. But I think everyone deserves to be happy with their body and if surgery is the only way, I'm game.  

4. I started losing gradually around April of 2015. January 2016 I was around 290. That's about when I started getting serious. By April 2016 I was 250 and have lost the last 60 since then. So just under two years I suppose! 


Sorry this is so long. I hope it helps! Please PM if you want more info! Always happy to help! Good luck, I believe in you!!! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh man, that's a tough question. For me its been difficult to find balance. I would feel super guilty about eating a piece of pizza and then just say fuck it and eat more than I should. Which makes zero sense, I know. I've been training myself to eat SMALL amounts of the shittier foods, and not just binge like crazy when I do buy them. So I'll eat a piece of pizza, but first I'll eat a bunch of spinach salad or broccoli (weird combo but whatever haha). It leaves me fuller so I don't even want as much pizza. And sometimes I still end up eating way more than I intended. But I've taught myself to go back to eating well the next day and not worry so much :)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Recently I've been drinking the chocolate Pure Protein, its decently priced at Walmart around here. Pure protein also has decent protein bars! Another favourite is chocolate Genuine Health Proteins+, but that is definitely pricier. Pinterest is great for healthy recipies!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you!! I remember when I stepped on the scale and it said 355.6. At that moment I was like, shit. I'm closer to being 400lbs than 300lbs. That terrified me. And I was 19 and only 5'3.  I realized then that eventually I would hit 400 and probably even higher if I didn't change, and that I really was killing myself. That moment really shook me </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, unfortunately :( I have a toooooooon of loose skin, just about everywhere! I'm hoping by continuing to exercise and tone that it will get better. However I'm pretty sure I'll be looking into several surgeries (arms, boobs, legs, tummy- the works!) probably in the next year.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wrote a whole post over on r/loseit if you wanna check that out! Basically I stopped eating fast food and most processed foods. I only drink water or herbal tea, and try to get in 3-5L a day. I calorie counted for a while, but now just do rough estimates in my head so I don't go crazy. I try to stay around 1500 a day. Also I got my mental health in check with a psychologist, which helped immensely. I try to eat mostly whole foods, but you can't say no to pizza ALL the time :) I also now work out 4-6 days a week, flipping between cardio, weights and yoga! 
  Thank you so much! I feel incredible honestly. It's amazing how eating well and exercising can make you feel strong and healthy!   </TEXT>
