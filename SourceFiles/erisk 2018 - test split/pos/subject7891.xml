<TEXT> That's certainly not what I learnt at college. England has a huge variety of accents, all tied intimately into very pronounced social class structures. What you are probably thinking of as "the English Accent" is called Received Pronunciation or RP and originates in the Home Counties around London. For most of the 19th and 20th centuries, and to an extent now, this was the prestige accent associated with the rich and powerful wealthy enough not to actually have to live in London but who tend to cluster near it for access to Whitehall, the City, and the Royal Court. It's where one can have a stately home with 10,000 acres but still be in Lord's in time for port and cigars.

But the English settlers who first colonised North America didn't come from London or the Home Counties; they came from the area around England's major merchant port of the time, Bristol (called the West Country). The West Country accents still have pronounced terminal /r/s and long flat vowels today, like most North American accents.

So there hasn't actually been that much of a phonemic shift at all. It's just that the settlers never spoke with what you think of as "the English accent".

And as for "the influence of Irish immigrants to New York" - well, just remember that Dublin is a hell of a lot closer to Bristol than it is to New York... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good theory, but the measure you should be looking at is not physical size, but number of regional (or class) accents. Britain has a ridiculous number of different accents, many of which are very distinct (eg. Edinburgh compared with Cockney). We also have very strong associations between accent and social class, much like I understand there is a distinct "redneck" accent. The difference is that in Britain, *EVERY* accent carries its associations and their attendant rivalries and prejudices. Hence the saying that "every time an Englishman opens his mouth, he makes another Englishman hate him." Because of this social function, I suppose British people are conditioned into being more aware of accent.

FWIW, Gwynnie Paltrow did a convincing accent even before she moved over here. Robert Downey Jr is just laughable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The *economic* rather than political opposite of communism is not democracy but capitalism. "Capital" is the concentration of wealth. Capitalism without regulation ("free-market") largely serves to concentrate wealth in a relatively small section of society. It's a natural function of the system. You can try to mitigate that by regulation, or you can try to remove capital from the equation by making sure that the means of production (which generate wealth) are commonly owned by everyone. That's communism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bumblebees don't generally live alone. In most species, the queen nests underground and will generate a colony of up to a few hundred daughter bees and drones. The queen hibernates over winter while the rest of the colony dies. She'll start a new colony when she wakes up.

Honeybees are fascinating, but so little is known about bumblebees (because their nests are so hard to find) that they're fascinating AND mysterious.

I thoroughly recommend this book on bumblebees - "A Sting in the Tale" by Dave Goulson

http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/A_Sting_in_the_Tale.html?id=MeKKfNsaWEEC redir_esc=y

Also, if you're interested in honeybees, "Clan Apis" by Jay Hosler is a really good graphic novel by a bee scientist.

<TEXT> It's apparently more likely that we are living in a simulation than that we are not. There have been a number of theoretical and philosophical arguments around this. The most developed is probably the Simulation Hypothesis published by Nick Bostrom which lays out the argument formally as follows:

"A technologically mature "posthuman" civilization would have enormous computing power. Based on this empirical fact, the simulation argument shows that at least one of the following propositions is true:

The fraction of human-level civilizations that reach a posthuman stage is very close to zero;

The fraction of posthuman civilizations that are interested in running ancestor-simulations is very close to zero;

The fraction of all people with our kind of experiences that are living in a simulation is very close to one.

If (1) is true, then we will almost certainly go extinct before reaching posthumanity. If (2) is true, then there must be a strong convergence among the courses of advanced civilizations so that virtually none contains any relatively wealthy individuals who desire to run ancestor-simulations and are free to do so. If (3) is true, then we almost certainly live in a simulation. In the dark forest of our current ignorance, it seems sensible to apportion ones credence roughly evenly between (1), (2), and (3).

Unless we are now living in a simulation, our descendants will almost certainly never run an ancestor-simulation."

(Copied from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis)

There is also the fact that there is a minimum size (the Planck Constant) for things in the universe (ie things are "quantised", from which we get "quantum mechanics") - this implies that that the universe could be mapped to quantised data.

There was a paper published recently that suggests that all physical simulations have distinct asymmetries and that if we can find those asymmetric characteristics in the universe, we would have shown that the universe is a simulation. The authors suggest measuring cosmic rays to look for these asymmetries.

<TEXT> Halo movie? You mean like Forward Unto Dawn?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_4:_Forward_Unto_Dawn

And Ridley Scott has been threatening to adapt The Forever War for the last few years.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Forever_War

Edge of Tomorrow has powered armour and possibly lots of bug-shooting, but I think its focus is elsewhere rather than on straight military scifi.

Having said all that, Forward Unto Dawn is hardly big-budget, and The Forever War seems to be stalled. I'm not sure the time is right for the powered armour bug hunt end of the scale. Our bogeyman for this decade and the last is more insidious (TERRORISTS!) than the Red Menace paranoia of the Cold War that spawned the great military sci if novels. Instead we get class war (Elysium) and militaristic all-is-not-as-it-seems manipulation (Oblivion and Ender's Game).

And for the record, Alien is emphatically not military. The whole point is that the crew of the Nostromo are working-class joes - "truckers in space" who argue about their bonus pay and bitch about their bosses. Aliens plays with  Vietnam War movie tropes, but not Alien. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The finite amount of em spectrum available is not going to cause really huge problems any time soon (for existing uses) as the compression technology gets better. This is why we're replacing analog TV signals with digital - you can squeeze a hell of a lot more into the same space. There is also a technique called multiplexing ("muxing") which carries multiple channels in the same signal by ordering packets. Your tuner knows that when you're watching channel 1 it should only listen to packet numbers 1, 7, 13 etc on a 6-channel mux. This is how satellite TV has always worked. The issue is that currently things like 4k and 8k channels sometimes require more bandwidth than the current infrastructure can stuff into one mux, which is why players like Google are investing heavily in compression technology as well as fibre - a new compression codec is hugely cheaper to roll out than a new internet backbone or satellite/receiver network. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of my favourite movie-going moments was while watching The Fellowship of the Ring in the Odeon Leicester Square (a really big auditorium) at the packed midnight showing on December 24th. When Aragorn beheaded the leader of the orcs, there audience went absolutely mental. Everyone was on their feet, screaming and shouting and punching the air. People were hugging. Shared moments like that are what make going to the cinema one of my favourite things to do.

Tangentially, we have an experiential cinema experience in London called Secret Cinema. It costs a fortune but you get really immersed in the movie - the staff are all actors in character and they recreate the whole environment. During their showing of The Shawshank Redemption (in a disused hospital made over as a 1920s prison), they passed out cold beers at the point in the movie where Andy wins his coworkers cold beers while retarring the roof. We were all in prison uniforms by this point and sat on folding chairs in the "prison gym" and suddenly, passing beers along the rows to one another, we stopped being individuals sitting in  a dark room watching a film, and started being a group of people sharing a moment together and - very effectively - with the characters on screen. It was one of the simplest and most powerful things I've ever experienced around film - a real moment of camaraderie, created out of very little, that really brought the film alive.

<TEXT> This thread is about films that are supposed to be great, but that one finds dull. How can you throw around absolutists like "it's certainly not boring" when boringness is inherently a subjective assessment? You find the film as interesting as any other fictional biopic; this poster (and I) find it dull. Get off his case.

FWIW, I think Citizen Kane is a fantastic example of meticulous film-making and the detail of the mise-en-scene displayed is phenomenal. The psychological realism in the character of Kane is fully-rounded and explored in distinct and identifiable stages as the narrative progresses with little deviation from a very solid structure. In many ways and in a number of dimensions, Citizen Kane is an excellent example of a disciplined and structured approach to character study in film and it is rightly considered a classic.

But I still find it boring as hell to watch, and no matter how much you might disagree with me, I'm not wrong in that.

<TEXT> They may not "say anything" but Bill Gold's original "cracked rock" poster for Alien is considered by many to be a design classic,  and it certainly did its job driving early audiences. I suppose real movie posters are marketing and these fan posters are art, but this particular one just annoys me - the facehugger wouldn't even fit through that hole!

I like these early designs more (from the book "Alien Vault" by Ian Nathan).

<TEXT> "Stereotypic" is not a word; and "stereotypical" doesn't mean what I think you think it means. Try "iconic". In fact, I'd consider using "horn blasts" rather than "BWAAs" too (note, no apostrophes in plurals!) :) 

If I were to offer any other advice (beyond the need to italicise your titles) I'd suggest you maybe take out the ships' names from the Star Wars paragraph. It feels to me like you're just showing off your geek knowledge, and I'm not even sure the names are in the film, so they don't really count!

Otherwise, this is a very good piece - your passion comes through and you come across as bright and engaged. I was in a similar position to you when I was your age. I wrote 1000 words on the first two minutes of Blade Runner - it got me in because I was passionate and engaged, just like you. So I hope it works out for you too. 

Good luck and let us know how you get on!

<TEXT> Okay, well to address your examples: Lawrence of Arabia is a "great" biopic because of an outstanding performance from Olivier, fantastic setting and cinematography, and it's just a plain old good story; Jaws is a "great" creature feature because Spielberg understands how to take a relatively niche genre and reinvent it as something mainstream, and because of the influence his techniques have had on that genre ever since; The Godfather is a "great" gangster movie because it's not really a gangster movie at all but rather a dynastic drama with a rich script and career-making performances.

Do you see my point? There are so many different criteria that you're going to find it very difficult to pick one and say "if a film does this it's great, and if it doesn't, it's not." Even with celebrated auteurs like Kubrick or Welles, their filmographies cover a wide range of genres and styles and it's problematic to try to reengineer a formula from them. That's why they are considered "great" film-makers rather than, say, talented genre movie directors (like Michael Bay or JJ Abrams who are both very good at basically one thing).

There's a difference between being able to make excellent movies of one type over and over again, and being able to take the language and technique of film and turn it to whatever aspect of human existence you want to explore.

But to get back to your original question regarding whether goodness/greatness is objective or subjective, I would suggest that this is generally a consensus play. Of course all art and entertainment is subjective. That's what the Artistic Bargain is all about - because it happens in your brain and the artist can only create the stimulus. You have to bring the response. But if enough people perceive that there is something special about a particular piece, that tends to become "considered great". 

And note that that consensus doesn't always get it right and often goes back and reconsiders because audience expectations change and it's sometimes difficult to spot what a truly game-changing film is doing until after the fact. Look at the original critical response to Alien, which was lukewarm at best, largely because most of the reviewers were not looking for a reinvention of tried-and-trusted b-movie/horror picture tropes. Now it's considered a seminal work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think your main issue here is what you mean by "good". Entertaining? Enjoyable? Exciting? Beautiful? Insightful? Passionate? Intense? Profound? Does it need an exceptional script, performance, cinematography, lighting, score, visual effect, choreography? Can a documentary be "good"? What about experimental, conceptual, abstract and non-narrative film?

I think one could build a good argument around a given film being objectively good/rich/effective/striking/successful etc. on any of these criteria, but just "good" is far too vague. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "...it's a dialect, and not an accent. The distinction is technical as well as political: Immigrants have accents, natives have dialects; an accent is something you try to lose, a dialect is something you use to define your cultural and geographical heritage. "

Uhhhmmmmmmmmmm no. A dialect consists in the words you use; an accent is the way you pronounce them. Pronouncing "man" in any way at all is an accent. Replacing "man" with another word (eg. "blood", "dude" etc) would be a feature/indicator of dialect. 

Both serve to define geographic, cultural and class identity. And both can be "lost" or "exaggerated" as situations require - for example it is often cited that women in groups of same-gender strangers will modify their accent and dialect towards the regional standard and "up" the class scale to enhance status, while men will modify away from the regional standard and "down" the class scale to achieve the same thing - the assumption (which I question) being that women want their peers to see them as sophisticated and men want their peers to see them as down-to-earth.

In any case, researchers would need to argue that eg. "mahn" is a different word from "man", with different etymological roots and connotative connections, in order for this particular set of linguistic features to be called a "dialect". I think that would be quite hard. </TEXT>

The helicopter shots from Kubrick's B-roll are in the Final Cut if I remember correctly (and I watched it on Sunday). Also, Scott claims he was totally onboard with the VoiceOver  after poor initial test screening feedback and gets upset when people say it was imposed by the studio. It was Ford who hated it (and is quite obviously phoning it in throughout).

<TEXT> Absolutely agree. However, there is the non-linguistic part of experiencing the experience (with its attendant emotions and physiological reactions etc) and then there is the conscious/linguistic act of recognising and accepting that experience. I was trying (and failing) to describe how I got around re-triggering or re-experiencing each experience by avoiding "describing" it to myself in too much detail in this second part. The goal is to merge the two together so that it becomes less a linguistic process and more a natural, non-linguistic process that happens constantly. However, that's quite hard to put into writing and certainly beyond me on this sub! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know that feeling, friend. You get into a cycle of self-hatred and you get depressed. Might be worth talking to a doctor about it if this is a regular thing or if it's getting more intense. A fix could be as simple as a diet change.

However, in the meantime, recognise that:
1) while you may be acting badly, at least you're aware of it. This is Step One for everyone.
2) if you're treating the people you love badly, at least you have people that you love. This is not something to take lightly. You are capable of love and you genuinely want to treat these people better. That's a good thing.

Also,  your quest begins when you consider that the thing that is undesirable is not you but your behaviour. And that is something that it's much easier to contemplate changing than changing you. Having these feelings and behaving like this have a cause somewhere - psychological, chemical, hormonal, spiritual, I don't know. But these causes are addressable. That's (at least part of) what mindfulness is. It's about knowing what is and accepting it - maybe with a view to improving or modifying it - rather than wishing it were otherwise and just futilely railing against it because it's not. 

Lastly, try having some compassion for yourself. Not feeling sorry for yourself, but compassion. Imagine that it was someone you truly loved who was behaving like this. How would you feel towards them? Would you still be able to see the person underneath? Would you still love them even if you didn't like their behaviour? Would you turn your back on them or see their anguish and try to help? You are just as worthy of your own compassion as anyone else.

NON-BUDDHIST PRO TIP: when you do something you're not proud of, don't think of it as bad/awful/despicable, but rather as "a step backward" along the path to stopping this cycle. It's a subtle thing, but it really helped me to think of these things as temporary stumbles or setbacks rather than stains that I will bear forever. Honestly, that's also a much more accurate way to view them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's an interesting reading. I do think I disagree with you though, and I'll tell you why: in the "first ending" you are identifying with the father very closely. You call out how brutal and shocking is the choice that the father has to make (I would call it a pragmatic choice rather than a moral one, though). But when you talk about the second ending, you have lost that identification and talk about it being all about "bad timing" as if you have stepped back out of the scene.

SPOILERS FOLLOW: Instead, I see the first ending as a tragic but pragmatic choice. They have given up hope. The mist goes on forever. They cannot survive. With only four bullets, only four of them can take the quick way out, so the father steps up and does the hardest thing - he shoots the other passengers including his son and steps outside the car to meet his fate, knowing that he has spared them the agony of being eaten or whatever.

But then he doesn't die. The mist clears. The soldiers turn up. The import of this is not that they all would have lived if he'd waited five minutes. The true horror is in the fact that he *now has to live with having killed his son*. He's never going to recover from that.

And if that weren't enough, we've also stepped from a nightmare world of monsters and violence where people killing other people is a matter of survival, back into the prosaic world where he hasn't just spared his passengers from a fate worse than death; he's just *murdered four people, including his son*. Here comes order and civilisation marching up the street. And that throws into sharp relief The Lord of the Flies -style breakdown of civilisation that took place in the supermarket and everything that followed. I think this is especially important when looking at the narrative that revolves around the crazy religious lady.

So, for me, the "Darth Vader scream" is the sound of the man he was realising the man he has been forced to become. It is the sound of his mind and soul irreparably shattering. And it makes the "first ending" even more brutal, shocking and brave by throwing it back into a naturalistic perspective. 

I think that was what Darabont was aiming for - to re-frame his essentially otherworldly/fantastical movie back into the real world and thereby shed a bright new light on all the hard choices he forced his characters to make, and in this particular case, to make those characters *own* the consequences of their actions. The Mist comes and the Mist goes - how do you live with what you did when it was here? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm in exactly the same place. You're doing better than me on one front; I am completely unable to meditate at the moment because of spiralling negative thoughts. I'll do anything to avoid them, ranging from calling my mother in tears late at night until I exhaust myself into sleep, or taking well-meaning friends up on their offers to get me drunk (which is ironic as I very rarely drink and the end of my relationship was largely due to my partner's drinking).

I have been beating myself up about it - I know this is not a productive path - but you know what? This is the way my mind is dealing with the hurt and grief. I'm not going to sleep for a while. I'm still going to see her out of the corner of my eye for a while. I'm still going to be imagining what she's doing and who she's with for a while. I can't stop these thoughts and the more I try, the worse they get. All I can do is be aware of them and understand that they pass away. This helps with the despair, but I just have to endure it all now. For a while.

It's called depression. It's not something you can just snap yourself out of by main force.

Also, it's ridiculously trite, but this actually (surprisingly) helps me: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-cVn_8MY0g </TEXT>

May I also add that Kaneda and Searle both mirror Pinbacker (a Dark Star reference in the name?) in that they all experience the overwhelming "sun-bathing" but interpret in 3 different ways - Kaneda appears thoughtful and rationally, intellectually analytical; Searle is overwhelmed by the emotional and psychotropic aspects and their effect on his identity; Pinbacker addresses it in religious terms. These are the three basic human responses to the unknown and correspond to left-brain, right-brain and pineal gland experiencing (cf: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotheology). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello all. On paper I'm everything you loathe - a spiritual atheist and Western pseudo-Buddhist who comes to the practice via Nichiren Buddhism. Worse, I freely pick and choose what suits me and I don't get hung up on what I don't yet understand. I'm pretty sure I don't buy into many of the aspects of karma and reincarnation that I see discussed on Buddhit and at my local SGI group, and I certainly don't believe in any gods or deities ... right now. That may change, of course.

I'm a former committed Christian with a degree in Biblical Studies (and another in Literature) who turned his back on that faith for very rational reasons and I emphatically didn't come here looking for a new religion, but rather a framework and kit bag of mindfulness techniques to help me manage my cyclical depression without medication. 

I'm used to being called a tourist and a dilettante by purists and it doesn't bother me very much any more. My practice *works*. I am a better human being now than I was before. My life is more enjoyable to me and I cause less suffering to those around me. What else matters? I'm about 18 months into this leg of my spiritual journey, and the paths I am currently treading are Buddhist in nature, that's all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, you're not, and it's a valid observation .... But all of the other kids are unpleasant caricatures, not just Chardonay - Jered calls Crispin's picture a "love letter to banality" which is not natural language for a little kid; one kid has a literal booger-head etc. They're not really like that, but that's how Clarissa's mind works now and we're seeing them through her eyes.

You're right that it doesn't sit well, but I think the writer is trying to show how different and separated from the other kids Clarissa feels. She's not a child anymore. She can't relate. She has nothing in common with them. So she sees them as stereotypes and caricatures. 

I don't think it's very obvious this early in the sequence and so it's easy to think that it's the writer trying to use racism for comedy effect.

I don't think there's any comedy intended here at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And oddly enough, he didn't write "Alien" either - Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett did. And neither PKD nor Scott wrote "Blade Runner". That would be Hampton Fancher and David Webb Peoples. And we all know that Scott didn't write "Prometheus" - the credit/blame for that is shared between Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof.

Seriously, if we're going to look for a common thread here, let's at least compare apples with apples. Scott's a director, not a screenwriter. And the question of who "owns" a film is not an easy one anyway. Is "The Shining" a Kubrick film, a Stephen King film, a Jan Harlan film, or even a Jack Nicholson film?

FWIW, my dissertation was on looking for an auteur common to all three Alien films (as they were at the time) in order to justify the position that they formed a complex (as opposed to compound) narrative. Closest I could get was David Giler and Walter Hill who produced all 3 (plus Resurrection and Prometheus later). Unfortunately, they had nothing to do with Blade Runner. Or Firefly, Soldier, Angel etc.

I thinking many cases it boils down to film-makers wanting to doff their caps to properties they like. Hell if I was making a scifi movie, I'd find some way to get a W-Y or a Tyrell logo in somewhere just because I think they're cool. When Scott reuses a couple of graphics, it's probably just for convenience. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your points are all completely valid. I guess my complaint is that - for me - the entire world was set up purely to bring about circumstances where he would have to choose between his own life and the greater good, and the elements of the setup were a little bizarre and arbitrary. Yes, I understand why Loopers would sign up for the program, but WHY would the powers that be put it in place? There is no advantage in it over getting someone else to do it, and that would be much lower risk. And it seemed - to me, again - that the TK McGuffin exists in an otherwise purely technological milieu JUST to provide a threat to society at large. It just didn't fit naturally.

But it seems I'm the only one who feels like this :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really? I think I saw a different film from the one you saw. The one I saw was trying to be a high-brow sci-fi character study which closed its own loop (see what I did there?) and therefore I would be very surprised to see a [good/worthwhile] sequel. Of course there is probably going to be a crap cash-in sequel, that being the way of the world at the moment.

My complaint is that the rest of the film seemed intentionally plausible - a near-future extrapolation of how OUR society would function with time-travel. Ad then they pasted TK in on top. For me it jarred horribly.

The other big issue is I see no reason why a boss would send an end-of-career Looper back to himself for disposal. Surely sending him to another Looper would make much more sense. But then they wouldn't be called Loopers and we wouldn't have a story.

It just all seemed so contrived to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't think of it as levels of reality, think of it as metaphor. Everything happens in the real world, but Baby Doll - mentally traumatised beyond coherence - "imagines" herself in different worlds in order to gain some power and control. In the club-world she is a rare "dancing" talent; in the fight-world a kick-ass ninja commando; but in the real world she is a powerless victim of some of the most horrific cruelty I've ever seen on film.

You can read the film as if Baby Doll teaches the other girls to do the same, or that it's just her and, since we see everything from her perspective, that's what's presented on the screen as reality. There's probably some deep insight about looking for "reality" in a flickering series of photographs on a screen, but there you go.

One could argue that this device provides a mechanism for the film-makers to explore the psychology of a victim of horrific abuse without actually showing the abuse and therefore without distracting the audience with cruelty-porn. I would suggest that it's not very successful at that on account of the violence-porn and the skimpy outfits... </TEXT>

That's how I can put up with guns like the M41A Pulse Rifle in "Aliens" - it's beautifully designed, looks the business, but has the illuminated round counter on the wrong side, facing the camera not the user. The reasoning is obvious and it also pales into insignificance when you notice that the shoulder-mounted lamps serve only to illuminate the actors' faces not what they're looking at. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd add Godspeed You Black Emperor to the list of post-rock, and I'd also suggest that film soundtracks can sometimes be a worthwhile addition to your ambient/downtempo collection, particularly:

Sunshine OST (Jon Murphy and Underworld)
Moon OST (Clint Mansell)
Monsters OST (Jon Hopkins) (for me, the nicest to listen to of all of these)
Book of Eli OST (Atticus Ross)

If you want something with a structure and beat to it without completely losing touch with the Brian Eno end of free form ambient, have a look at:

HECQ
Aes Dana
Minilogue
The Boats
The Field
Peace Orchestra

And if you like those, you might like Trentemoller, particularly "The Last Resort" (but it's too structured to meditate to). </TEXT>

I see a lot of benefit in the practice of Nichiren Buddhism and I see a lot of good intent in the SGI organisation, but I wonder if there's a natural tendency for humans to gravitate towards "creepy cultishness" (for want of a better phrase) in any spiritual organisation that promotes egalitarian values. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe Scott actively resisted putting the deleted scenes back into an "extended version" on the Blu-Ray/DVD and has said "there will be no Director's Cut - the theatrical release *is* the Director's Cut."

For my part, I literally cannot understand why they would cut those scenes. Not only can you see where the pure deletes have been crudely hacked away in the final version, but also every one of the deleted scenes that was replaced with something else was much better than what we saw in the cinema - especially when Mutant Fifield comes back, and the extended axe fight/chase between Shaw and the Engineer through the lifeboat, both of which feel much closer to the Alien films than what we're left with in the theatrical release. 

And many of those scenes explain some of the character oddities. For example, the angry make-up sex scene between Holloway and Shaw explains why he's so depressed and turns to drink ("We came to *talk* to them!"), and the extended scene with Vickers and Weyland contextualises that stentorian "...father!" that stands out so badly in the final edit.

Still no explanation of why an exobiologist would be afraid to examine an alien corpse, but would try to tickle an obviously aggressive alien snake-thing. Or why "I'm here for the money, not to make friends" Fifield is suddenly smoking weed in his helmet. Maybe that's why he got lost, even though he's the mapping expert...

The most telling change IMHO is the final sequence of Shaw recovering David's head and body. In the final release she actually apologises for zipping his head up in a bag ("I'm sorry," she says. "It's quite alright," he assures her). This is the [artificial] person directly responsible for the horrific death of her partner, her alien pregnancy, the death of the entire crew, and for putting the whole Earth at risk, and she apologises tenderly for bruising his dignity?! On at least a couple of occasions, he's gone out of his way to cruelly and personally torture her about her father's death, for god's sake! In the deleted scene, she picks him up by the hair, calls him a "fucking robot" and shoves him, protesting into the sack. Much more believable.

"Deleted Scenes Shaw" is way ballsier than the one we see in the theatrical release, almost a worthy successor to Ripley. Almost.

Can't wait for the inevitable fan edit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It originally came from the expense of making film reels for cinema exhibition. The distributor would print so many copies of the film and use them for the US theatrical release, then pack them up and ship them to Europe. After the European run, the reels would be distributed to the Far East and South America. This is where we get the Region 1/2/3 thing on DVDs and it has screwed up the gifts management side of things no end as we move towards 100% digital distribution.

Today, it is a way to optimise marketing spend. Global campaigns are very expensive and a staggered release means the distributor can manage spend on a territory-by-territory basis based on the performance of the film in previous territories. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fincher distanced himself from Alien3 because he felt that the studio screwed him in the final edit. That's why there is no director's commentary available. There is, however, a Director's Cut which is a much, much better film. Apart from a few script changes and deleted scenes, the majority of the difference is in the pacing and it's incredible how much difference it makes.

Having said that, it is still a problematic addition to the franchise. But it's not bad, and it does bring a new dimension to the saga. Without spoilering, I think the final scenes would have been a fitting conclusion to the Alien story and you would be missing out if you ignored it.

TL;DR: Alien, Aliens, Alien3, Prometheus and [Prometheus' untitled sequel]. That's the Alien canon as far as I'm concerned. Ignore anything with a Predator in it and Alien Resurrection is an abortion. </TEXT>

If you file a Significantly Not As Described (SNAD) dispute, you will not only get your money back, but you will get the seller banned for selling counterfeit goods  - and you owe that to the community.  

Also, in future, if you pay with PayPal even off eBay you get buyer protection which means that even if the seller runs off with your money, PayPal will refund you at their own expense as long as the seller has lied to you (ie said it was legit but sent you a counterfeit/pirated item).

<TEXT> I agree with you to a certain extent, but I think the satire of the original is a comment on consumerism. It's about a man being turned into a product, and that's why it's important that the costume looks like a man-shaped machine, not like a man in a suit.

It would be interesting to see that same commentary updated to today as consumerism is still a huge issue. However, the costume looks like a man in a suit and all the comparisons in this thread are giving us men in suits - Iron Man, Batman etc. etc. So I'm not convinced they're pursuing the same themes. If they are, the costume looks like a failure. 

I understand they have also changed the company name to OmniCorp, from OCP (Omni Consumer Products - the clue is in the title, people!) so I think that hints at moving away from the consumerism angle.

Anyway, I'm withholding judgement until I actually see the film. These iconic characters are our modern fairy tales and are open to - and benefit from - reinterpretation. It will be interesting to see what a second take - without Verhoeven's obsession with pornographic violence and ridiculously overblown pastiche/satire - brings to the RoboCop myth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me, it was Joaquin Phoenix's reaction. As far as I'm concerned, M. Night Shayamalan's shtick is not having a twist ending (I think he kind of got pressured into that after The Sixth Sense), but rather taking fantastic situations - ghosts, superheroes, fairy tales, the-creature-in-the-woods and of course alien invasion) and playing them for real. How would you react if you began to believe you were actually a superhero? What would go through your mind if you saw actual evidence of alien invasion on the news? His strength is showing those reactions in a very naturalistic and human way. And Phoenix's wide-eyed shock brings it home - think of the implications of what he's seeing: All bets are off and the world as we know it could literally be coming to an end right now. Terrifying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, the accent is referred to as "Received Pronunciation" or "RP".

"BBC English" and "The Queen's English" are colloquial terms for "Standard English" which is a language. "American English" and "International English" are language variants or (less accurately) dialects. These terms refer to the words used - and by extension, their spelling - not the way they are pronounced.

There is (technically) no such thing as "British English".

Many East Coast US accents are often said to be "closer to the original accent" than RP. This is because the language of the English Court at the time of the colonisation of North America had features like pronounced terminal "R"s and sharper "A"s. This change is not because of phonemic shift in RP, but rather because the Court moved geographically and so its prevailing accent changed. 

Terminal "R"s and sharper "A"s are still strong in accents from the North West of England (eg. Liverpool) and the West Country (eg. Bristol). It is no coincidence that these are areas where a lot of emigrants to the US came from, especially as Bristol and Liverpool have long been maritime cities.

The US fondness for removing "u"s and similar simplifications of spelling come from Webster's efforts to standardise the language, starting with "A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language" of 1806. You have to remember that the concept of "correct spelling" was even then still relatively new - prior to the mid C18th, pretty much any spelling was fine. People argue to this day about the influence of Puritanism and American experimentation in education on the formation of American English variant spelling. </TEXT>

IIRC, here are some key facts:
- the BEFORE and AFTER are usually taken in reverse order.
- someone who has high muscle mass and low fat can VERY quickly put on "bloat" in the space of 3 or 4 hours by eating high salt snacks and drinking sugar-laden drinks.
- camera angle, lighting, fake tan/whitener, and baby oil are all used to define or conceal contours
- there is a legal requirement* that the model has actually taken part in the advertised program (or used the supplement, followed the diet etc) unless there is an on-screen disclaimer to say otherwise. However, there's nothing to stop you hiring a body-builder, bunging him or her a box of your snack bars and then claiming your conscience is clear. And there's no requirement to prove that the BEFORE and AFTER are actually taken before and after.

* Or advertising regulatory requirement. In the UK. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not an expert, but my tuppence-worth: isn't there a difference between an injured being and one that is helpless and in the actual process of dying? There was a post the other day about a poisoned rat dying in agony and confusion and my internal reaction was, "well if that was me, I'd want someone to kill me quickly." I know, I know: unjustified anthropomorphism, but I naturally approach compassion from an empathetic direction. 

Anyway, my point is that the rat would die within agony-filled hours or days anyway and nothing could alleviate its simple physical suffering save euthanising or possibly anaesthetising. The bird could be nursed, its injuries treated to make it more comfortable, and food and water could be provided to keep it alive. In this way, its suffering could be relieved while maintaining its life. The rat's could not.

This opens a whole can of worms for me. Is euthanasia ever justified for dying, agonised creatures (and humans)? Where do we draw these lines? What about medically extending the life of a creature or human who is suffering agony? Is "withholding treatment" to "let nature take its course" just copping out? What about the patient's wishes - if the rat could talk and were pleading for an end to its pain, should we ignore it? The whole gamut of Medical Ethics lies spread before us.

I'm not sure whether it is "right action" or not, but faced with a creature suffering like this bird, I would first assess its condition to see if I or anyone else could relieve its suffering without harming it, but if that was not possible, I would end its life humanely. I understand the "existence is suffering" point and the analogy of killing a child to prevent future suffering, but I'm simply unable to see myself just watching a creature suffer its way to death for hours and then afterwards sitting back and thinking, "well, existence is suffering, and the suffering-density over time is irrelevant, so I did the right thing there." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with you up to a point, but one of the better aspects of the prequel duels is that they actually use different styles. Now, I'm not in any way saying that their styles are actually based on real-world systems, but Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan use ELEMENTS of Italian and German longsword techniques, Dooku's style owes SOME of its distance-closing and cone-of-defence moves to Capo de Fero style rapier, etc. I only catch glimpses of it, and 99% of the "systems" are made up to make the fights look good (as is absolutely right), but it's there. And I study Western Martial Arts (read: medieval sword fighting), so I'm not picking up on a lot of the Eastern influences, I'm sure - Ray Park is a renowned Eastern Martial Artist, so I'm sure his techniques are influenced by Eastern staff and single-handed sword disciplines. And Yoda's constantly-moving technique reminds me of capoeira for people with tiny arms and legs.

It's like they moved from, "Let's have two guys smacking crap out of each other with lightsabers ... but on different obstacle courses," in the originals to, "Let's have two guys smacking crap out of each other with lightsabers ... but with different styles." Which is like an evolution from swashbuckler to actioner, or from samurai movie to Kung-fu movie, I guess.

It's pretty thin and it could have been so much more, but I still maintain it's there. One of those good ideas drowned in fluff. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only prequel scene I really liked was the final battle between Darth Maul and Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. The physical characterisation when they are trapped by the barriers is great - Qui-Gon sits and meditates, Obi-Wan hops from one foot to another like a worried child, Darth Maul prowls like a caged predator. Apart from that 30 second sequence though, it's all entertaining fluff. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me too. I have come to realise that I have become very attached to being "the generous guy" and it manifests in ridiculous and pointless ways (like handing out hundreds of pounds worth of glow sticks for free at music festivals - what a waste!). However, I recognise this, but I don't beat myself up about it. It's a phase on my journey and it will pass, and it's a step up from being selfish. It does bother me that if I was really trying to increase happiness and reduce suffering, there's so much more that I could do with the 150 I blew last weekend than giving a couple of hundred people something to wave around for an hour or two.

Did meet loads of people I never would have talked to otherwise, and I got some cool photos! :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree with you on the point about good writing carrying poor direction and production, and so does Joss Whedon: 

Screenwriter Joss Whedon was unhappy with the final product. When asked in 2005 how the film differed from the script he had written, Whedon responded:
"It wasn't a question of doing everything differently, although they changed the ending; it was mostly a matter of doing everything wrong. They said the lines...mostly...but they said them all wrong. And they cast it wrong. And they designed it wrong. And they scored it wrong. They did everything wrong that they could possibly do. There's actually a fascinating lesson in filmmaking, because everything that they did reflects back to the script or looks like something from the script, and people assume that, if I hated it, then theyd changed the script...but it wasnt so much that theyd changed the script; its that they just executed it in such a ghastly fashion as to render it almost unwatchable."[26]

(Talking about "Alien Resurrection" - extract from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Resurrection)

For my money, excellent performances, direction, editing and cinematography can carry a less-than-stellar script. But if they're not up to scratch, the best writing in the world won't save the film.

For truly great cinema, it all needs to come together. Writing, direction, performance, score, set design, costume, lighting, effects, cinematography, editing, post-processing, even the marketing and presentation. </TEXT>

It's surprising how much you can write about a shot of a reflection in an eye (whose eye?) when you can talk about scopophilia, the cinematic gaze, audience identification points, the concept of individual versus omnipresent point-of-view, Freudian criticism's view on eyeball imagery and "the window to the soul" when the possessor of the eyeball may or may not be artificial and therefore without a soul, the mirroring of reflecting eyeballs in Rachel, Roy and the owl in later shots etc. etc. etc.

Writing about BR is fun and relatively easy, because there's so much packed into it that you can basically explore what you want.

<TEXT> Well I'm not sure on the distinction between "would be better" and "should play him", but I disagree with you entirely on the tough guy thing. It's hardly a rich literary masterpiece, but much of the point of MacLeod is that he's an ordinary guy who has immortality thrust on him (there's a whole scene where he asks Ramirez "why me?"). It has good points and bad points, but it's mainly a curse - he's almost burnt at the stake, he buries everyone he loves, and we see him go through various stages of dissolution in the flashbacks.

The tough guy is the Kurgan, who is also much of the reason MacLeod stays alive - to prevent the Kurgan from taking the Prize and to exact his revenge for the rape and murder of Heather. (The rest of the reason is that he thinks the Prize will give him a mortal life at last.)

MacLeod is a competent swordsman because Ramirez teaches him. But it's skill and smarts, not toughness.

I have not seen Tristan and Isolde, and I'm not doubting Franco's acting prowess (27 Hours was brilliant and he was brilliant in it). I just think he's too likeable to play a thousand-year-old, world-weary, slightly paranoid immortal with a revenge fixation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Irish accent? Have you actually seen "Highlander"? Quite apart from the Highlands being in Scotland, the original Connor MacLeod ("M'cloud") was played by Frenchman Christopher (Christophe) Lambert. And then there's this bit of dialogue:

COP: You talk funny, Nash. Where you from?
MACLEOD: Lots of different places.

But anyway, two problems with your suggestions. One, MacLeod has been alive for a thousand years and carries the weight of all the questionable things he's seen and done. Franco would be perfectly capable of carrying the role, but he's too much of a nice guy. There needs to be some ambiguity there.

Two, he's not a tough guy. He's an ordinary Joe and the runt of his litter (a disappointment to his family before they find out he's immortal). Hemsworth in Thor mode is completely wrong.

I think someone in the Reynolds-Norton-Bale continuum is spot on both physically and in terms of acting chops, and I look forward to them doing something more human with the character in the reboot than they did in any of the laughable sequels or in the schlocky TV series. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well the first point is that Blade Runner's negative reviews were often about the fact that so many questions were unanswered (the is-Deckard-a-replicant thing comes to mind but I believe that was later), not just because it was presenting scifi in a new frame.

For that you're maybe thinking of Alien's truckers-in-space compared to the squeaky-clean square jaws in jumpsuits of most of scifi cinema's history up to that point.

As for pointing you to the plates - well, are you considering that this is not the final chapter? Scott has all but announced another film (following Shaw and David to the Engineers' home world) and there have been rumours of Prometheus being the first part of a trilogy. So maybe expecting all of the answers now is premature. Instead, read some of the discussions around how Shaw compares to Ripley, whether Vickers is an android, the differences in the way the mutagen works in different contexts etc etc etc. There's a lot of stuff that it's interesting to think about.

Everyone has their own point of view. And it's fun to discuss them. Without arguing, of course.

For example, I find it interesting that everyone accepts that the vases are WMDs intended to wipe out earth. In fact, it's only Janek who puts this idea forward as his interpretation. Could be something completely different. Everybody just takes it as read, but Scott is perfectly capable of using a bit of misdirection.

I also like to think about David's shifting motivations. It's easy to write him off as utterly loyal to Weyland and his programming, but he's pretty much the centre of the film and probably the most likeable character (we're supposed to feel sorry for him when Holloway and Weyland insult him). So when he appears to be cruel or emotionless or selfish - what if that's hinting at more complexity rather than just being bad writing? Is there a framework where his seeming cruelty to Shaw on the diagnostic table fits in with his android nature? How exactly would an artificial intelligence with an "understanding" of emotion view organic life? Is he capable of jealousy? 

Where Roy Batty and the Replicants of Blade Runner are children in grown bodies, and Ash is the Company Man in robot form, David can be seen as Weyland's adolescent son. How does that inform his doping Holloway's champagne?

Interesting, no? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry that this argument irks you, but I didn't say that it was because Prometheus and Blade Runner are by the same director; I said that it's because they both have the same kind of ambiguity-on-first-viewing that leads to a lot of discussion and repeat viewing and that that then reveals a vivid, rich and internally consistent fictional world.

And that's not including the obvious thematic connections (both are about characters trying to reach their maker because they want more life). So no. Not "just" because it's the same director. Scott's three scifi films are very intimately linked.

Some people just want everything wrapped up nicely and handed to them on a WYSIWYG plate. Others want some more depth and actually LIKE discussing different interpretations of that ambiguity. If you're part of the former group, maybe just realising that other people are discussing something they are interested in without actually trying to argue with you (instead of getting "irked" or "bugged") might go a long way.

Now if you're not turned on by discussions of why Scott treats his android characters in Alien, Blade Runner and Prometheus as if they were more emotionally complex than his human ones; or how in all three films he plays with gender roles, rape imagery and perversion of procreation/parenthood/development; or how characters  in all three films seek to manipulate and are manipulated by a faceless corporation, even those who think they are calling the shots ... Well, maybe you could just recognise that people who are see Prometheus as more engaging than you found it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> OP, you make the point over and over again that you're disappointed that Prometheus "didn't explain anything." What exactly would you have liked it to explain?

Various people have posted here saying that the point is that it DOESN'T answer many of the questions that it raises, and that is WHY there is so much discussion about it.

Incidentally, many of the same accusations were levelled at Blade Runner (released 30 years ago today). It was panned by critics but is now considered a classic, in both cases precisely because of the seeming ambiguity which is layered on top of a rich, vividly realised and internally consistent fictional world.

Also, in both Blade Runner and Prometheus, part of the attraction is not WHAT happens, but HOW it is shown. Both films have fantastic cinematography and attention-to-detail in the set design, costume, effects and mise-en-scene which are all too rare in scifi cinema. 

Perhaps some people like it because it is beautiful piece of film-making. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi brother. A lot of people have been focusing on the "penis" part of this, but I'd like to focus on the "depression" part. I experience the same self-hatred around my own reasons. Fortunately for me, my bouts of depression - although very intense and regular - are very short-lived (about a week every six or eight weeks). I feel for you having a long period of depression. That must be so hard.

For me, when I am depressed, my Practice goes out the window. When you hate yourself, it's very difficult to find the energy to try to improve yourself, and when your mind is filled with that, there's not much room for anything else.

I find that it helps me to identify the depression as something that happens to me, not something that defines me. I know that when I'm depressed I say and do things that I would never do or say outside of the depression - it's like a different person is living my life. I almost think of it like being a werewolf or the Hulk or something (not really, but it can be a helpful concept to help me step back a bit). When people say "I'm sorry I did/said that - I wasn't feeling myself", I think that's what they're getting at.

For me, dealing with this side of my life started with recognising that it was a problem. That helped me start to "accept" that I was struggling with depression (rather than "suffering from" it) and that it was okay for me to have this problem - it doesn't make me weak or a bad person, it's just one of the things I have in my life, and everybody has something. It's good to see that's the stage you are at - you're on the right path.

Practice does help a lot ... if you can practice from inside the depression you're doing very well.

I would humbly suggest that you need to see a therapist (which you're doing) to help you work through the depressed thoughts, and you also need to see a medical doctor to make sure there isn't an easily-fixed hormonal or chemical side to it (the depression part, I mean, but a doctor may be able to help you with your penis issue too).

In any case, I wish you strength and good fortune in dealing with this, and I will remember you in my own Practice. I hope this post in some way helps you realise you're not alone at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can see that this is going to be something I won't be able to rationally internalise from Reddit posts! 

I think part of the issue is language - we say "this happened to me," so that kind of pushes us towards seeing "me" as the subjective consciousness, thoughts-and-memories, or witness that experiences and remembers the event. I certainly see "me" as the witness/experiencer - not necessarily the thinker but the thing that experiences thinking.

If I understand you correctly, this experiencer is part of Me in the same way that my physical brain, endocrine system, sense organs etc. are also a part of Me. There is, presumably, another component which is the "life energy" previously mentioned.

I can see how reincarnating life energy + experiencer would be reincarnating Me, but I guess I need to meditate long and hard on grokking how reincarnating JUST the life energy relates to Me.

Thank you very much for your thoughts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is that facetious? Upvote anyway.

To answer your question, it's a self-referential system so being aware of being aware of being aware is the same as being aware of being aware...

Or to lift an analogy from Terry Pratchett, it's awareness all the way down. :-)

Or again, you could look at it like this: I am the thing that perceives my mind working. For "I think, therefore I am" to work, "I" have to be aware of thinking. </TEXT>

Well, no I am not my body. I have a body, but I am not it. I could imagine having a different body, but I could not imagine having a different me. I can rationally think, "Why am I in this body and not yours?" but it is meaningless to think, "why am I me and not you?"

(The whole all-your-atoms-are-different thing, by the way, strikes me as being as empty as Theseus' Ship (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus). I get the point about impermanence, but that's not the same as denying continuity. And although the material components of my body may all have been replaced, it is still by definition, my body.)

I totally understand that I am a noob at this and maybe shouldn't expect to get my head around things straightaway, but I find reincarnation explained as some nebulous "life energy" being reused is about as meaningful as saying the water in my cells will be reused so therefore my cells are immortal. That's water (life energy) being indestructible, not my cells (self) being reincarnated.

In my current world view, my self is the most fundamental identity. All phenomena are divisible into two categories: me and not-me. I understand rationally the concept of interconnectedness with respect to the simultaneity of cause and effect, etc., but that's still me being connected to not-me. And when me dies and the life energy and component atoms which powered me and made up me's body are reconfigured into a new life, that new life belongs to not-me.

I'm not sure if I'm even making any sense any more...  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I struggle with this. To me, "I" am my subjective consciousness. "I" am the thing that is aware of being aware. If the thing that is reincarnated is not aware of being reincarnated (has no memories of being me), how is it me?

Or to put it another way, identity is not the same thing as material. The recycled toilet paper I used just now is not the Complete Works of Shakespeare in which the fibres were previously a component. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a newbie to SGI too - about six months of practicing - and its good to hear someone else has the same reservations that I do. The person who introduced me took me to visit SGI UK headquarters at Taplow recently and, while everyone I met there was very nice, I couldn't help but find it a little "cultish" and therefore unsettling.

Perhaps I should expand. I'm a former Christian with a degree in Biblical Studies who toured with a Christian rock band in my youth. I really walked the walk. About fourteen years ago I lost my faith and became an atheist, but I still respect others' right to practice religion as they see fit; I'm just not in the market for a new religion myself. I find the practice of Nichiren Buddhism has very tangible benefits for me, some of which I can find rational reasons for, some of which I am currently filing under "selection bias" or in some cases "beyond me right now but I can see myself reaching a point where I understand it". The doctrine that I find irrational or superstitious, I file under "well you're free to believe that, but it's not for me." I'm open to there being a "yet" on the end of that.

But having been brought up a Methodist, I have a very highly attuned cult detection faculty (it's a big part of Methodism). When people tell me to think, believe or do something and worry about understanding it later, I smile, nod politely, and back off. This skepticism is maybe counter-productive in some cases - for example, I refused to chant until I understood in English what I was being encouraged to repeat, and even something as basic as the "nam" part of "nam myoho renge kyo" wasn't something I was comfortable with in my first meeting - in the same way I don't sing hymns or recite the prayers when I attend a Christian wedding for example.

My take on this is that I am on my own personal journey. The sutras and other teachings - and the insight of my friends in my local district - represent a fabulous wealth of wisdom for me to draw on, but they have no meaning for me until I can internalise and understand. I recognise that my understanding will grow with time, and my attitude to particular aspects might even reverse completely - like my attitude to the central doctrines of Christianity did. But for now, I don't internalise what I see as some of the more superstitious aspects. I am very grateful that in my local district I feel very free to do that and to discuss it openly - the polar opposite of my experience as a Christian.

So I think the bottom line is that I identify as a Buddhist on the basis that I am practicing Buddhism, not because I am a member of an organisation. I certainly don't accept any responsibility for, or identification with, ALL of Buddhism. And I don't share many of the views of some of my Buddhist friends.

Perhaps it is relevant that I haven't so far felt ready to accept the Gohonzon, so maybe I'm just a "tourist" or not "really" a Buddhist at all in some people's eyes. But again, there's probably a "yet" on there. I'm cool with that and in my district they are too. But at SGI Taplow and with the quite zealous lady that first introduced me... well I didn't feel that expressing my reservations would be accepted quite so readily. My reaction to that is, "whatever" and a shrug. Maybe some would argue that I'm holding myself back on the path to enlightenment, but it's a journey not a destination and I'm in no hurry.

Anyway, I hope you continue to find benefit from your practice and I hope you can feel free to reject or at least not identify with what doesn't resonate for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. You're confusing producers and consumers. Producers aren't freetards; consumers who believe they have a right to consume the product of other people while denying those people the right to make a living are freetards. 

Many people choose to give their work away for free, and that's great. But it's their choice to give it to you without expecting anything in return.  You have no right to take something that is not offered to you free. How dare you make that decision for someone else?

If you choose to live outside the monetary system, then good for you. But if you think you can take my work - which I put my heart, soul, blood, sweat and tears into - and then tell me that I have no right to expect you to pay for it  just because it happens to be digitally transmitted ... well that's not a moral position. That's bullshit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you honestly believe that everything that can be digitally communicated is nothing more than "information" and that "information" should not have a price, then go ahead and spend your entire career - 80 hours a week plus, for the rest of your life - creating content and giving it away for free. I'm not talking about Creative Commons, I mean literally giving it away for free and refusing all donations or offers of tangible support. Then I'll listen to you. 

I'll listen politely when you talk about the value of art being zero and how all creators should be destitute and penniless. And then I will laugh in your face.

But I bet you're not doing that. You're just bleating about having to pay for your video games, music and movies, and that makes you a freetard. And as we all know, freetards fuck it up for the rest of us.

The ONLY moral position on this issue in a society based on exchange is very simple: IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO PAY THE PRICE ASKED, DO NOT CONSUME THE PRODUCT. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hard sci-fi, as in being largely about the science? Try "Primer" and "The Andromeda Strain".

"Contact" deals with alien contact from first principles, but ends up being largely about Jodie Foster reconciling with her dad.

"Red Planet" and "Mission to Mars" deal with space flight in a semi-realistic fashion. So does "Sunshine". If you have any interest in philosophy or religion, watch "Sunshine" as an exploration of Spiritual Atheism vs. hardcore Monotheism.

<TEXT> Monsters (2010) . Don't be misled by the title or the marketing. It's a very smart movie about human relationships against a background of alien creatures in the Mexican jungle.
Primer (2004). A very cerebral film about a tech startup in a guy's garage that stumbles on something extraordinary and trippy.
Ink (2009). More fantasy than sci-fi, but one of the most visually creative films I've ever seen. I bet you you'll live it if you loved Moon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Where it takes place matters not at all. I did my dissertation on "The role of memory in Psycho and The Shining" and my thesis on "Narrative Analysis and Auteur Theory applied to the Alien Trilogy" (peaked to soon - this was pre- Alien Resurrection and I've got a feeling Prometheus might change my conclusions) at Sheffield University, if that means anything to you.

I agree that there are some thematic (eg. sublimation of sexuality, and rape) and even structural similarities between Alien and Psycho, but no more than between Alien and, say, Home Alone. And to call that a "reference" or a "subtle connection" is, IMHO, unjustified.

If you are interested in close-reading Alien, a good place to start is "Alien Zone: Cultural Theory and Contemporary Science Fiction Cinema" ed. Kuhn, Annette; Verso, 1990. I don't have a copy to hand so I can't give you specific essay titles. There's also "Working Girls: Gender and Sexuality in Popular Cinema" Tasker, Yvonne; Routledge, 1998 and "Spectacular Bodies: Gender, Genre and the Action Cinema" Tasker, Yvonne; Routledge, 1993. I'm not such an expert on Psycho, but I'm sure you can find relevant material in any good analysis of Hitchcock. Your library will be able to help.

Anyway, good luck with your course, sincerely. Unless you're recalling from a while ago, in which case, hope it went well! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mmmmmmm, no.  The Alien is faceless (the lack of eyes forces us to look it in the teeth) and is a force of Nature, yes; but Norman Bates is a sick young man and in the final shot, a victim who wears his mother's face. The crew of the Nostromo are motivated by survival; Arbogast et al are motivated by solving the mystery and finding the missing girl. Alien uses a mix of cinema verite  (unscripted dialogue etc) and B-movie (cat-scare) techniques; Psycho uses noire (lighting/cinematography and detective tropes) and pure Hitchcockian ones (eg. the red-herring of the stolen money, shadowing in the shots of taxidermy etc). There is a Freudian aspect to both, but it is body-horror fear of (male) rape and impregnation in Alien and some form of Oedipal arrested development in Psycho.

I suppose you could argue that they're are both Haunted House narratives, but that's more a common genre than any direct connection. </TEXT>
