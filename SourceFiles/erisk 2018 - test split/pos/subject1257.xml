<TEXT> Ugh, I'm sorry Jina... We also got bad news regarding an SA recently but all we got was the lab results, with 1% normal morphology and a "comment" that read: teratozoospermia. So now we're waiting for my SO to meet his GP to see what he says next Tuesday, then we have our first appointment at a fertility clinic on May 23rd, and like you, I have no idea what to expect between " It's not so bad and can be fixed with vitamins etc" or "IVF with ICSI is your only option"... :(
I hope you get better news next time..

u/HermesHippie I'm still new to MFI stuff, what do you mean when you say morphology is trickier than other metrics? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Aww I totally get you... I also held off on running and signing up for races thinking I'd be pregnant, but that just made it doubly worse when race day swung around, I was out of shape and NOT pregnant... so I started doing the opposite haha, started up again and signed up for 4 races of varying lengths this season (so far), the last one being my second half-marathon at the end of August. This way I have a goal that makes me feel good when TTC ain't going so well, and "worst-case" scenario, I get pregnant and have to sell my bib! I try to see it as a win-win...

I wish you the best of luck and honestly, running feels so good for clearing your head, I encourage you to pick it up again :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ahhh crap that sucks... we're in a similar boat, my SO's first Sa came back with just 1% normal morphology, which equates with pregnancy being possible only with IVF and ICSI... however, all the ladies on here have said not to panic before getting more answers, and a 2nd SA, as numbers can vary quite a bit between 2 different SA's... SO has a follow-up with his GP next week which will hopefully give us some info, and then we meet an RE on May 23rd, which is when I'm expecting real answers and a game plan... which will hopefully not be straight to IVF. Add to that my shitty cycles and we're a fertility nightmare!

I wish you the best of luck and hopefully some positive answers with a 2nd SA!! Keep us posted </TEXT>

I'm 10DPO today and since getting the results from SO's SA last week (that weren't great), I just know that even though I managed to ovulate on CD50, there's like zero chance we can conceive without help, so I'm just waiting on my 16-day LP to finish :(

Nothing else happening this week, we start getting answers May 9th when SO has a follow-up with his GP regarding the SA result, then RE appointment on the 23rd. It seems like so far away. </TEXT>

How many IUI tries are you doing before moving to IVF? And how is this decided? </TEXT>

<TEXT> We got a kick in the gut yesterday... my SO got his SA results.... 1% normal morphology. I've just skimmed the surface of what that means, but it seems that we're definitely going to need intervention, and most likely IVF... he was so crushed, I didn't even have room to be crushed for myself yet because I feel so bad for him. All along my cycles seemed to be the problem and they're far from ideal, but I never would have thought that we'd be dealing with MFI as well. For now, all we can do is wait for the RE appointment on May 23rd, but I don't know what to think, what to feel... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for this. I'm also getting tired of bearing this alone and having found out yesterday SO's sperm is 99% abnormal, seems like we're far from out of the woods. TTC is hard, infertility is just plain inhuman and shitty. I refuse to stay silent in order not to make others uncomfortable. It's our reality now, and the more people are educated, the more they can be comprehensive and keep their shitty comments to themselves...

<TEXT> Ugh, if I had a dollar for each time I've been told that fucking sentence....

I've taken to launching into a fertility crash course to educate all these well-meaning but ignorant people. You can't get pregnant if you don't ovulate. You can't get pregnant if the sperm ain't good. The sperm needs to meet the fucking egg, which only appears for a few hours every MONTH (if you're lucky enough to have a regular cycle, not my case). Then I explain how temping and OPKs is not obsessing, it's giving me valuable information that so far has shown me I have ovulated exactly 3 times in 9 months. It usually shuts them up for a while lol </TEXT>

From what I know they're supposed to start treating at 4.5-5, and suggestion for TTC and 1st trimester are ever lower, at 2.5-3 as a maximum.

I so get you not being able to open your dang mouth in the doctor's office, been there done that and now I'm learning to better advocate for myself when I feel strongly about something. Good luck, I hope things get fixed for you! </TEXT>

I feel you on the baby shower thing... My best friend, who started TTC at the same time as me, is now 36 weeks pregnant. I absolutely did not feel up to the task of organizing a baby shower and it was months before I could be around her without wanting to curl up in a ball andd cry my eyes out. She's just the reminder of exactly how long we've been trying, and also the reflection of where I could be right now....

Anyway, nobody else stepped up for the shower so I ended up organizing the whole thing... And at the actual event, there were 3 babies under 3 months... That shit was hard, but I got through it despite how hard it was for me...

I think patience and forgiveness is a great mantra and I might be borrowing it from you :)
Hang in there and good luck </TEXT>

Did you go a whole year without a period since coming off BC? If so, I tip my hat to you, been off BC since August and cycles have been shit, but at least I've had 3 periods since then :/

I'm glad for you that your body seems to be getting it's shit together! </TEXT>

<TEXT> ... Stilllllll fucking WTO on CD42, so I've made myself a hell of a to-do list in anticipation of the Easter long weekend. I got a few small things done, mostly cleaning and putting away winter coats and boots (yay spring!), and now I have to motivate myself to work on my Master's...

Seeing my doctor on Tuesday and as always, stressed about it because I don't feel like she listens to me that much, I feel like she judges me because I'd like to know what the fuck is going on with my body, AND I want to ask for an extension of my work leave.... I'm going to practice hard advocating for myself this weekend, wish me luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Awww man that really sucks, I'm sorry he doesn't understand :(

My SO was a little bit like that in the first few months, telling me we should try to not take it too stressfully at first, saying it's normal it takes time... Fast forward to 8 months trying, only 2 ovulations, and his recent SA for which he has a follow-up appointment on May 9th (which might be because it wasn't great), he is starting to feel the discouragement and the sadness, and is now more understanding of how this whole TTC thing really is stressful no matter how hard you try to relax.

I hope you feel better today and that next cycle is your lucky one! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I've had 2 different rounds of bloodowrk done with nothing really abnormal, except my TSH which is too high for TTC and 1st trimester from what I hear, but my doctor won't medicate for the level I have... And I had 2 ultrasounds which were normal... Same here I have to wait but I'm asking my GP to refer me to a gyno or an RE so that I can get better answers soon.

My SO had an SA done recently and has a follow-up with his doctor about that on May 9th, which is too fucking far away, expecially since I'm afraid it wasn't great if he needs a follow-up appointment...

So it's all in the waiting, and I am not a patient person haha so it sucks real bad.. </TEXT>

Exactly, I don't get why they don't work to get it under control before pregnancy, especially as it's super important right at the beginning... It's not logical, sometimes it feels like all they want to do is push meds, and other times they won't fix something that is easily fixed... </TEXT>

My TSH has been at 3.7-3.9 since October and she insists that it's not cause for meds or a referral to an endocrinologist despite my Mom having Hashimoto's, my grandma having thyroid problems as well, me being extra-tired all the time and my cycles staying long and irregular, with 2 ovulations in 8 months... I'm getting pissed but feel pretty helpless as I don't know who to turn to next for medical advice... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I get it, it sucks.. Your temps are really nice haha I don't know if it's normal to be that steady, but a temp shift will be super obvious for you!

As for OPKs, me too, I do have a second line but it's always lighter than the control and it seems to just darken, then lighten, then darken again... I don't know what time is best to take it either so I usually do it between 12 and 4 p.m...

Anyway, hang in there and good luck!

I'll keep pushing for him to at least get a copy of the results this week... But I mean, if the results weren't great, don't they sometimes do a second test? If he needs to go back for a 2nd SA, shouldn't he go sooner rather than later? Or is it better to wait 2-3 months for the sperm to have time to generate a new batch?

Anyway, this whole thing sucks as I know you know, Coog. Thanks for the support </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sitting here on CD41 of cycle 4 still waiting to ovulate. 8 months in, that's not where I'd imagined I'd be. My doctor is so nonchalant, so I feel like I always have to push to get things to move... I'm going to have to beg for a referral to someone that will help me, because all my doctor does is say "we'll see how things go and if it's not regulating in a few months we'll do more testing".

SO went for an SA a few weeks ago and his doctor called for him to go see him to discuss the results... on May 9th. It's so far away, and I feel like if everything was perfect with his SA he wouldn't need to go back, right?

I'm feeling pretty bummed, because I know that my body is being an ass and I've expected that I'd need some intervention of some sort to ovulate properly, but I didn't think that he would have problems too, I sent him for an SA just to be sure that things were fine on his end.... Now I have to wait almost a month to find out what's going on with him :(

I don't have Hashimoto's (my mom does but was diagnosed after she had kids so I don't think it affected her when TtC), but my TsH has been running high for a long while, last number I got was 3.9 in February. But my doctor won't do anything about it despite my asking, even though I have only ovulated twice in 8 months... I'm going to ask for a referral to a gyno or an RE or an endocrinologist because it worries me, what if my TsH is part of the reason why my cycles aren't regulating?

<TEXT> Ugh, that sucks Coog. I'm sure you can get back on track with healthier eating :)

As for the LP, I totally get it. In the 2 times I've ovulated since August, my LP lasted 15 days, almost 16 (my period weirdly starts at like 10 pm). It just totally blows, especially when you've been waiting for so long to ovulate, then you need to wait even longer to get another shot when you know you're out :( Hang in there! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sorry you feel that way, it gets really hard sometimes... I haven't had as many cycles as you but I'm going on 8 months with nada, and a month ago got diagnosed with depression and given a month off work. The doctor also suggested we might want to put TTC on hold for a few months, which I refused to do. However, my approach since then is I'll keep temping and tracking but I will not obsess, especially as this may mot be the best time to get pregnant while I'm not at the top of my game mentally. I figure that whatever happens, I have to trust in life and that it'll happen when it's meant to happen. If we miss the fertile window this month, it just means another month of being just us, drinking wine with a sushi supper, and other "fun" things like that... 

I wish you a BFP real soon but most of all I hope you feel better really soon :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm thankful I had the guts to talk openly to my doctor about having a second month off work today. I'm feeling better than 4 weeks ago for sure but I'm really happy I get another 4 weeks to focus on myself and self-care and establishing healthy routines. Also SO for sticking with me, as well as my sister and close friends who have been so supportive. I haven't been as often on TFAB lately, but knowing all you peeps are here for support is great! I'm trying to take the more detached, less stressed approach to TTC, so keeping off TFAB for a bit is part of that, but I still love you guys :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's great :). My best friend is pregnant (on her first cycle trying, we started at the same time) and she's due in about 7 weeks... in the first months of her pregnancy I had all this sadness, grief and jealousy towards her (I'm not proud but it was so overwhelming) so I didn't really confide in her. Now I'm getting past that, and I'm learning to just open up and talk (about TTC but also about my emotions and stuff, depression diagnosis and all) and I've noticed it truly helps to open up, be honest and have people in your corner who really know what's going on. All my fears of judgement and feeling silly never came true, instead it just feels liberating. I'm glad to know you've got a great friend as well :) </TEXT>

We stopped Bc in August and naively assumed I'd get right back to ovulating and get pregnant within a few months... well, it took 5 months before I ovulated even once!! Right now, I've ovulated twice in 7 months, so yes it can take time even though I wish you the best of luck :)

<TEXT> Hi!! I've never managed to get a truly positive OPK, but the last 2 cycles I was getting close to a positive and BD'ed during that time, and sure enough, it coincided with the 1 day I had EWCM and a temp rise the next day. I get how you feel as peeing on 1-2 sticks every day for many days ain't fun, but for me it's 1 more sign to help pinpoint my O. Whatever you choose, good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everything here in Quebec is paralyzed due to the storm and the massive amounts of snow we got. I'm not working anyway, DH decided to work from home so we're going to have a little cocooning day, with lots of shoveling (there's over 2 feet of fresh snow and it's still falling!) 

On the TTC front, I'm on CD 13 so I've started POAS every day, since I don't know when I will ovulate... It was on CD 22 last cycle, but my cycles have been getting shorter each cycle so far so I don't want to take any chances. 

To all the ladies where lots of snow has fallen, stay safe!! As for me, I'm looking forward to some nice powder skiing this weekend :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can just add another "Hell no" to all the good advice these 2 ladies have given. Yes it's scary, yes it sucks that some people might be inconvenienced if you get pregnant at the same time, but it's YOUR LIFE. ask any of the ladies who have been on here for more than 2-3 months, and I don't think any of them would tell you to wait. This process is hard and cruel and can take months/years. It's your life, and if having a baby is a life goal then I think the rest will work itself out. 

Good luck.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow, thank you for all the advice and insight! I know that the list of potential side effects is always scary, but somehow it's just hit me hard this time. I'm giving myself a month to see if I'll get better without meds but will consider in 4 weeks according to my situation then. My doctor felt that TTC was another added source of stress and did mention that I was trying to do a lot all at once (which I kind of agree), but honestly for me right now, stopping TTC completely would be more stressful than just keeping at it in a non-obsessive way. Honestly the first 4 months of TTC were the hardest, but now I've just resigned myself that it will probably take a while and that it'll happen when it'll happen, but I can't bring myself to prevent it for a few months. Thanks for sharing your story, I wish you the best </TEXT>

Wellbutrin has been mentioned in a few comments, so I'll look into that. As for Celexa preventing you from orgasming, I've never been able to orgasm anyway so it wouldn't change much for me lol -_- but it would be disastrous if it lowered my (already low) libido </TEXT>

We decided to keep TTC, but without obsessing, because I can't stand the thought of completely putting TTC on hold. 

I do plan on getting outside and doing things I'd left aside, like reading for pleasure, regular yoga, drawing, and I'd like to pick up my guitar again (haven't touched it in over a year). I also need to decide what I want to do about my work vs. School situation and would like to work part-time until I finish my Master's (hopefully this summer), but for now I'm just trying to go with the flow and trying to find out what I really want.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks Madge. I'm currently seeing my therapist weekly, no group sessions, I don't know how I'd feel about that. As for self-care, I guess I'm learning how to do that as well, as my whole life had just been a series of to-do lists and activities and juggling a thousand projects. Definitely long walks outside with my dog, taking the time to just do nothing sometimes, reading all the books I've been meaning to, and taking the time for more yoga and meditation are definitely things I want to do. Small home projects also make me happy when I do them, so will be looking into that  

SO and I decided to continue TTC but without obsessing. The thought of putting a hold on it is worse for me than just continuing to temp and know what's going on with my body, with the expectation that it probably will still take a few months. If it happens it happens and I know I will be happy and will have a big positive to focus on, and if it doesn't happen then I'll just have more time to take care of myself and feel better. Either way I can't stand putting a definite hold on TTC. We'll see how it all goes... thank you for your kind words </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ahaha I love the bear of luck, it's perfect! 
And I've read that meds can make you sleepy and tired and stuff, and I can't imagine having less energy than I currently have. I wonder if I'd just sleep all day lol. 

I'm not sure how I feel about my therapist. She mostly listens and asks questions to get me to process my thoughts and come to solutions by myself, but I'm not sure if what we're doing is CBT or not, I'll try to see. 

Thank you for the support:)

<TEXT> It just scares me so much. Medication that acts on the brain is scary shit to me. I'm afraid it'll just make me numb and zombie-like and I can't deal with that. The side effects also seem worse than what I'm feeling right now. I know it's stupid and vain, but the weight gain I know I won't be able to deal with, it'll just make me feel worse. I decided I would take this month to see if rest can help me feel better on my own, and if it doesn't work then next month I will consider the meds (grudgingly)... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you :)

Actually, staying home alone sounds bad, but I really plan on taking this time to rest, sleep, eat well, and to really just take time for me: yoga, running, drawing, and home projects, as things present themselves. I've been a "to-do list" addict for too long and so I have to learn to just be in the present moment.

As for TTC, I cannot resolve myself to completely stop trying, but in the last month it has not been the major cause of my stress, so I think we will just keep on trying without stressing about it, even though I know the timing isn't the greatest. We'll see how it works itself out </TEXT>

<TEXT> I second Miroet. When I naively started TTC, I figured I would try to avoid holiday babies for the same reasons you mentioned OP. Fast-forward to now, although I haven't been at it nearly as long as Miroet, I have only ovulated twice in almost 7 months, so you can bet I will not be wasting any tries just to avoid potential due dates. I just want a baby, whenever that may happen. </TEXT>

By the way didn't mean to offend anyone with weight issues/prejudice, it's just that PCOS is so often represented with the typical picture...

I am definitely asking for more in-depth bloodwork, as I have doubts on my thyroid as well, which could be causing some of the similar issues </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well I did mention that I felt I had some symptoms in November. My doctor said I was really not a "typical" PCOS candidate but of course if things keep being iffy I might push a bit more. I'd have been more worried if my 2nd ultrasound had shown kysts as well but there was nothing. Also I know it's not always the case and that PCOS does not always correlate with obesity, but my BMI is like 21 which is probably partly why my doctor didn't immediately lean towards this.

But I will definitely keep an eye out for all symptoms. You didn't sound obvious, just helpful thanks :)

ETA: When you mention you changed your diet what did you do, was it keto or simply eating a bit more balanced/less sugar etc? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Woohoo! I was waiting for the Waiting Wednesday thread haha! So much waiting...

6DPO, waiting for symptoms, but mostly waiting for AF.. I know I'm being pessimistic but I just don't feel it at all. I don't even know if I'll bother testing, unless I feel very off, but that's hard for me to identify because I have zero symptoms before AF except bad cramps a few hours before it starts and I'm exhausted a day or 2 before. However, I feel like I've been exhausted for weeks now, so it's not like it'll change anything haha!

Man I hate waiting. Patience is definitely not one of my virtues...

ETA: I'm trying to ease the stress of the TWW with very low (read no) expectations, and also by stressing over my appointment with my doctor tomorrow! Man, brains are such assholes sometimes :P </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been lurking and commenting on here for a few weeks but never introduced myself... I was a little bit shy and intimidated TBH.

I'm only in cycle 3, but have been trying since August, so if you do the math my cycles are not regular at all so far... 

Cycle 1: 106 days anovulatory (that was such a loooong time to just wait for something to happen, anything at all), had an ultrasound around day 90ish which showed a 3-cm kyst on my left ovary. Bloodwork in November didn't show anything blatantly wrong, except my TSH was at 3.7, which I find a bit too high. I'm always tired with cold hands and feet, so I'll ask for a repeat TSH check soon.

Cycle 2: Had a repeat ultrasound in January (2 months after the first one), kyst was gone and there were no other kysts. This cycle lasted 56 days, and I ovulated on CD41 (yay!)

Cycle 3: Currently on CD28, 6DPO. My cycles seem to be shortening, which is good. I still feel like there definitely could be something off in my body hormone-wise. Since getting off HBC I've had really bad acne, oily hair, grown some new hairs on my chin and upper lip (FML). The 2 periods I've had were super short and light (2.5 and 1.5 days), my CM is almost always dry (I've had something resembling EWCM for barely 1 day both times I ovulated), never got a truly positive OPK despite peeing on about 50 sticks. So, despite me being only on cycle 3, I've got a feeling that this could take a while.

So, here I am, in that awkward stage between TFAB and stilltrying... I'm participating in both subs, but the fact that so many of the ladies who first welcomed me onto TFAB 3 months ago are on here made me want to follow.

Thanks for reading my book haha, and I wish all of you deserving ladies on here a BFP really soon :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It could be very variable coming off HBC. I personally had 106 days, 56 days, and now I'm 6DPO on CD28, so expecting a 36 day cycle. You never know how your body is going to function, but if you had EWCM then just to be safe I'd BD. Your CM can swing back and forth between EWCM and Watery/Creamy/Whatever. I can't rely solely on that because it's really not clear-cut. Also checking your cervical position really helped me, because even though I used a helluva lot of OPKs I never managed to get one truly positive in the both time I ovulated since August.

As so many have said on here before, "When in doubt, bang it out!"

The wisest words of TFAB. ;) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Haha! There are time like that, but the fact that we can laugh about it together then go on to have great sex on another night is what I love about our relationship.

Our worst time was last cycle when O was coming up, DH was leaving for a business trip for 3 days, so I wanted us to BD before he left. So I had an alarm set up for 5 a.m.... Needless to say I was half-asleep and not super into it, but we still tried for a while, when he went limp. I panicked, he felt bad, then he left.

Thankfully it was the only time that happened, but lesson learned: do not try to have sex when you're still sleeping!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep, I think you should wait a few days so that you're at least 7-8DPO. Seeing as you don't know when you did ovulate it's a bit harder. Do you temp? It really helps when you can see a thermal shift, even if it's not a big spike in one day (I get a rise but it takes a few days to go up). Whatever you do, remember you're not out until AF shows and I wish you the best of luck! </TEXT>

I really hope that you can make a decision that'll work for you.

The job I absolutely would like to have is going to become open sometime in May/June. It's at my old workplace, with whom I maintain a good relationship. Since I started TTC last August and haven't gotten pregnant yet, I'm just hoping that when they hold the interviews I'm not visibly pregnant as that would kill my chances. Seeing as it's taking a while, might as well get lucky with this job! On the other hand the one thing I want most in life is to be a Mom, but if I can get both the job and a baby in the near future it would be perfect.

I'd still feel bad taking the job then leaving on maternity leave not long after, but hey, that's life! </TEXT>

Assuming that I ovulated on CD22 (most likely but not 100% sure), we hit O-2, O and O+1. FF had at first predicted I O'ed on CD21 (pretty sure that was wrong), then that would have given us just O-1 and O+1..

Were your periods regular, or were they lighter than usual? I would think that a 30-day cycle would be ovulatory, but if you'd have had a super-long cycle followed by a really light period, then that might have indicated possible breakthrough bleeding vs. a "true" period </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi!

I'm in the awkward  stage in-between TFAB and stilltrying... In a similar situation to yours, I never had regular periods before starting HBC at 15, and when I stopped in August, it took me 3 months to get a period... I don't have PCOS (that I know of, my doctor seems to think I'm not a prime candidate for it even though I've got some symptoms) but my cycles are not regular at all. I never managed to get a positive OPK either thus far, but I've ovulated twice as shown by temp rises on FF. So we've had 2 "tries" in 6 months, and it's made me realize how quickly time passes and how much we want this.

I like that you've set yourself small, relaistic goals for 2017 :) Hopefully you can add a baby in there soon! I just wanted to say hi :) </TEXT>

I got off HBC in August and my cycle lengths were 106 days (no ovulation), then 55 days (with CD41 ovulation). I just ovulated on CD22 of this cycle, so just want to say hang in there, be patient and good luck!

I don't know where you are, but I know some doctors readily prescribe Provera to induce a period so you can at least start a new cycle without having to wait 100+ days.

Keep temping, keep talking to your body (haha! I hope mine wasn't listening to all the insults I gave it) and read all you can about TTC in the meantime :) </TEXT>

My recommendation for next cycle if you feel up to it temping. It's the only way to confirm that you did in fact ovulate and really helps to avoid this kind of guesswork.
Even if your cycle is usually regular, longer cycles can happen for many reasons. In any case, good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I never expected to feel that slump after a race (that went well!). It probably doesn't help that we started TTC in August, and so the *plan* was to take it easy after the race to concentrate on TTC... Well 6 months later I'm just out of shape, not pregnant! Lol. To top it off, my half-marathon buddy (best friend) was actually 2 weeks pregnant during the half (she didn't know it yet), and is now 6.5 months in...

Late December I got tired of everything being on-hold for TTC and signed myself up for a 5K in May, a 10K in June and another half in August (took advantage of early-bird rates haha). I almost regret entering just a 5K in May, a bigger mileage would have forced me to work out more to get in shape, but I feel so run-down that I was afraid I wouldn't even be able to do more than that.

As for food, planning is key. I just need to do those fool-proof tasty healthy recipes in my repertoire :) Congrats on the weight loss and staying healthy :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Haha, guys' metabolisms make me jealous sometimes!

Good idea on the small workouts! I bought an elliptical and was able to get on it about 2x/week for 2-30 minutes, then did a few exercices like squats, planks, etc, but we're finishing our basement, so it's folded up, and just needing to set it up each time is enough to stop me from actually doing it :( hahaha I suck :P </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ugh, I get you on the diet.

I'm usually one for doing about 80% healthy / 20% indulgence, and that works well for me, my weight is usually pretty stable and I've always been active. In May I left a job I hated, and turns out I hate my new job even more. Old job had a gym onsite, this one doesn't.

I ran my half-marathon at the end of August and I feel like I've been in a rut since then. Less exercising, more crappy eating, less motivation, more tired, etc. I get short bouts where I'll eat a bit better but I just feel like eating junk food all the time...

I've gained maybe 5 pounds (I know it's not so bad but it still pisses me off) and I just can't wait to find a bit more energy to actually work out more and cook better.

I'm glad you and DH have been motivating each other, keep at it! Truth is we feel so much better with healthy food :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is a 4-day LP possible? I've never seen that. I also think that doctors usually know what they're talking about but this situation is confusing to me...

OP, did you mention your super light periods to your doctor, did she say anything about that? I've also had periods lasting 2.5 and 1.5 days since getting off HBC with very little blood (still used tampons but they were never full). I'm seeing my doctor next week and will mention it, but I wonder what it could mean (I also have irregular cycles and don't seem to ovulate very well/very strong and sometimes not at all) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmm, your pre-HBC periods do not sound like they're regular... I'm just chiming in as someone who had stopped HBC 6 months ago and has only had 2 periods since, if you know your cycle is not regular it may be worth looking into stopping it in advance in order to give your body some time to adjust. Of course, talking to your doctor about other options with regards to antidepressants and other options for your skin is a must. You may also want to mention your irregular cycles and your doctor might want to do a few basic tests to see if there is anything that could be causing that and be easily fixed. In any case, good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I always knew I wanted kids, but when did it become a big black hole of yearning when I think about it? I can't pinpoint the moment, but to me it feels like it was the difference between holding a baby and finding it sweet and cute, and holding a baby and still finding it sweet and cute, but also wanting to cry because I just want one so bad!

I also think that seeing pregnancy announcements, there was an evolution between "OMG they're having a baby!" and now it's "OMG they're having a baby? But I WANT ONE TOOOOOOOO :("

What killed me is the first time DH told me about yearning for kids when looking at a young family. Oh the feels 3

Edit: I agree about having a baby vs. having a member of your family. I can't wait for every stage from baby to having adult kids when your relationship can evolve and you become less of a "parent" and more of a friend :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cursing myself for not being diligent with my OPKs...

I forgot to take on on Tuesday, and only was able to take one last night at 11 p.m... It wasn't positive, but the 2 lines were almost the same color (it's still the darkest that I've ever seen).
I guess I was not expecting much of this cycle, I ovulated at CD41 last time and am currently at CD23. My CM wasn't telling me much (I never have a lot).

Well last night when we had sex holy moly EWCM :O

And my temps? The last 4 days have gone from 96.2 (my lowest ever), 96.6, 97.1 and then 97.3 today!

I have no idea if I ovulated yesterday and missed my surge, or if I'll be ovulating today, but man I can't predict shit with my body... And since I wasn't prepared for it we didn't BD nearly as much as I would have liked. Oh well, it's still a good thing if I ovulated 20 days earlier than last cycle.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're not alone. TTC is stressful even when there is nothing wrong fertility-wise. It's great that you are taking steps to figure out what's going on and being proactive to fix what you can. I echo what u/Icussr said about doctors being amazing and going round obstacles to get you a baby. She also has a great point about voicing what you're thankful for. It helps to see those other things in darker times.

Good luck :) </TEXT>

I'm so so tired. All the time. I fell back asleep after my alarm went off this morning and then had to rush to get to work on time (barely made it). I'm feeling a bit queasy and zero motivated. Also stressed for a meeting with my Master's Director, meetings with him are never really fun and they just make me feel stupid.

When I think back on how I started taking HBC at 15 because I had acne and irregular cycles and never asked any questions, I just feel like facepalming myself, seeing as 12 years later I'm now *trying* to get pregnant and hey, surprise! My cycles are still super fucked up and irregular, and the acne's back :(

My thermometer is by my bed and it's now second nature to temp the second I wake up. Not a drag for me at all, plus I love seeing the data on my chart haha.

As for OPKs, well I've taken close to 50 by now (first cycle I only did a few, second cycle took one every day for a month because fuck my long cycles), and I never got anything close to a positive... So my relationship with OPKs is not the best. I'ma  big drinker and I hate feeling dehydrated too, so I also find a 4-hour hold to be crappy. But seeing as how I never have CM to rely on either, I trudge on with OPK use, like a good TTC soldier haha! </TEXT>

I noticed my temps were more stable after O and was wondering if that was normal as well? TCOYF has just perfect pretty charts that I can't compare myself with haha </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll just add in that I'm not convinced you've ovulated yet either, BUT, positive OPKs ar a great sign and if your cycle is fairly regular then maybe your app prediciton is right (or close to it). So... go on and have sex haha, have fun!

<TEXT> Hey u/SquidFarts , I usually manage to stay out of it too... But I feel a little bit in-between, with some TFAB posts from first-time BFPs can come off as irritating I agree, but also I've been lurking on stilltrying for a few weeks and have seen quite a few comments like the one above, which to me comes off as a bit hurtful (because I feel like I'd be judged for posting on stilltrying being only 6 months in) and intimidating. 

I totally agree that there definitely can be a lack of perspective from those only a few cycles in, but that's something I think we only realize once we're further down the road and we *do* have that perspective of having tried for a while and realizing that it's not that easy.

I just think that it's better when there's more support and less belittling. And I doubly agree that it's really hard to put into words, I always wonder if I'm getting across clearly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is it normal to have such a huge temp difference in my pre-O temps? I've been between 96.2 and 97.2, I find that one whole degree is a lot :/
[Chart!](https://www.fertilityfriend.com/home/subject1257)

I temp orally and at pretty much the same time every day. I don't normally mouth-breathe either, and the 2 discarded temps from this weekend were because of wine the night before (2 glasses is enough to mess it up for me).

PS- Is 96.2 too low? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Those who have been trying for four months shouldn't get so upset and jealous of others getting pregnant right away.

I agree they *shouldn't*, but TTC is an emotional journey right from the start, and things get intense and emotional right from the start. I don't want to start a heated debate or anything, but just because someone has been trying for a few months vs. over a year does not mean they are not allowed to have negative feelings about not getting pregnant quickly...

I just hate when things turn into a *us vs. those who get pregnant quickly* debate...

And yes, my flair says cycle 3, it's not a mistake. I've **only** been trying for 6 months, but seeing as how I've ovulated just once, I know I'll be trying for a long while yet and am trying to gear up for that and to give and get support from the ladies on here and TFAB. Just my two cents about this.. </TEXT>

I've found that temping really helps me see what's going on, and it definitely doesn't feel like a big chore. After 5 months temping (6 months TTC), it's just automatic for me. I hope you fell the same way when you start temping! Good luck :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a link between high TSH and periods that are super lights and short? I'm trying to gather all the info I can, because I suspect my thyroid is not optimal for TTC

Stopped HBC in August (had 3 days withdrawal bleed), cycle 1: 105 days, anovulatory. 2.5 day period, then cycle 2 lasted 55 days (ovulated on CD41). My last period only lasted 1.5 days and was very light.

TSH was 3.7 in November

Hands and feet always frickin cold no matter how warmly dressed I am

I sleep 11-hours on weekends, and about 7 hours#night during the week, am always tired.

I haven't really gained weight though so this makes me doubt a bit (gained 5 pounds), but my mom has Hashimoto's and has always been super skinny even when she was in hypothyroid...

Could that be my problem? </TEXT>

Thank you for your kind words... I feel like I've been fending this off for a long time already and my energy reserves have run out. I think I'm at the point where I have to plough through the shame and tell my doctor that I'm not doing so well...

But that brings on another set of problems, like why the hell am I TTC if I'm not doing ok for myself? How do I think I'll be able to care for a baby if taking care of myself right now feels like a chore? I'm afraid my doctor will judge me for wanting a baby now even through this.

<TEXT> Thanks for the support.

The best-case scenario would be to finish my degree with a break from work, but financially that would not be possible (because we have a house). Honestly I'm thinking about asking to be put on sick leave by my doctor. That would at least give me a percentage of my salary while I'm off work...

I would consider changing jobs for a part-time job, but honestly although I hate my job, I can't argue that the conditions are nothing to complain about (decent salary for the amount of work, paid vacations, etc).

I understand that quitting everything might not help, but damn that's what I feel like doing just now. I don't want to see anyone or do anything.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been at this job since May, and the main reason I hate it (and also hated my last one, which I worked for 4 years at), is that I'm currently completing a Master's degree but I'm working a freaking office agent position. I feel like my "talents" or "potential" is being wasted on trivial unimportant tasks that don't mean anything to anyone...
My colleagues are just... bittered employees who probably hate their jobs too, so I feel like everyone's just on the edge of a breakdown all the time, all I hear is complaining...
I am looking at other positions, but I don't want to change just for the sake of change, because I don't see how things will improve if I just get another entry-level job..

It just sucks and I feel like the longer I'm stuck here, the less I'll be able to do a better job, because right now I just hate everything so much I don't even feel like doing my actual job.
I've just started a reduced 4-day week, with my day off to be used to finish my Master's. So far I've succeeded in waking up at 11, then stressing out because I'm wasting my day off :/

TL, DR: I'm stuck in a rut, and know it's partly my fault. I need to snap out of it soon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been feeling really down lately, and I have the feeling that isn't going to just go away on its own if I don't do something...

There are many reasons why I'm feeling like this, TTC being part of it (I think it's just excerbated things that were already there). I hate my job and I feel like a failure, because all my life my parents' focus on me had been my good grades and all that.. Well now, at 27, I feel like I'm letting everyone down because I'm not working in nutrition, the field in which I did a Bachelor's degree... I didn't love it that much and decided to do a Master's in education in order to be able to work with special needs students... Forward 2 years later, I'm still not done and I'm just struggling to keep my head above water. I don't even know if my Master's is going to bring me anywhere and help me secure a job I actually like... All these feelings are just crappy and I feel like I'm stuck here in this bad headspace.

I went to see a therapist last May because I hated my old job, it got me thinking about stuff and I changed jobs and figured I'd be fine... Well now 8 months later I hate my new job even more and feel like I've got no strength left to continue to go to work and plaster a smile on my face. I'm not productive, I hate all my colleagues, I feel so out of place and I just wish I could stay home...
I've gone back to see the therapist in December and am going weekly now, but I don't feel like it's helping at all, I just feel like I'm getting worse week by week. I spent the new year's countdown crying in the middle of the crowd, everyone just looked so happy, and all I could think was that 2016 had been absolute crap and I wasted my year feeling numb and sorry for myself, with no hope that 2017 would be any better.

I think I have depression. But I'm not able to say it out loud, to admit it to myself or anyone else. I don't know what to do. I feel like I need a break from work if I'm ever going to get on top again.

Holy crap I'm so sorry about the long rant, I feel like I'm just a Debbie-downer in here. But somehow typing all this to strangers takes a (tiny) load off my shoulders...

How's that for a Moody Monday? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I saw my doctor in November (after 3 months, 90 days into my first cycle post-HBC). She sent me for blood tests (the basics) and an ultrasound, told me to go back and see her in 3 months (February) if things still hadn't regularized by then. I have an appointment for next week, seeing as I've had 2 extremely short periods since the withdrawal bleed when I went off HBC in August.

I'm planning on inquiring more about thyroid issues (my TSH was 3.7 in November and I feel like crap all the time), as well as other hormonal issues (been having bad acne since getting off HBC along with lack of cycles). I definitely would like more testing and feel like if there's something wrong I'd like to know sooner rather than later on... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks, it is really frustrating... I get that there's only a 20-30% chance per cycle in the best of circumstances, but pisses me off that we've only had 1 proper chance in 6 months... And doing OPKs seems helpful for many of you ladies, but I POAS for one whole month last cycle, never got a positive OPK when I finally did ovulate on CD41, so it just feels like a lot of work for nothing these days... It all just feels like I'm forever waiting, with no results at all, and I am NOT a patient person :/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I get wanting to be in a better place before doing anything else... We've been at it for 6 months and I've only ovulated once, so obviously this is gonna take a while. I'm not in a good mental space right now, and not being pregnant is probably adding on to that, but there's a part of me that's almost relieved I'm not pregnant because holy crap I need to feel better before I can possibly think of growing a human being :/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like this idea of making a list together- it's less of a contest as to who's doing what, and further testing could help figure out what's going on with her cycles. The SA is also a good idea, my fianc is supposed to call his GP for one soon, even though I'm pretty sure that due to my fucked up cycles the problem is me, at least we'll know things are ok on his end.
As for caffeine and alcohol, without 100% cutting it out, is it possible for you to reduce a bit? If your SO and you are both cutting down together it might be easier and less frustrating. 

As for the emotional shutdown, I have no useful advice except try to communicate openly and without judgement... Good luck and I hope you get answers soon (and a BFP) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Welcome!!

I highly suggest temping to confirm ovulation, that way you know that if you ovulated late (for example, on CD 25 instead of CD15) so you won't think your period is 10 days late and stres about getting BFNs and not knowing what is going on! As someone having gone off HBC in August and having had a 106-day cycle, then a 55-day cycle, if I wasn't temping I'd be going (even more) crazy.

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like unsolicited advice honestly, keep it coming!
I did talk about it to my doctor because of all my symptoms, but she said that we really weren't there yet (3 months ago, 3 months after stopping HBC). She said my body might just need more time to regulate post-HBC. I'm also not the "typical" PCOS type (BMI of 21, had no actual kysts on my ovaries, and yes I feel like I have some facial hair but I'm super blonde so it doesn't show too much), but I definitely feel like the other symptoms related to male hormones are there, so I will definitely bring it up at my next appointment with my doctor in 2 weeks. Thanks for the advice! </TEXT>

I still haven't found anything that completely fends off acne, but I wash my face with Clean and Clear foaming oil-free cleanser, and my doctor prescribed a face cream with clindomycin and benzoyl peroxyde (one of the only combinations that are safe when pregnant).

For my hair, I used to easily go 2 days, and be able to stretch for a 3rd day, and now I stretch to 2 days :( I've started using Lush's Restauration shampoo and I love it, as it takes care of my oily roots without destroying my ends too much (I've got long hair and it's blonde, so the ends break super easily).

If anyone else has a magic combo, I'd love to hear of it!! </TEXT>

I don't really remember how I was before HBC to be honest, except that I had acne, and the pill was supposed to help.

So, this past August I got off HBC -- My boobs shrank, I got really bad acne (and backne, FML), still here after 6 months, I lost a lot of hair too (my hair was almost too think so it's not a big deal for me), got hair popping up all over the place.... :/ Sorry for not offering reassurance, but the effects really vary from person to person, and apparently, my stupid body is really crappy at functioning on its own... </TEXT>

As far as the alcohol thing, you can tell your friend (wink wink) that it messes up my temps *big time* -- I'm usually between 96.6 and 97 before O, and if I have more than 1 drink it goes up to like 97.7, 97.9 :( I just discard those temps... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I stopped HBC in August 2016 and went to see my doctor in November when I still hadn't gotten my period (ecept the withdrawal bleeding in August). She ran blood tests, hence how I know my TSH was 3.7 in November, and an ultrasound (I had a 3-cm kyst on my left ovary). She then sent me for a follow-up ultrasound in January (all clear, no more kysts), and told me to go back and see her for more testing in February (I have an appointment on the 23rd) if things don't regulate by then... So here I am, on CD19 of my 3rd cycle in 6 months. I was planning on asking about thyroid function as well as other hormonal problems... I never thought that I'd be here after 6 months :( I can't even plan BD around my fertile period, as so far I've had only one! I'm also temping and doing OPKs to have the most data I can get.

<TEXT> Aww, Moondog... That's a lot to take in. I read the whole thing (woo hoo!) and your rambling is totally normal and was indeed informative. I'm glad you took charge of things to get answers instead of waiting around, it always feels better to know we're doing *something* at least...

I totally get that you don't want to give up now, and that's perfectly fine, you've still got some options!

It was also informative for me to see that they've given you meds for your 3.7 TSH, mine was also 3.7 in November and I've had long, fucked-up and anovulatory cycles, so will definitely talk with my doctor about possible hypothyroidism.

I just wish you the best of luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I get that... Did you explain to him that taking his vitamins and doing his part for the SA are things he *can* do to get more involved? And also remind him that without his swimmers there will never be a baby, so while you may be doing most of the temping and peeing on sticks and all, it takes 2 to have a baby!

And just the fact that you're aware you might be a little bit too self-sufficient might help you include him a bit more in the process if he wants to be? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh man this sounds almost exactly like my situation...
My best friend and I both stopped HBC at the same time in August, thinking we might get pregnant around the same time... She got pregnant 2 weeks later (is now 27 weeks), and I've ovulated only once in that whole time, no BFP remotely in sight. I love her and she's my best friend, but she will never understand what I'm going through with TTC, not knowing what your body's doing, and being scared that you'll never be able to have a baby. I am really happy for her, but at the same time it hurts so bad every time I see her and her beautiful belly. It's not getting easier with time, her due date is coming up and there she'll be, with her perfect little baby, while my uterus will still be woefully empty... It sucks, but it's life. On top of it, I'll probably have to *organize* her shower, and I have no idea how I'm going to deal with that...

The one thing that's helped me a little bit is reminding myself that babies are not finite resources; just because someone else is getting one does not reduce your chances of having one too, it isn't pie! ;)

<TEXT> I'm not sure about the exact mg of the dosage, but I take the Mucinex pill (regular kind with only guafaisine (sp?)) just one a day in mid-afternoon (the package says the effects last 12 hours). I start taking it around CD12-14, but last cycle took it for a month, as I ovulated only on CD41. Hopefully this cycle I won't need to do it as long. I stop taking it once I know I've ovulated. And drinking water helps, otherwise there's nothing to liquefy! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Awww, even though I'd feel the same way about not getting ahead of myself, I think it's sweet that he's on board and optimistic about this! 
FYI my first cycle off hBC lasted 106 days with no ovulation to be seen. My second cycle lasted 55 days with confirmed O at CD41, and I'm now on CD14 of cycle 3 after 6 months off HBC. So don't give up hope, but it's good to be realistic and realize that with your long cycles you may need to arm yourselves with some patience. I hope you're getting answers on your PCOS and that things work out in the next cycle, fingers crossed! </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all, welcome! I don't have any "official" medical conditions which would make TTC a risk for me right now, but the past few months have brought up a lot of emotions for me, I'v been having a hard time (TTC-related stress may have exacerbated this but most of it is me being so unsure of myself and self-esteem issues and realizing I'm 27 and ain't got shit figured out and bla bla bla) and I think I may be in a depression and actually think that's it's been on and off for me for a *long* time. 

Anyhow, I get the TTC guilt when I think of how crappy I'm feeling right now and "why the hell do I think I can bring a baby into this world and take care of it right now" and "what if I stay this unhappy forever and end up being a crappy mother" and "you're crazy if you think having a baby will make you happier".

Sorry about my too-long ramble, but is there any way you could broach the subject with your doctor, to see if there are any major issues that would really warrant not having a baby vs. what you *think* your doctor may think of you? Sorry if I'm not being clear. What I mean to say is that if you really want this, then go for it! What you're doing right now by trying to get healthier is great. Ask questions to your doctor, advocate for yourself...

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> To add on Mucinex, while it doesn't actually help  the sperm swim better, the fact that it makes your CM more liquid (when taken properly, with enough water etc.) can help them get closer to where they need to be.

No wedding plans yet, we're both low-key and honestly, for now being engaged is just fine for me.

I also think that trying to regulate your body with lifestyle and diet changes is a good thing. I mean it can't hurt to get a bit healthier right, even if it doesn't fix all your problems? </TEXT>

Thankful for DH who loves my like I am, even on my bad days, even when I'm being a nut.
Thankful for TFAB and the girls on here who answer questions, support, and commiserate (with a side of snark ahaha).
Thankful I now have a 4-day week, even if my day off is to work on my Master's- staying home in my PJs beats driving to the office 100%.
Today I am also thankful that my 4-year-old Great Dane is happy and healthy, currently sleeping on my couch. I found out this morning that one of her "younger brothers" (same 2 parents but younger litter) has died of cancer during the night... He wasn't even 3 years old and got diagnosed only 2 weeks ago :( I can't imagine the pain of losing my baby at such a young age...
Lastly, thankful to be (mostly) healthy and able to go for a run when I want to. </TEXT>

After 6 months and nothing worth shit to show for it except my sanity which is being tested more than usual, I'm trying not to think about possibly being pregnant or not for future events. Signed up for 3 races, including my 2nd half-marathon at the end of August, and will also plan a trip with DH (although we will try to go somewhere Zika-free, there's a difference between living and just plain taking unnecessary risks). I might also go for getting a new pair of pants, something I'd been holding off on since August (but what if they only fit me for a few months? -_- ). It's a daily struggle though, I keep thinking "well if I get pregnant this cycle I'll have a November baby"... Ugh </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm almost exactly in the same situation as you, my TSH level in November was 3.7, so in the "normal" range, but when I got to reading about Subclinical Hypothyroidism and how TSH higher than 2-2.5 could be bad for conceiving I was planning on bringing it up with my doctor, but also need more credible sources than, "some strangers on the interwebs told me so" ;) I think I read something to that effect on the Thyroid Foundation Canada [website.](http://www.thyroid.ca/pregnancy_fertility.php)

Also on [here!] (http://hypothyroidmom.com/infertility-miscarriage-and-subclinical-hypothyroidism/)

ETA: More details: my mom has Hashimoto's and my maternal Grandma had nodules removed from her thyroid, so I am wary of my thyroid from the start. Also, I'm always tired, often cold, feeling under the weather for close to a year now and have only had 2 very short periods in 6 months since stopping HBC (also pretty sure I only ovulated once in 6 months). I think all that gives me ammunition to ask my doctor to pursue the TSH investigation a bit further. Hope this can help you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> No I haven't actually tried seeing a midwife. I think I'll reserach that a bit. My family doctor actually wasn't *that* dismissive when I went to see her after 3 months off HBC and no period. She ordered basic bloodwork and an ultrasound and told me to go back and see her 3 months later (February) if things were still not moving. I consider that 2 very short periods in 6 months is something to be looked at and will try to see her again quite soon, but I'm stressed because I don't know exactly what to ask her other than "Please tell me what the fuck is wrong with my body, NOW!" Lol, I feel a bit crazy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just because other people may have bigger issues does not diminish yours, just wanted to remind you of that. I've been feeling extra-stressed about this TTC and extra-scared that I won't be able to get pregnant naturally since the beginning, as I never had regular periods at all (before HBC and since coming off of it). I felt silly for being such an emotional roller-coaster during my first cycle (which lasted 106 days!), and tried to be more mellow during cycle 2 (55 days).. But now I'm on cycle 3 in 6 months and that feeling is still there. DH wants a baby and of course is a bit impatient, but he is not the one temping and peeing on sticks and getting ultrasounds and analysis every shred of symptoms, so he can't 100% understand. At least we have TFAB and all the ladies and info on here ;) </TEXT>

<TEXT> CD8 here. Nothing new on my end (as usual lol). I just feel like nothing is happening and time passes so slow, probably because we've only had 1 chance to conceive so far in close to 6 months TTC, but at the same time time just flies by, as we are already 6 months in with nothing to show for it. I'm getting a bit impatient and would like some answers or some sign of my body functioning normally... </TEXT>

<TEXT> .... and I'm back to waiting to ovulate. Took 41 days last time, so I have no idea how long this is going to take. Hopefully I'll have enough OPKs haha (bought a big box with 50 strips just about when I O'ed last cycle), not that it helped me last time, as I never managed to get a positive OPK at all.
Also still waiting for news from my doctor, but I don't even think we'll be doing anything for now because it's been *only* 6 months (which feels like fucking forever) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm back! Took an almost weekly break from TFAB due to a combination of many things- busy at work (for once), started CD1 last Wednesday, and trying to advance on my Master's during my days off so when I was working on my laptop I actually turned off my Wi-Fi to eliminate the temptation to procrastinate :)
So I'm currently on CD7, but with my super long and irregular cycles I haven't yet started thinking about when my fertile period will possibly arrive... Last cycle I ovulated at CD41 so... I got a huge box of Easy@Home OPKs and will start testing next week just to make sure I don't miss it, although I never got a positive OPK last cycle.
That's it for my pointless ramble of the day! </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a mix of both actually, wonder/anger simultaneously at how little we are taught about our own bodies, and about how doctors don't talk about the many effects HBC can have on your body for a long time even when you stop it... I went off HBC in August 2016 and so far have had only 2 cycles (106 days, 56 days) in almost 6 months... I'm mostly pissed. Haven't even finished TCOYF yet, it's so much information to process all at once and has got me freaking out about all the things that could be wrong with me to explain my fucked up cycles... I will definitely finish it and probably re-read it though (I also read "The Impatient Woman's Guide to Getting Pregnant" twice, which has some of the same info in less detail) </TEXT>

On another note, stupid question: if my temp dropped yesterday (but was still above coverline) and my period started last night at 10 p.m., is CD1 yesterday even though I spent all day without AF, or should I start counting today as CD1 (my temp continued dropping today, is now just under coverline)?

<TEXT> I transferred all my data from Glow to FF last week. My first cycle started on August 17 and finished on December 1st (106 days, pretty sure I didn't ovulate). I entered my data for the whole cycle, but FF only shows me the 48 first days of this cycle on my chart, which really sucks because my temping got better near the end of that cycle, and I wanted to see what the chart looked like, especially since I did have a few higher temps near the end of the cycle.
Is there a way to have the whole cycle show up on my chart, or there's nothing to do with a wacky 106-day cycle?
Thanks in advance ladies! </TEXT>

We've been trying since August, temping since September but my first cycle was anovulatory and lasted 106 days, so this is the first time I have proof of ovulation with a temp shift. I even have an apparent triphasic shift!
I'm currently 13DPO and got BFNs yesterday and on 11DPO, almost no symptoms except a few moments of twinges of pain/weird sensation in my lower pelvic area, and a few minutes of nausea/dizziness... What gives? Do you girls have any advice for me please?? I'm getting desperate :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, I hate Mondays..
Spent the weekend with a 36-week pregnant friend who was freaking out about the impeding arrival of her baby...
Currently 13DPO and super disappointed.. Tested at 11 and 12DPO and got BFNs. I'm a bit pissed, my chart was super pretty, I even had a triphasic shift and all. Now I'm just waiting for stupid AF, come on already :( Hopegully my next cycle will be even shorter, I went from 106 days to 54 for this cycle, would be nice to have a "normal" length next time (hopefully with ovulation too).

<TEXT> Also 10DPO today, no symptoms, no CM, my temp is up and FF has detected a triphasic pattern... I don't even know how long my LP is going to be, since this is the first time I've ovulated since stoping HBC 6 months ago. (Over)analysis any and all data is what we TTCers do! It may be boring to get such stable temperatures, but at least your pattern must be crystal-clear! </TEXT>

10DPO right now, zero symptoms so far :( Somehow I feel like I should have symptoms at this point.. Got a BFN yesterday because I'm a tool and couldn't resist taking a test (not even with FMU, what was I thinking?) </TEXT>

<TEXT> 9DPO today (CD50), still nothing to report. Convinced that I'm not pregnant just because I still can't quite believe my body is back to functioning normally, so I'm almost impatient for AF to arrive so that I can just... Move on to the next cycle. Will be calling my doctor soon, because 106 days and 50+days is definitely not a cycle length I approve of, and at this rate, we get one chance to conceive every 5 months which sucks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Welcome!!

I know trying to start off casual sounds nice, but my cycles were so effed up after BC I'm glad I at least started temping right away, because I could actually *see* that my body wasn't getting back on track. If that's something you're open to, I recommend it, just so that you have more data as well a few months from now if things are not working. I hope for your sake that you're not here for too long!
Also, everyone here recommends Fertility Friend as an app, and I've just switched to it and second all the recommendations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, been temping since mid-August! I've had trouble with my cycles, first one was anovulatory (no temp spike) and lasted 106 days. For this cycle, I did OPKs almost every day between CD12 and CD42, got a few very pale lines but nothing that looked close to positive. Got my temp spike though, FF says I probably ovulated on CD41 (I got EWCM for 2 days, also a first!). Now I'm just hoping my temps stay high long enough for a nice, normal LP... </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just posted in TFAB and was redirected here! Been participating in TFAB for a month but never got the chance to post here because there was nothing to stalk, haha.

A little backstory for everyone: Stopped HBC in August after 11 years, never had regular cycles but was in for a rude awakening. 1st cycle lasted 106 days (most probably anovulatory). Half of me was gearing up for a long, crappy cycle 2, half of me was still hopeful for something to happen.

Went to see my doctor in November, had bloodwork done and an ultrasound which revealed normal blood results (however progesterone was not tested and TSH was 3.69, so I'm keeping that in mind in case things keep being wacky) and a 3-cm kyst on my left ovary. Follow-up ultrasound last week revealed everything was normal. I finally migrated my cycle 2 data onto FF (was using Glow since August) because I finally ovulated on CD41! Currently 7DPO and I have a question:

I'm just glad I ovulated at all, but I'm also hoping things might have worked. However, I've had NO symptoms at all, but then again I never really have PMS symptoms or ovulation symptoms, so should I expect the same here? What else can I do except wait? Thanks in advance :)

Here's my chart (first time sharing it, let me know if it doesn't work): https://www.fertilityfriend.com/home/subject1257

EDITED TO ADD: I have never gotten a positive OPK and had been taking one almost every day as of CD12 this cycle, but they're not all entered on FF because I was on Glow and they were all negative anyway... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just had my first-ever temp rise so I'm pretty sure I ovulated for the first time ever... on CD40! Since we weren't expecting me to ovulate we didn't have sex quite nearly as much as I would have liked, especially since DH went out of town for 3 days during that week (I think I O'ed either the day he left or the day before). This puts me at 7DPO. No symptoms at all. I'm starting to doubt my body, like I can't believe I even ovulated. I know so many of us have symptoms suuuuper early, but is having *no* symptoms at all a bad thing? What can I expect? I don't want to get my hopes up so I keep telling myself that of course it probably didn't work, but at least I ovulated. *haalp pls* </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was also on Yasmin as of age 15 due to acne and irregular/absent periods (thanks for giving me BC instead of checking why I was so irregular). I never thoguht much of it, but since coming off HBC in August I had a 106-day anovulatory cycle, am currently on CD47 (but 6 DPO, yay!). Since coming off BC, I've had hella lots of acne (and even backne FML), greasier hair, and I find I have a bit more facial hair (luckily I'm blonde), however not overweight, no problems with insulin or glucose and no kysts on my ovaries.... Not too sure what my problem is but definitely BC just masked some of my issues for 11 years! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't give up and keep charting!! Sounds like me, I had a 106-day anovulatory cycle after stopping HBC in August, and cycle 2 was looking like a bust since I hadn't gotten any positive OPKs, no EWCM and no temp rise. Well lo and behold, I never got a positive OPK but I seem to have ovulated at CD43 or CD44 because my temps have risen and stayed high for 5 days now!! I temp orally and did have a few wonky readings but it seems better now. You might want to temp vaginally as I hear it's supposed to give more consistent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> TTC has definitely been good for our intimacy and for forcning us to take the time for each other. I've really irregular/long/anovulatory cycles so far (but I think I just O'ed for the 1st time 3 days ago, yay!), so our gameplan was to just try and have sex every 2 days (3 at the most) since we never knew when the *right time* could happen... There have been only 1 or 2 times where it felt truly forced, and that sucks, but overall this is the (almost only) positive aspect about this stressful TTC journey! </TEXT>

I've never been diagnosed with depression, but I've always felt that despite having everything I needed all throughout my life, I was never happy enough, and I did have periods where I felt that it might be easier if I weren't *there*. I'm at a low point now where I'm actually wondering if I should be trying to get pregnant at all, because how will I possibly get better and get through this if I'm not good *before* getting pregnant? I'm scared and am not sure how to bring it up with anyone... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh man, my plan was to not tell anyone when we started in order to avoid everyone asking for updates... I have the worst poker face and cannot lie to save my life, and I'm really close to my family so of course I told everyone. I also told my close friends because my best friend and I started trying at the same time, so I was happy as I thought I'd have someone sharing the same experience as me... Well, she's now 21 weeks pregnant and I haven't even ovulated once yet (actually waiting for my first temp spike, but who knows!). As for my family, I've shared my irregular cycle problems just because that's the open book I am, but they know me well enough not to ask too many questions... So I'd say that it really depends on your family dynamic, how close to them you are, etc... I'm a bit ambivalent with how I feel about everyone knowing. On one hand it's nice to know that people know what you're going through and they care about you so they'll be there, but then again I feel like no one understands and older ladies (mother, aunts, etc) seem to downplay the whole thing, like I'm dramatizing for nothing..

<TEXT> I wish you the best, TTC sex can be really good or really bad, depending on the circumstances... Either way, it isn't solely up to you to be sexier for sure, both of you have to make time and make BDing a priority during your fertile window. As you mentioned, maybe giving him less fertility details would help, whereas some guys prefer knowing. I think the key here is open and honest conversation about all of this.
Good luck, I hope things work out! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The one thing I know is that I do NOT want to go back to HBC. For now my cycles are so fucked up that I'm not sure I could effectively use FAM, but then again I'm not ovulating so no risk of a pregnancy, right? All kidding aside, DH and I discussed that after having baby #1, we'll probably use FAM for a bit until we're ready for #2 and so on, and once the family is complete, then he does his side of the contract and gets a vasectomy. And if FAM fails and we get pregnant by accident, then hell that's how it'll be, but considering how long and wacky my cycles are right now I think it's unlikely. </TEXT>

Yesterday I had quite a lot of CM (maybe something close to eggwhite, not too sure as it was the first time I had anything remotely resembling it), my cervix felt higher, softer and maybe a bit more open, but the OPK I took only had a pale 2nd line... We BD'd anyway, but I don't know if this is just another fake surge of my body *trying* to ovulate or if this will really happen, but I desperately hope that my body is getting back on track after 5 months off HBC..

<TEXT> It can get tiring, that's true! DH and I had been slacking off in the BD department for a while when we started TTC (we could go almost 2 weeks without sometimes, due to my low libido and frequent pain during the act). Stopping HBC really helped me though, less pain, mor libido, and an actual goal that we want to reach through BD. We now go every 2 or 3 days, and it has happened a few times where we didn't really feel into it when we started, but it usually finishes well (ha!). However, I feel like it has revived our sex life overall. And if we're too tired to do it one night, we just make sure to do it the next day. Don't put too much pressure on yourself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are me 3-4 months ago. Starting this journey I was like, "Hey, I'm healthy, 27, got my shit (mostly) together, so we should get pregnant within a few months". HA! Fast forward to 5 months later, and I absolutely don't get how most women go about their lives not knowing all there is to know about our reproductive system, like, I feel cheated by the system, as if somehow someone should have warned us! I'm temping, taking OPKs and trying to monitor CM, but haven't even ovulated once... It's hard on the morale of course, and there are good days and horrible days, but right now I'm getting to the point where I'm steeling myself for a long and hard time to get pregnant, and I think that adjusting your expectations is key to staying sane through this. 
I also started seeing a therapist (not just because of TTC, but many issues that I've had for a long while just become *more* amplified with the stress of TTC), so my hope is that by the time I DO get pregnant, I'll be better on my way to managing my anxiety and I'll have climbed out of the steep slope towards depression I'm currently on... Sorry for the long post, but TL;DR: Welcome to the club, hope you don't stay on TFAB for too long! </TEXT>

Now, my second cycle is on CD 39, still no O, no AF. So yes, of course it can take some time to regulate, and your LP of 12 days is not too concerning either.

<TEXT> Hey! I have a lot of the symptoms you're describing and low progesterone is definitely a possibility that I'll float by my doctor when I see her in a few weeks. My advice is for you to talk to your doctor about your concerns and ask for bloodwork (not only progesterone, but also other reproductive hormones as well as TSH to check for thyroid function, since hypothyroidism can give some similar symptoms). I'm also reading through *Taking Charge of Your Fertility* which has lots of great info about all these symptoms. Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've got long/irregular/probably anovulatory cycles and I might be crazy, but I am using OPKs *just in case*...
I stopped the pill in August and so had no idea if/when I'd ovulate, I used a few OPKs in September (with only negative results). Turns out my first cycle lasted 106 days with no visible ovulation (was also temping). On to cycle 2 with some optimism (ha!), started taking OPKs almost every day between CD 12 and now (CD 36) without any positives, only a few days with a very faint second line.
I'm starting to be pretty bummed out and frustrated with my body, but I also order a big box of cheap Amazon OPKs to keep on *trying* to see something happening, although my hopes are crumbling to dust right about now...
Will be seeing my doctor very soon if this keeps up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well hello then :)
I found out about the cyst in November during an ultrasound that my doctor had prescribed after I went to see her after stopping BC for 2.5 months without a period. She then sent me for some basic bloodwork and an ultrasound to see if there was anything blatantly wrong with me (there wasn't outright, but I have some more questions as things don't seem to be getting any better). I'm anxious to see what the follow-up ultrasound will show, but I'll see my doctor again because I have a shitload of questions haha! </TEXT>

Seeing my doctor in a few weeks and will definitely try to push for more tests, especially as prolactin was not tested in November. Thanks for the info :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not taking Vitex or any special supplements. I take a multivitamin + folic acid + omega-3.
Originally, I stopped the pill mid-August, and went to see my doctor in November because nothing had happened (no ovulation, no period except BC withdrawal mid-august). She had me do bloodowrk and an ultrasound to see if there was anything blatantly wrong with my uterus/ovaries etc. Things came back mostly normal (my TSH level is at 3.89 which is considered normal but maybe a bit too high to conceive, and I had a 3-cm kyst on my ovary, which will be re-checked next week with a follow-up ultrasound) She told me to go back and see her in 3 months (February) if things were still at a standstill. So that's what I'l do. I didn't take Vitex just because I want to see how my body does without it, and I think my doctor would probably tell me to not take it anyway for now </TEXT>

As for the calories in lattes, I'm not *really* looking to lose weight (I'm a perfectly healthy weight but if I could drop 5 lbs without doing anything drastic I wouldn't say no) so I wouldn't cut back just for those few calories, plus, right now I put cream so it'll probably come out almost the same :) But that's a good point for someone really wishing to lose weight! </TEXT>

I am definitely seeing my doctor in a few weeks since this is not normal. I had some bloodwork done in the fall and an ultrasound in November, going back in a week for a follow-up ultrasound (I had a 3-cm cyst on an ovary), but I know I don't want to wait a full year before taking the next steps. I encourage you to do the same if you can, it feels just a bit better knowing we're doing what we can to get the ball rolling. Best of luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm feeling a bit down today, but also... neutral, like I've run out of emotions. It's my first day back at work after the holidays, the office is empty, there was a snowstorm during the night so it took me an hour to drive to work in the snow and I'm tired, because who wakes up at 6 a.m. on Christmas vacation? On the TTC front, I'm getting a bit discouraged and I'm trying to distance myself from obssessing but it's impossible... I'm on CD34 of my second cycle and have had no hint of ovulation (am temping and took about 15 OPKs since CD 14, first cycle lasted 106 days and was most likely anovulatory). I'm getting impatient. And mad. After 5 months I haven't even gotten one single chance to conceive, but in the meantime we're trying to get busy every 2 or 3 days, "just in case"... It's starting to take a toll. The only upside is that I've signed up for 3 races for 2017, so at least if I'm not pregnant I'll have at least something to look forward to... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yay for runners!!
I ran my first half-marathon at the end of August when we started TTC, with the naive "plan" that I'd be having a baby in the summer/fall of 2017, so I'd be off from running and return with a vengeance in 2018.. Well, that plan didn't work out so far, but in the meantime I slacked off running all fall, so here I am, starting 2017, out of shape with a body and hormones that seem to just hate me and an empty uterus.. So I've signed up for 3 races for 2017 so far (5K in May, 10K in June, and 21K in August). Here's to hoping that I'll either get pregnant just because I'm making so many plans for summer, or kick some butt in my races! </TEXT>

Honestly, had I known I would have stopped it much earlier, but all you hear is, "You can get pregnant like, the second you stop birth control", it's been drilled into our heads for so long that I just took it at face value. Now, when actually trying to get pregnant, I marvel at how some people can accidentally get pregnant whilst some that try for years (without any major infertility problems) just can't... </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Impatient Woman's Guide is a gem! It reads like a friend is talking to you, and she really makes all the science understandable!

As for me, I started temping right away just to get into the habit and to see how my body would act after 11 years on the pill. I don't regret starting that right away, as my cycles are proving to be reallly messed up (cycle 1: 106 days, currently on CD22 of cycle 2 and have not ovulated yet). I took a few OPKs last cycle when I thought I might be ovulating, and am doing so right now as well, but that's juste me, I'm impatient and I hate not knowing what's going on in my body, and I want to be pregnant like, last August, so.... There you have it! Good luck :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> From what I know (bachelor's degree in nutrition) it's fine if you don't have any other medical conditions that could affect how your body absorbs nutrients. That is what I'm doing: regular multivitamin + folic acid + omega-3 (I don't eat enough fish and the mutlivitamin does not have omega-3 in it). I've never had a problem with iron and eat quite well so do not feel the need for iron supplement for now. I think you're fine if you keep doing what you're doing right now :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for your kind words. I did ask my doctor and saw her after 80-85 days of my 106-day cycle, she sent me for blood tests and an ultrasound, which were mostly normal (TSH was 3.89 which I find borderline too high, and I had a 3-cm kyst on my ovary which will be checked again on Jan. 12). I did mention PCOS because I noticed some symptoms (acne, no period, greasy hair, tiredness/depression, facial hair), but I am really not the "typical" PCOS profile so we'll keep an eye on that but she didn't seem to convinced for now. I'm just hoping this bad joke is going to end soon without a PCOS diagnosis. Fingers crossed! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow, thanks for this! I was looking at posts about OPKs as I need help... I don't know when I'm supposed to ovulate (irregular cycles since getting off the pill after 11 years), so I've been doing OPKs for over a week now (OPK on CD12, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20). They were all negative, but I had a very pale line on CD 19 and then a squinter (really really faint) on CD20. WTF is up with that? DH is away for work since CD19 and is back tomorrow (CD22), I'm just terrified that I'll ovulate for the 1st time in 5 months while he's gone.
Also temping and have not had a clear rise, I had a 97.5 temp on CD17 but had had a few drinks the night before. All my other temps are regular, between 96.5 and 97. Please developmentalbiology use your science powers on me! I love science (but definitely not understanding what the hell is going on right now) *thanks!* </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm newish as well (trying for 5 months, but on TFAB for 3 weeks), and it is a bit intimidating... I generally like to be informed on whatever I'm doing, but of course I'm no expert when I just start out at something. I may have asked questions that I could have found the answer to on yahoo answers, but honestly? I'd much rather have you guys' opinions than someone on yahoo answers. I don't feel like those of you who have been on here for long necessarily do it on purpose, but I think that generally, snark levels increase with the number of months TTC and that's just normal.
However, if I take into account my anxiety about every little thing in life, and seeing how having a baby is a major fucking deal, I don't see how I could possible be more zen, even if I haven't been trying for over 6 or 12 months. I just think the support is great, but the hive mentality can sometimes get the best of everyone and blow something out of proportion.
I kinda wish I had kept lurking for longer, but my desire to butt in was stronger...

I wish she'd just give me SOMETHING to kickstart the process. I hope you can get your doctor to give you progesterone to move things along, and I hope 2017 brings a BFP! </TEXT>

It always feels weird at first (to me), we've been told so many times not to get pregnant by accident, but by now I just marvel at the fact that some people do get pregnant by accident, knowing how ALL the little details have to be JUST right for it to happen and to actually stick! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was looking for Moody Monday because I needed to rant, so I posted in the general chat instead. Monday sucks, especially since DH is leaving for work today and will be gone 4 days, during which Glow predicts I will ovulate. I'm hoping Glow is waaaay off so that I only ovulate once he's back but hey, with my luck the first time I ovulate in 5 months will probably be when I'm home alone. Grrr, I just hate everything today, stupid body, troll brain, crappy uterus and non-cooperating ovaries! kbye  </TEXT>

Last cycle my temps did go up a bit, a week before AF arrived. If that was my body ovulating, then my luteal phase was at most 7 days, which is bad as well. I guess we'll see! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Monday rant--  Everything sucks.. Been trying for 5 months and are only starting our 2nd actual cycle because of my fucked up body trying to recover from BC since August Well Glow estimates that I should ovulate this week (but my negative interior voice doesnt believe it, because last time Glow was off, predicted a 37-day cycle when it lasted 106 days). Anyhow, DH has to leave for work, from today until Thursday, missing 4 of the 6 most fertile days if Glow was accurate. We had decided to at least have sex this morning before I left for work (at 6 a.m) Well, first time this happens, but DH was not able to finish at all. I feel like a failure, a bad girlfriend who puts too much pressure on the guy, bla bla bla So now Im almost wishing that I dont ovulate until he comes back so that we might have just a little chance! To add to it, Ive never been able to see a positive LH surge on OPKs, so I dont even know for sure that my body is able to ovulate.
Just feeling overall shitty today and dont know who to tell except you guys At this rate Ill never see a BFP, and I hope that the situation with DH was a one-time thing, the worst that could happen is that he cant get it up for fear of not being able to perform, BECAUSE of me.. End rant.

However, I have seen quite a few BFPs with long cycles.. Doesn't matter when you ovulate, as long as you do.
I also recommend asking your doc for blood tests as soon as you can, it's always better to start checking things out before the 6 or 12-month mark, I personally asked for bloodwork during my first cycle (which lasted 106 days btw), and was told to go back and see her in 2 months if things are still unbalanced and all...

<TEXT> But how do you know when your symptoms are "bad" enough to count as PCOS? I never had regular periods before starting BC at 16. I've been off BC for 5 months, had a 106-day cycle, just starting out my 2nd cycle so I don't know how long that one will last, I don't know if I ovulated, and at an ultrasound I passed around CD 90 last cycle they found a 3-cm cyst on my ovary. I'm not overweight, my blood tests came out normal but I don't think they tested for androgens. 
I also have a lot of acne since stopping the pill, and I find I have a few more hairs on my upper lip and chin (but were they there before and I hadn't noticed or did they just grow recently, I'm not sure). So basically I have sooo many questions and so few answers :/ Going back for a follow-up ultrasound in January, hopefully I will get more answers after that </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just like so many of you, my Facebook has been rolling with the wedding announcements, pregnancy announcements and baby pictures. So far so good, or at least somewhat tolerable. However, my childhood friend just announced her pregnancy to me in a message. She's back in university, just bought a house and I didn't even know she and her boyfriend were trying. I really am super happy for her, but boy am I glad she told me via message and that I saw it while I was alone at home... I started bawling of course, AND another acquaintance has just announced as well.
I just had to get this off my chest, can't do that with anyone in my  real life without sounding like a whiny jealous ungrateful bitch, so here it is.

<TEXT> I've never had an abortion, but before taking BC at 16 I never had regular cycles at all, and I was always left with a little nagging voice in my head saying "what if you can't have babies?" This is 99% irrational and unfounded, but it's still in the back of my mind. We started TTC in mid-August and my first cycle lasted 106 days. I thought I would die from the anxiety, the stress... which might have made my cycle even more wonky! The point being, I decided to try and speak louder than the negative voice in my head, while still taking charge of what I could (temping, CM monitoring, OPKs). Best of luck to you, and try to drown out the negative. </TEXT>

I stopped BC back in August, thinking that things would regulate quite quickly and almost expecting to get pregnant either in September, October, or November. Well, my first cycle lasted 106 days, currently just starting my 2nd cycle 5 months in, trying to be patient and staying zen. My advice, start temping and monitoring CM (even if you don't obsess over it, loosely starting to get to know your body really helps), have fun and good luck!

<TEXT> I went to my family doctor after I stopped BC and had no period for 3 months, and she sent me for blood tests and an echo, which returned normal (except a 3 cm kyst on an ovary). She told me if 3 months later I still had irregular periods and was not pregnant to go back and see her, and has prescribed another echo follow-up 8 weeks after the first one. AF finally arrived at 106 days, starting my 2nd official cycle right now. I'm temping, trying to monitor CM and will also try OPKs (although I have no clue when/if I ovulate).
Anyhow, my point is that I did not want to wait 12 months before starting to figure out if we'll need extra help to get pregnant, and my doctor was perfectly fine with that, I was afraid she would tell me I was paranoid and exaggerating, but she was fine. I say to start planning for your next steps if you think you'll need extra assistance to conceive, always better to plan in advance than to scramble last-minute to try and get appointments!
Good luck! </TEXT>

We started trying mid-August, and I was overly positive as well. We went on a 2-week trip to Portugal, no stress, lots of sex, but no BFP. I came back from Portugal to my best friend announcing her pregnancy on her first cycle. I thought we'd be in this together, living through it at the same time... Turns out my cycle lasted 106 days this time around, I'm just starting my cycle #2, 4.5 months in! No Christmas announcement for me either :( But honestly it's up and down, I just have to balance myself between being too optimistic and easily let down and thinking it'll never happen for me. I'm not losing hope, we'll have another shot soon (I hope). I just hope for my sanity that I get pregnant before she has her baby in May.

As for activities to distract myself? Well heck I indulged a little bit with alcohol during my period, and binge-watching Netflix shows makes you think of something else! </TEXT>

<TEXT> At least you can calculate what a regular cycle is for you.. I've had 37 days, then 106... My OPK budget is going to be sky-high if I start testing at CD9 and end up with a 100-day cycle! That's my Monday complainin' :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I vaguely heard of trying Mucinex, but I'm not convinced haha, though it can't hurt! Can you give more details on how it works/how much you have to take, etc?
Hope it worked for you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not crazy at all!
I've been with my boyfriend for 6 years, in our house and more financially stable for 3 years. We both went back to school 2 years ago, and that was the only thing that made me wait until this summer to officially start trying, BUT my brain has been wanting a baby for at least 2 years, so I get you! For everyone, we just started trying, but mentally I feel like I've been waiting for 2 years already </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was on Yasmin... And I didn't realize how much it affected my whole body. I'm a bit bummed I didn't stop it earlier tbh...

And as for my cycles, they were pretty irregular right up until I started the pill, if I remember correctly they were between 35-70 days... Not much help when you're trying for a baby! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Uh, I feel you. I just joined the group, and was in the same situation. Stopped bc on August 14, got a period on Aug. 17, then nothing until December 1st (106 days)... It's really frustrating not knowing if you're even ovulating at all, and wondering how long the next cycle will be... I saw my doctor after 2.5 months and she didn't seem worried, but I'm not the most patient person, so good luck to you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> 27, Quebec, Canada. Here's my situation, I'm happy to have found a place to hopefully share with people going through the same things as me :)
My bf and I have been trying since mid-august, when I stopped my birth control. Had been on bc for 11 years (started at 16 years old, never had a regular cycle before that), and somehow was overly optimistic about my body's ability to bounce back... My first cycle lasted 106 days :( Not even sure I ovulated at all...
Downloaded the Glow app on my phone, been charting my BBT and took a few OPKs (but how am I supposed to guess at my ovulation date with a 106-day cycle?).
I saw my doctor after 2.5 months, went for blood tests and an echo to see if everything was ok. Nothing blatantly wrong with me at first glance. I have a 3 cm kyst on an ovary which apparently is nothing to worry about (I'm worried though, will try to get it re-checked in a few weeks). I'm not sure I like the emotional roller-coaster, and I know we haven't been trying for long yet, but I can't help being discouraged if we're only going to have 1 shot every 4 months!
And the cherry on top? My best friend, who started trying at the same time as me, got pregnant within 15 days of stopping the pill... Any and all encouragement will be gladly accepted. Thanks! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm new to the group as well, and I think I'll like it here! Especially when I feel like I can't talk to anyone irl, no one understands how stressful it is when you're trying... I'm punching the next person who tells me to "just relax and stop thinking about it" </TEXT>
