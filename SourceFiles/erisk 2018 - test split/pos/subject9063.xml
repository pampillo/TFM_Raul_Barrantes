<TEXT> So my old hard drive corrupted and I'm trying to replace it myself. I took the old one into Canada Computers and the guy there recommended a hard drive and said it would work as a replacement for mine. I got home and put it in and tried to boot using a windows 10 configured usb. Once I get past the HP logo  get the error "Your PC encountered a problem and must resstart: System PTE Misuse" and then it's stuck in a boot loop. Maybe I didn't install the drive correctly but I'm pretty sure I did. Any ideas? Maybe this hard drive isn't actually compatable </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A month ago my hard drive broke and my laptop doesn't recognize it. I'm trying to save money by replacing it myself. I've opened up my laptop and unplugged the old hard drive. If I buy the same hard drive will I be able to plug it in and my laptop will work? Obviously there won't be an OS on it so il have to buy windows 10 again but in theory this would work right? 
Would this be a smart thing to do or would I save time and money by taking it to a professional? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-12-13 22:47:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This has been the first fifa I've ever really got into so take it easy on me. Ive been changing my squad up alot but the past couple days [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/oKuk0) has been working well for me the past few days. 

  At the start of the match I switch to attacking, team press, and counter attack on the d pad(not to sure what this is called) which works great except if I give up the ball in the midfield I'm stuck with just my two center backs because monreal and Coleman are in the oppositions zone. Sometimes il try to move it up the side of the pitch and my full backs are in my wingers position.... What can I do to keep my full backs more in position?
  
  Also any recommendations for my squad? My next pick up is gonna be Rooney I think at cm to replace kante or ramsey

Edit: formatting </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been using Terrabotanicals for around 6 months now and I have been extremely pleased with their services. It's by far the cheapest source (for Canadians) with some of the strongest kratom I have came by. Everytime I ever have questions my emails have been responded to very promptly, usually within 10 minutes. 

Recently I had a problem with one of my orders not arriving. I usually received my package within 1-2 days even without tracking or express shipping, but this package took over a week so I knew something was up. I sent an email and Terrabotanicals shipped another package the next day. This package also failed to arrived in and I had to email them again. I was expecting to just have to cut my loses and start paying for tracking, but they sent another package and we're super apologetic! This one was with free tracking as well. I received my package the next day and was extremely pleased with their helpfullness. 

If anyone is looking for a good kratom vendor I would highly recommend Terrabotanicals. What an amazing company. </TEXT>

Ive only fed them 3 times throughout the flowering period though because it took me awhile to get the nutes. Would Ph have cause them to get crispy? Because I only started stabilizing the pH to around 6-6.5 on the last few waterings, I feel like that fucked with them. It's also been a really hot summer here with no ac.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Where are you located? I'm in Canada so I use a canada based vendor called Terrabotanicals. They have by far the best prices and quality kratom, my bags are always a little heavier. Before that I was using kratora just because they came in a nice bag, 8/10 quality and was cheap. But they were us based and I suffered on the shipping. I would recommend both https://www.terrabotanical.ca and http://www.kratora.com </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly the strains are alot similar to weed. Certain ones have different properties, but kratom is kratom. I like maeng da and borneo white. Maeng da is supposed to be made from the highest quality leaves taken from many plants, so it's powerful and high quality. Some strains are more stimulating and others are more sedating. There's tons of info over at /r/kratom as I could go on all day but this really isn't the proper sub. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So earlier on in the game I tried to do the fire support quest where you have to help Danse with ghouls. After killing all the ghouls (searched the surrounding area for a while) and trying to talk to him the only response he gave me was "check your fire, we've got hostiles". After some research I found this was a common glitch but couldn't find a ps4 fix. I just left it for then. 

Now I'm trying to complete the molecular level quest by going to the brotherhood of steel because I haven't even met them yet. This requires you to go to the Cambridge police station and help them just like before. This time I was able to talk to him and answer like 3 questions before mid sentence he yells "check your fire, we've got hostiles" all over again. Does anyone know a fix for consoles to this glitch. This is my first playthrough and I don't want to do it without ever meeting the brotherhood. 

Thanks to anyone who replies.

<TEXT> Anyone have any tips for making beats fully on the sp? I have the og and I use the resample method (if that makes sense?) where I end up having my full beat on one pad in the end. Problem is all my beats I've made so far come out very boom bap kinda style, that would have someone rapping over it. I want to progress into more intricate lofi beats that are more melodic and can be listened to without a rapper. How do you make your beats? Right now I'm using drum breaks because I find it hard to lay down my drums. Just any tips would be appreciated, if this type of post isn't allowed in this sub I have no problem with removing it.

<TEXT> I thought so, guess I just got unlucky. They're built by Yamaha so they really are quality units. There is a local guitar tech who told me he'd look into replacing the inputs for me so I'm not completely out of luck. Don't think il be going back to Steinberg after this though. Looking at the focusrite 4i4 for my next one if I can't get it repaired.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your first answer completly contradicts it's self

1. When the agency contacts you about a job, they usually give you a very high level explanation. 

If they give you a very high level explanation then why would they only tell you it's a laundry detergent commercial and that's it?

<TITLE> How to clean coils on a portable ac? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-30 21:45:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys, I'm a hvac student currently in second semester but we haven't gotten to refrigeration yet so try and bear with me. I picked up a 10 year old portable ac that wasn't working fully for really cheap just kind of as a project. The girl said it haven't been serviced ever and that it would run for about an hour only and only cool at average temps. I figured it probably just needs a really good cleaning. Fan runs great and everything. Only thing is the coils are literally welded into the tank of freon and I have no way of detaching them for easy cleaning. What is the best way to clean them without fully removing the coils?

<TEXT> Just got off the phone with Steinberg. The guy is saying it's a hardware issue. They only have a year long warranty and I bought it 13 months ago so I'm pretty much screwed. Yamaha is the company that repairs them and it costs around the same price as I new one to repair so it looks like I'm upgrading my interface.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys this is my first time playing fallout so be nice. I'm on my first playthrough and I'm at the point where Preston wants to retake the castle. I keep telling him to wait because I have alot of quests stacked and want to level up more before attempting. Only thing is most of my quest require me to report to Preston at the end and he won't talk to me about anything other than the castle. I've also read about glitches where you can't talk to Preston after completing this mission so now I'm a bit worried about doing it. What do you guys recommend I do or has anyone else had this problem? </TEXT>

Pretty much you put in your last time you smoked, how many cigarettes (I just thought of those like bowls) you smoke a day, and how much a pack cost (I just thought of a pack like a gram). Everyday I check it and seeing the numbers rise really helps keep me in line. I never really noticed how much I smoked untill now. Today is day 6 and Ive already skipped almost 50 bowls!! That's crazy to me! It also has many other cool features that help me out, I recommend it to anyone who's trying to kick the habit.  </TEXT>

It came without the power supply and faceplate but they arent needed as it runs on batteries and the faceplate is just for looks. Picked up a power supply for 20 bucks from Roland and they had the faceplate for 30 but I decided I didn't need it. 
One more thing I forgot to mention about the sx is you can use SD cards while the og is compact flash which can be tedious as it has a 1gb max(more than enough) and certain brands don't work with the sp.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If your trying to decide between og and sx the main differences are the speed of the workflow, fx and price. The og has a greatly slower work flow (probably 5x as slow, and annoying having to resample) but it also has a couple fx that are just too nasty to pass up, it's pretty hard to emulate the ogs vinyl Sim. Also I found that the og is usually cheaper than the sx, I picked mine up for 150. 
It's really what you want to do with it, are you going to mainly use it as a way of producing? Or just looking to get a new piece of equipment to mess around with?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well back at day 1 again... Been an everyday smoker for around 5 years, the last couple weeks have been pretty bad. I was literally waking at 5 in the morning the smoke bowls just so I could sleep again. Usually I ease off of it but this time I quit cold turkey. Last bowl was about 12 hours ago and I'm a mess right now. The anxiety is bad and I can't eat anything. These were expected but what I wasn't expecting was the constant nausea and feeling like I'm going to vomit. I've never had this before, tried taking a Tums but it didn't do much. Hope everyone's having a good day stay strong! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cool that's good to know! I had tried growing when I was in highschool but had no idea what I was doing and gave my seedling enough nutrients for an apple tree and killed it within a day so I really made sure I was taking it easy on them this time. I'm growing in [vigoro all purpose potting mix](http://m.homedepot.com/p/Vigoro-1-25-cu-ft-Potting-Mix-74337920/203715547).  Also using a generic 3-1-2 blend. Kinda cheaper out on somethings to stay on budget.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right now I'm growing in a space bucket type tote just using mostly hardware store supplys such as [vigoro all purpose potting mix](http://m.homedepot.com/p/Vigoro-1-25-cu-ft-Potting-Mix-74337920/203715547) and some generic 3-1-2 nutrients. Right now they are doing pretty great as far as I know under around 94 watts of cfl but I am hoping to add 150watts of led for flowering, but for my first grow I'm trying to keep it low budget and I've already exceeded that haha. 
Guess I got real lucky for my first grow as both these seeds werent feminized and I only planted the two! 
Edit: adding led at flowering not cfl </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to use fl studio and now that I have maschine I usually just do everything in maschine. It is possible. Sometimes I export to FL for mastering or more mixing but I usually end up just doing everything in maschine. Once you really get the controls down it makes everything really fast. I only have the mk2 but I'd imagine the studio would replace fl even better.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) First pick a scale, lets say for example we want the A major scale.

2) Find the "A" in the chart, only looking at the blue top letters for now. You can see its in the 5th column, 3rd row.

3) Look above and you will see its underneath a number, in our case its 3. This means that there are 3 sharps in the A major scale. Why sharps? Because the "A" is sitting in the "#" row. If it was in the "b's" row, it would mean there were 3 flats (Eb major scale).

4) So now we know that the A maj scale has 3 sharps, now we need to know which notes are sharps. This is where the red letters come in. You'll see underneath every blue letter is a red letter, these show which notes are sharpened or flattened in each scale. All we have to do is count backwards. So in our example of A maj, the sharpened notes are G, C and F.

5) And thats it, now we have the A major scale, it should look like this - A B C# D E F# G# A </TEXT>

<TITLE> Need help with a schematic diagram </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-09 03:01:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In school for Hvac right now first semester. My final assignment for electrical is to build an efficient schematic out of what my instructor gives me. 

Mine was "6 switches, 3 relays, 3 lights. All lights are energized when the circuit is at rest. Activating any relay will de-energize all lights." 

I know this is a long shot but would anyone be able to help me? I'm stumped. Already tried /r/electrical. I asked him a few more questions he said all the switches are single pole and I don't have to use all relay contacts. I could make it work with less things but can't incorporate all the switches. 

Anyone got any idea? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is the full problem given by my instructor: "6 switches, 3 relays, 3 lights. All lights are energized when the circuit is at rest. Energizing any of the relays will de-energize all lights."

I asked him a couple more questions today and all switches are single pole, all switches are open at rest and I don't have to use all the relay contacts. 

Edit: this is my final assignment for my electrical fundamentals course in hvac </TEXT>

I completely agree with you, the whole workflow of maschine makes a very unique sound and process to putting together patterns. I'm in love with it its really helped me progress. Honestly everytime I open maschine its something different. I'm still experimenting I only started a year ago haha. I really appreciate this comment man, I'm saving it for next time I'm in a slump haha </TEXT>

<TEXT> I purchased a used maschine about a year ago second hand and had a hard time getting it installed because some of the software was already activated on the guys dad's account. The guy who sold it to me gave me the login info for the account and I got it all running and activated on my account somehow. I recently got a new laptop when I went to activate it it wouldn't let me. I called naive instruments and they told me it was activated on the other guys account. Now when I try and log into the other guys account the password has changed. The guy isnt answering his phone (he could have a new number) and I have never got an answer from the email on the other account (tried emailing it when I first purchased). Now I am stuck with a maschine mk2 and no software. Does anyone have a serial I could buy off them? Is there any other way to get maschine software running? This really sucks. If I buy a komplete keyboard will it come with maschine?  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-12-15 15:55:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm currently a maschine user but have always wanted an mpc. I like the idea of not needing a laptop to create a whole track. Tried using the search bar multiple times but reddits search sucks. I'm looking for mpc owners to give me advice on which I should cop. Honestly I love the idea of a 2000xl it seems like the pinnacle of mpcs. I've ruled out the 2500 because I've done so research and alot of people say it doesn't have that mpc sound to it because they changed the hardware somehow. I also really like the idea of a 500 because it is so portable but it lacks the 16 pads and the screen is very small. That's why I think the 1000 is the best of both worlds. I'm looking for current owners that can give me advice on what to do and what they like about their mpc </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have one of these and the amount of work you have to do everytime you start it up just to trigger samples isn't worth it. I use it for the keys only since I got my maschine. It can be done but why not just use your keyboard?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on what you want out of your work flow. I personally do everything in maschine. Occasionally il export to ableton for more mixing but you can definitely do it all in maschine. It will take some time but just sitting down every day and fucking around with it will help you figure out how you want to go about it. You can find videos on YouTube of different work flows for maschine  </TEXT>

I've always thought you need a program like sound flower to record internal sounds into maschine but I've done some research and have seen a couple people in threads saying you can just use a input of your interface to record. I can't figure out of to route it in maschine though. Tried searching but unable to find and answer and I'm sure it's a simple answer too. Thanks to anyone who helps </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know it's kind of wierd that only Ontario smokes these and they're huge here. Some people do just put tobacco under the bowl but they call that "batch bowls". I don't really know the story about how they got so big but they do get you alot higher using less weed, which is a big reason why so many high school kids smoke them. Do get really addictive because of the nicotine and makes quitting 10 worse because you're essentially quitting weed and tobacco at the same time. The doctors in my town hate them because apparently it is waaay worse for your lungs to have weed and tobacco in your lungs at the same time as apposed to one or the other
Edit: the name for them is "poppers" or "pops"  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [these](http://imgur.com/6hQBHXM) You can find them at any head shop in Ontario they were really big in the small town I come from. They make it easier because you can just stamp the weed into the bowl after you pack your tip. I smoked them for a few months and they do get you a hell of alot higher but they're terrible on your lungs and alot more addictive then just weed </TEXT>

<TITLE> My apartment has no vents. Am I at risk for carbon monoxide? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-24 15:35:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I live in an old building that has no vents. There are two fans that go outside I think (kitchen and bathroom), and lots of windows. The area I live in gets very cold in the winter (ottawa) and I can't really have my windows open all day. Over the weekend I never left the apartment because I wasn't feeling well and didn't have any windows open. I haven't bought a co detector because I believe the company I am leasing from should provide it (minto) as it is a law to have one in Ottawa. Since this weekend I have just always kept a window open but I won't be able to do this all winter. Not sure if this is even the right sub but someone direct me if not. 
I am a male, 19, Caucasian. Also if someone could give me any signs to watch for carbon monoxide poisoning that would be helpful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know what you are talking about but the speaker he was mixing on wasn't actually that bad, it's still a 250 monitor. Ali was mixing in mono, that was his main point. Part of his point was that it was a "crappy speaker" but I can tell you right now low passing your bass isn't going to bring it out more. Bass gets most of its punch from the higher end like the 200-300hz range. If you cut all the high end out its gonna make it sound really muddy and fuck up the mix  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Poor circulation? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-22 04:50:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am 18 years old, Male and I believe I have poor circulation. In the past four or five months my arms and legs fall asleep alot easier (go all tingly) in sometimes normal positions. Just this past month my cuts have been healing alot slower. Usually my cuts are gone in a few days but I have had cuts now for 3 weeks. They go red and don't fully heal. I also have very shallow breathing alot of the time.
 I plan on seeing a doctor soon but just moved away for school I'm January so my doctor isn't near. It is also hard to find time with work. I also smoke alot of marijuana and I think this might cause my poor circulation. 
My height is 6 ft and I weigh 145 lbs. Also I should add I have depression and anxiety issues so this could be all in my head. Which happens alot but this time I have multiple symptoms so I am a little more concerned. 
Thank you </TEXT>

For instance the drums will come through but the vocals and other instruments are distorted and not playing properly. I have replaced the needle, adjusted the weight of the arm and switched the cartridge with my dad's and the same problem still happens. I know my dad's cartridge and needle work because my records play perfectly on his turntable. I will probably end up returning it or bringing it in to be fixed but I work 75 hour weeks and do not have the time right now.

<TEXT> Looking to get into vinyl sampling, not really interested in scratching at this point. Il just get down to the main questions. 
1. Does the turntable matter? Or can I pick up an old turntable off my dad and buy a new needle? Or would the quality suffer? 
2. Do USB turntables suffer quality? 
3. If I get a turntable attach it to a phono preamp and then get the adapted to my laptop will I be able to rip/sample right into fl studio or ableton? Thanks for any help in advance I'm kind of new to this! Plus this is my first post on reddit! </TEXT>
