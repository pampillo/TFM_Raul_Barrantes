It's amazing what games can do for people. Really. It's just something about this game that really drives me. It makes me want to accomplish so many things in life, as corny as it sounds.

+ Good players will be good, regardless of the heroes they select
+ Bad players will be bad, regardless of the heroes they select
+ A team that consists of good players will defeat a bad team, no matter what their opponents are using.
+ The people who blindly 'believe in the meta' without understanding the reasons why are no different from those trying to conduct a holy war. Period.

<TEXT> I still disagree. And we can see by votes on who agrees more with you and I. It's not high elo? It's higher than most. You don't have to be GM and top 500 for it to be considered high elo. Says who by the way? You? I'm not bragging and even masters isn't easy to get to even not playing mercy. She's not outclassed. Not everyone can aim with Ana and not everyone is good at Lucio. Just because it's not what the "pros" play doesn't mean it should be frowned upon playing mercy. Period.  </TEXT>

She says to a man next to her: ''The driver just insulted me!'' The man says: ''You go up there and tell him off. Go on, I'll hold your monkey for you.''

<TEXT> You can go into options under gameplay and switch off kill cam. This will skip the kill cam completely and allow you to spectate your teammates of your choice until you respawn. Until Blizzard fixes this, it's a good way to bypass it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> (I forgot to mention my timezone is central.) Hello, I'm Zach. I'm 22 years of age. I'm a pretty laid back guy and love to laugh. Now that I've gotten a PS4, I pretty much don't have anyone to play with. Yeah, soloing online is alright for awhile, but then it just gets kinda boring without anyone to play with and that's why I'm here. I'm very easy to get along with and also an open minded gamer. I play on the PS4 as of right now and play GTA V, Plants vs Zombies Garden Warfare, and Rocket League. I will also be getting Black Ops III when it arrives and will be buying Battlefront as well. Feel free to ask any questions or PM me. I'd love to have a friend to get to know and play with.  </TEXT>

I'm not looking for the hey, how're you, nothing much -end of conversation- type of person. Someone who loves to talk and really is looking for a legitimate friendship. Male or female, I don't mind. I like to go to the beach, go out for dinner, bowling, anything really. Even Netflix on a Friday night. I'm a very mature person but I know how to have fun too. All in all, I'm really looking for a friend to spend time with and get to know. Write me if you're sincerely interested. Thank you!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is anyone else getting stuttering in-game on Windows 10? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-02 01:48:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I apologize in advance for my noobness and don't know if this is right place for it. My PC came pre-installed with Windows 10 and the site said Windows 8. Every game I try to play, it will be fine and 2 seconds later, it stutters and I drop frames like crazy. Goes back to normal for about 5 seconds and then does it all over again and continues. I've read quite a few forums and couldn't find a solution and I've tried everything. I was thinking about getting a Windows 8.1 disc. Those of you who are/were on Windows 10, are you experiencing the same issue? Is Windows 10 lacking certain updates or patches? 

Edit (forgot the specs): Intel Core i5-4690k CPU @3.50GHz 
16 GB DDR3 
GTX 970 4GB graphics card 
1TB HD SATA III

Im often told that Ive lived a life years ahead of myself, so if you enjoy being deep.. That's me. Dont be intimidated, though.

I really enjoy video gaming. I play some Blizzard games and love Nintendo. Oh, Im also real open-minded, so you wont have to worry about me being judgmental about anything.

<TEXT> Hi, 

I'm Zach. I'm 21. I love to talk and meet new people. I haven't had much time to meet or talk to someone and actually get to know someone. On top of that, I haven't really had much luck finding someone who actually holds a conversation. With that being said, I'm a nice guy and would love to have a friend. If you're interested, you can either reply on this post or send me a PM. Thank you for taking your time to read this. Have a great day! :)

<TEXT> I know they're dormant because the growth is slowed and haven't changed much. Some traps also have a red coloration to them when dormant. You can tell the Sarracenia's are dormant because they're completely red. 

For putting them into dormancy, I grow my plants outside. They were getting 9+ hours of sunlight each day and I watered them frequently as the the heat in Florida can burn plants quickly, so I keep an eye out on them. They go into dormancy when they get less light. The plants know to shut off somewhat and to slow growth because they're essentially resting. They probably get 5-6 hours now. Another factor is temperature. It's now 40 degrees less here and is colder at night. You want to keep them in colder temperatures, however, if you're growing them outside and if you have a long period of freezing, you might want to bring them in. I've heard a couple days of freezing is okay though. You want to keep the waterings a lot less frequent during dormancy. Don't let it completely dry out though. I hope any of this information helps!  </TEXT>

Something I've always done was acclimate them as well. I'm very cautious about leaving them in full sun when you first get the plant. I leave them for an hour one day. Two the next. Each time I'll put them in a shady spot. Eventually I leave them out all day. YourRealMom hit the nail on the head.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not the company that sends these out. From what I've heard, this vendor is actually really great. It's the stores that carry them that give them absolutely no care. They sit, sit and sit without any water or sun. Each one of these plants that come in usually end up dying because most of them I've looked at are dead while in store so they just push the dead ones to the back. When they get new plants in, these plants are healthy, so that's what I mean by "save". It's the store's fault, not the vendor in my case.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends, I believe. What I have done to successfully achieve dew:
I keep mine a lot more moist than the pitcher plant and Venus fly trap. I have mine growing in pure spaghnum so it dries out a lot more quickly, so it has an increased watering schedule. I have my plant in full sun, and that's the key factor. Enough light! It gets 6 hours a day. Also, I just got this plant so it took a week or two to spring back to life!  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello I'm Zach Westerfield. I'm 21. My teeth are getting to the point to where they are starting to rot out. I have a condition where I have no roots. Basically, my roots are all flat which means my teeth would fall out quicker than a normal person's would. My teeth are constantly killing me and I'm afraid I'm going to get an infection. I brush my teeth daily but my family has poor dental hygiene. I don't smile anymore because I'm afraid people will see my teeth. I've lost faith in myself. My self-esteem has gone out the door and I don't feel like myself anymore. I need root canals done, bridges, fillings, some tooth extracations, some crowns, a little bit of everything, (don't know what else), possibly even taken all teeth out which I really don't want. Basically most of all of them need some type of work done on them because of my root condition. I already have 2 teeth that's already about to fall out. I can't afford to get this work done. I need help. Soon. Any donation is appreciated. Thank you very much for reading my story. Any donation would be helpful! Thank you and God Bless. Here's my GoFundMe page: http://www.gofundme.com/zacharywesterfield </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've had an examination of my teeth and they told me all of my teeth needed to be pulled because I have flat roots and they were going to eventually fall out 1-2 years and that was a year ago. They gave me the other option of having work done on them (root canals, teeth needed pulled and implanted because some are completely destroyed already.) I had Medicare at the time as well. Now I don't qualify for it because I live in a different state and most of all of my money goes on bills and can't afford it and save up for a trip to the dentist, trust me, I would if I could. So it's either get all my teeth pulled or try to get help, really. I wished I had another option. It's not just one tooth, like you said. All of my teeth are starting to rot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm 20, I work. (I don't get dental through work either) I make too much to qualify for Medicare, but not enough to have my own dental insurance and I can't get it. My teeth are getting to the point to where they are starting to rot out. My teeth are constantly killing me and I'm afraid I'm going to get an infection inside my mouth. I brush my teeth daily but my family doesn't have good teeth so it's probably genetics. I don't smile anymore because I'm afraid people will see my teeth. My self esteem as gone way down hill and I don't feel like myself anymore. I need root canals done, fillings, some tooth extracations, some crowns, a little bit of everything and 2000 (wild guess) should cover all expenses. I need help. Soon. Any donation is appreciated. Thank you to anyone who is willing to help. Here's the link to my GoFundMe page: http://www.gofundme.com/zacharywesterfield </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Request] pizza for me and my 2 kids </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have two kids, they're my angels. I lost my job at the call center I worked at. They laid of 200 people and I was unfortunately one of them. My check was going on food but now that I have to pay that all in rent because my check is going to be less, I have no food. I'm in a panic and I'm trying my best to not breakdown. a pizza or two would get me and my kids through the next 1-2 days while I figure out something immediate and while I try to get back on my feet. If anyone is willing to help, that would be so kind and I'd be very grateful as well as my kids would, thank you for taking the time to read my short and sad story. We live in Florida and we have Papa Johns available for delivery. </TEXT>

This is wonderful news as these plants grow in a 70 mile radius. These are beautiful, unique plants that deserve to have crucial laws protecting them.

<TEXT> Hi, I'm Zach. I'm 20. I love meeting new people. I consider myself funny, I love making people laugh. I'm a very good listener. I'm a non-judgmental person that loves when people tell me about their day or something that happened to them that particular day. I'm a very down to earth person that enjoys life. A best friend would make it even more enjoyable. I love music, Netflix, animals, the beach, pretty much anything to occupy me. I'm really mature and I know how to handle myself as well. With that being said, if you're interested in having a loyal, honest, "count on me" best friend, please message me or comment. We'll see where it goes. Oh, and it doesn't matter male or female either. :) </TEXT>

To install: Go to settingsgeneralkeyboard. Then go to keyboard and hit add new keyboard. You'll see SwiftKey under Third-Party keyboards. Tap SwiftKey. Then hit SwiftKey - Swiftkey and allow full access and hit allow. Then from there go to messages. Go to an existing text or create a new message and the stock iOS keyboard will come up.

Thoughts on this pot? Also, I have a question as far as dormancy goes. It stays pretty much warm here year-round then gets down to 50's-mid 40's in winter hence Florida weather. Will they still go dormant?  Here are some pictures:

As for the guy saying we kill our own crew members, we do not. It's strictly prohibited. We've had to kick 2 NEW members that were obviously completely ignorant to our ONLY rule is to respect your crew members. They are gone and they got on here and said things on my post to make our crew look bad. That's all I have to say. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Venus traps   Pitcher plant </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-05 04:30:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello, I got my venus fly traps and pitchers from Lowe's. I'm currently using all the soil which was included in original packaging for all plants. They were doing fine at first, and now, it looks wilted and some of the traps have gone black. Some of them are still green though. This is my setup. This is the light I purchased: http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B001P05V6M/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1407204716 sr=1-1 pi=SY200_QL40

I have the plants a few inches from the light. I give the plants of at least 8+ hours of artificial light with about 4+ hours of filtered sunlight in a windowsill then put them back under the light I bought. I give them nothing but distilled water and only that type of water. I never let the soil get too dry, I usually water every 2-3 days watering them in a plate so they can soak up from the bottom. The first photo I have a question about. This is one mentioned about going black. I also have a smaller venus fly trap in with this one planted next to it (don't know if that matters) Is this one healthy? Also, how often do you water the traps and pitchers? Can also anyone tell me what type of pitcher I have? (Both pictures) Also, do I need to repot any of these? Do I need to do anything to keep them healthy or are they fine?
First plant: http://imgur.com/Yuqt90q
Second venus: http://imgur.com/pm5r5wx
Third plant beside wilted one: http://imgur.com/DVbEjXy
My other pitcher I started from a baby: http://imgur.com/Hm7wmxv (what type of pitcher is this?)
