<TEXT> I agree that the rogue reward makes sense in paladin, but Galvadon isn't all that flavourful for rogues with the current adapts, but yeah if he was in Rogue he should have a strong battlecry that benefits from bouncing, maybe adapt all your minions three times? Works with stealth minions so you're guaranteed a board when your turn comes around, and synergises with bouncing due to the powerful battlecry.

Edit: That battlecry would probably be broken in Rogue, but you get the idea. </TEXT>

<TITLE> It's becoming easier and easier to remove amulets; they can no longer be thought of as "semi-permanent" </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-31 22:40:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In vanilla Shadowverse there were select cards that had "destroy an amulet" and these minions had pretty heavy stat penalties. They were tech cards, and seldom saw play at all, primarily because there wasn't really any amulet that was dominating everything else to a level that warranted it.

In DE we got Odin, an 8pp 4/3 that banishes one thing, which can be an amulet. Odin was always a tech card. You played him because you had a specific card in mind that you wanted to counter, be it Mordecai, or you could use it to get rid of any one thing that was posing a threat at the time.

In RoB we got Bahamut, a 10pp 13/13 that destroys everything, amulets included. It was played a good amount as a control tool. At this point, high value amulets are still playable, but at great risk to being destroyed by Bahamut a couple of turns later.

Now we have lightning blast, a 10pp (let's face it) dragoncraft spell that banishes your opponents board, amulets included.

My point is that over the expansions, amulets (that were supposed to be "tempo loss + value over time + hard to remove" things), are becoming more and more risky to develop a deck around, and that worries me, because I love amulets, they have some of the most interesting effects in the game.

**tl:dr**
*Amulets are easier than ever to remove, removing them no longer has to be a tech choice thanks to Bahamut and Lightning Blast. They can no longer be thought of as "semi-permanent", especially the expensive ones.* </TEXT>

<TEXT>  To play a game that is no longer fun is idiotic on my part

More people on this sub need to realize this. The biggest incentive the devs have to make changes is if they lose players, they've already shown that they don't really care about proper feedback, much less all the anger on reddit. If you're not having fun then don't play.

Edit: I hope the game becomes fun later down the line, and it'd be great to play then, but putting yourself through something you don't currently enjoy, especially if it's something you do TO enjoy yourself, is just silly. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  "i have it worse than you/ you have no right to be depressed"

It is difficult for people who haven't had a mental illness to appreciate just how debilitating a mental illness can be. It can be difficult to compare physical and mental ailments, so saying "I have it worse therefore you have no right to be depressed" is an invalid statement, at least in my opinion.

People in psychological distress of any severity deserve help, no less than those with physically detectable problems. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think Astaroth's Reckoning (or however you spell it) needs to be changed in some way. The counter play to Prince of Darkness is to start SMOrcing, but the possibility of that card being in their hand means you can't ignore any minions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like Rowen needs a greeting that actually.. greets. Reporting for duty seems like something you say to a superior, not an opponent.

EDIT: Now that I think about it, "Don't let it get to you" isn't an apology either, but probably the best BM in the game. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Can someone explain the "custom mouse controls" option in the steam version of the game? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-29 02:48:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> From what I can gather it has a contextual meaning depending on what you're clicking, for example, right clicking on a allied minion will evolve it, and right clicking on a card in your hand will play it. But it also makes the hand zoom in automatic on mouse over, but doesn't undo it when you take the mouse away for some reason.

Also, what does the sticky cursor option do?

Thanks if anyone can answer this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On the mobile app, go to "more" and then "device link". Follow the instructions and then it will email you a code that you can then put into the steam version. On the main menu in the steam version (the one where it says click to continue or something similar) there should be a "link data" option. Go on that and put the code you got in the email from there and the accounts will be linked! </TEXT>
