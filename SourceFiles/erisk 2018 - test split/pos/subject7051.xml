<TEXT> A reserve is a resource that is economically feasible. The two words are not synonymous. The point I am making is that oil and gas are running out and without economically viable renewables, i.e. Cheaper than coal, the tendency will be to go back to relying on coal for energy. I'm not saying it's right, I personally think it's an environmentally irresponsible thing to do, but if it's cheaper than renewables, that's where we'll see the industry swing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Current reserves are put at 1000 billion barrels. Currently consumption is 31 billion barrels per year. While new technologies are continually transforming resource petroleum into reserve petroleum, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that our petroleum reserves will be depleted in the next 50 years. Coal reserves, however, are estimated to last over 200 years. 

edit: These are 2009 numbers, 2016 projections are 1700 billion barrels of oil and consumption has risen to 35 billion barrels a year. That puts world reserves as lasting 48.57 years.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They are stored sealed off the line just like you would receive it in the store. We'd just walk from the lab out to the line and pick out what we wanted. Then we'd store the refrigerated samples in the refrigerated warehouse and "abuse" samples in a separate location in the warehouse (logistically impossible to keep two weeks of milk from each line in the lab). If milk goes bad sooner it's likely a cleanliness issue or pasteurization temp issue. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My friend left her husband with whom she had two children. After a few months she started dating a man who regularly told her that if she didn't have kids they could do things "like regular couples do". She refused to take this a sign that the relationship was doomed. Fast forward six months and she finds out he's an abusive closet alcoholic that deliberately antagonizes her children and steals from her. He even stole her little girl's teddy bear she had since birth because he though she was too old for it at age 6. If you are going to date again you need to make sure that your man is a good fit for your kids as well. They have to be the number ones in your life. He needs to go.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, you came here for justification of your actions and back-up in your thinking that your girlfriend is in the wrong. You refuse to accept the actual productive advice that you are, indeed, the person who was wrong in this situation. You have a fantasy that people in relationships always respect each other's feelings and never say anything harsh and cruel to each other. I'm sorry to have to break it to you, but that just isn't the case. People in relationships can get nasty when their feelings are hurt, and bad stuff is sad when you are mad. As stated above, if you aren't a child you accept this and are able to move past it. I highly suggest that you apologize to your girlfriend and then grow up.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not talking down to you, and I'm not sure why you think that. It's obvious you aren't in a good place, people who self harm aren't either. It's a form of self-medication, much like emotional eating or binge drinking. The self-harmer masks emotional pain by causing physical pain. Is it healthy? No, of course not, but neither is excessive drinking or binge eating to cope with emotional pain. 


People do what they need to do to survive and manage. Even excessive drinking, emotional eating and self-harm are better than committing suicide. I guess my point is that just because you don't understand it doesn't mean it doesn't help them cope. I don't self-harm. My brother did. He eventually stopped, when he got the help he needed. 


It is not for anyone else to determine what works when coping. I did judge you as a bastard earlier and that was wrong, but it makes me angry when people who suffer from depression turn on each other instead of supporting each other. 


People who suffering from depression need professional help. I've seen to many people try to cope on their own either attempt suicide, or succeed. This includes myself. It wasn't until after my almost successful suicide attempt that I realized I needed help. Professional help from people who knew what they were doing. 


I have supported many friends and family members through their dark depression hours. All I can tell them, and what I am telling you, is that it does get better. It will, I promise. 


I'm not going to fight or argue with you anymore. Just take care of yourself and do what you need to do to get healthy and happy and I'm going to go do the same.


I truly, sincerely wish you all the best in your battle.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Listen, I'm sorry you seem so miserable still. It's obvious to someone that has suffered from clinical depression for over twenty years that even though you claim that you've conquered the beast, you're still battling. The "miserable" part is observation, the bastard part is my addition based on your behavior towards others. 


You don't get to tell others what works for them. What works for you won't work for everyone. I'm so sorry you feel like nothing works for you, but the simple fact of the matter is that for many people, including myself, the anti-depressants you knock saved my life. They save many lives. 


Please try to get additional help for your depression and let your friends and family help you. Pushing them away is not a victory or triumph of depression, it's you sinking deeper. Rejecting all efforts by everybody, including your Doctor is you sinking deeper. I know you don't feel this way and you are probably going to be abusive towards me over it, but I have seen too many people go down that path, and a few of them never came back. 


Just try to take care of YOURSELF, don't worry so much about how other people wrestle their demons when yours have you in a headlock. 

Best of luck.  </TEXT>

He has to work from home, part time (she can't work) and if the baby starts getting fussy, even if she's home and he's trying to work, he has to get up and deal with it. She cannot be left alone with her own child because she "can't handle it". She refuses to get help because she doesn't believe in traditional medicine. My BIL always looks tired. I know it's hard, but you need to firmly ask her to get help. My husband had to do that for me.  </TEXT>

Since your step-father sees all the worst case scenarios of farrier work (and to be honest, neglectful owners that blame the farrier) of course it's easy to paint the entire profession with the same dirty brush.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> People always assume I am a horrible person for telling them I hate (and I really fucking do) my brother and my mother. My mother was a selfish, narcissistic, alcoholic, drug-addicted bully and my brother was worse. After I got pregnant with my second son I couldn't handle the abuse anymore so I cut off contact. I was called selfish and told that I was bitch who thought she was better than everyone else (my poor father got to be the go-between). The day I found out she died, while conflicted, what I felt most was a sense of relief. She's gone! Dead! Best thing she ever did for me. Now if my brother would drop dead I'd be OH so happy.  </TEXT>

When we had my dog's cyst removed they told us it would be several hundred dollars for pathology. We refused. She's 11 years old. If she DOES have cancer we won't be so selfish that we put her through chemo. There IS a line that every owner needs to draw, but refusing emergency vet care is unacceptable. Anyone who TRULY loves their pets could not watch then suffer and refuse to take them to the vet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mrs. Judgemental, actually. I'm going to spend my time and money taking care of my herd. And if one of them gets sick I will march them into the vet without hesitation. If I had to give up an animal to ensure proper treatment, I would. Allowing an animal to suffer is disgusting. I don't care how poor you are, allowing any living being to suffer because of selfish greed is unacceptable. If you can't afford the vet bill, nobody is calling you a shitty human. Avoiding the problem and pretending it doesn't exist when an animal is clearly suffering makes you a shitty person. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly? I don't care much for people. I keep my world simple, honest and open people and many creatures. I would rather spent money saving the life of a beloved pet as opposed to a random human being who may or may not be a shitty person. I work hard for what I have, it is my right to spend my money on people over animals. However, I am Canadian and as such, I pay taxes to sustain a healthcare system that I rarely access. I believe it is our duty to pay into a system that benefits all of us, even the less fortunate, the unemployed, people on welfare, etc. so I believe that I can spend my money on the creatures (that bring more far more joy than the vast majority of people have) and not feel an ounce of guilt. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, my eldest eighteen. He's been dumped twice in his life and I had to hold him while he cried for hours. He's been with his current girlfriend for three years, who is also a straight A student and they are both attending the same college. He works full time and finds the time to engage his little brother in various activities. My youngest is twelve, and I'm relatively positive he has no girlfriends that he's stalking. So for both my children I'm going to have to say that the amount of girls they have hurt stands at a big 'ol ZERO. And when people say they "Fucked up their first kid", it's not in a I-raised-a-serial-killer type way. It's in a I-made-a-way-bigger-deal-outta-that-than-necessary type way. There are failures as parents that don't incite a child to become a mass murderer. You just maybe yell too much or spoil them too much, but you learn from your first one, and that's why second siblings seem to get away with so much. We've learned what to make a big deal out of and what not to.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My family history is littered with heart disease, stroke, substance abuse and mental health issues. I made it out relatively normal and decided the best thing I could do for my kids was set them up for success, which effectively meant avoiding everything my parents did. I loved them as a kid but now I realize they were the world's shittiest role models. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My parents cooked rich, fatty foods and we never had veggies (unless they were in a can, blech). No portion control was taught and my brother and I were never encouraged to exercise or anything. Their parent modeling was not positive. I hit three hundred pounds at 29. Got my shit together and started eating right and my kids eat great, too! My 12 year old makes himself salad all the time. Loves fish and healthy stirfrys. Vegetables never last in our house, but my kids still have candy leftover from last Easter. They see so much more than we think they do.  </TEXT>

All the rooms in my house are painted different colors. BRIGHT colors. When I was still with my NMom and Nbrother I could never have anything of sentimental value because as soon as they got mad at me they would destroy it. I still don't make strong sentimental attachments to things (or people for that matter). My room was plain as well. My mother even kept the sheets that were taken into police custody for evidence when I was raped by a babysitter at age six. And put them on my bed. Had the evidence number and everything on them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I personally think it's a stupid line. I didn't need to forgive my mother for being a toxic, abusive drunk to get peace, I just needed the bitch out of my life completely. She died three years ago of cancer, the fact that she spent her last days suffering as much as she made me suffer gave me more peace than forgiveness ever could. Some things are unforgivable. </TEXT>

He brought a backpack full of books and games over to his friend's house one time and slipped the pocket knife in to show his friend, who is eight. He forgot his backpack there and it took a couple of weeks to get it back (they were on holidays). When his mom returned the backpack she asked if we knew our son had a knife. We told her that we were aware he had a knife, we gave it to him, but not aware he had brought it to his friend's. She told us that her son snooped through my son's backpack, found the knife and that she didn't want her son exposed to that sort of thing. She won't allow our son to play with hers any longer. Over a silly two and half inch long pocket knife.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey! I lost 120 lbs a few years back and kept if off, I just wanted to give you the heads up that it often takes a long time for the skin to firm up (if it ever does). After two kids and a 120 lb weight loss a tummy tuck was basically a non-option! Keep up the good work and remember that you WILL have good days and bad days and then you will have awful days and MONTHS, but you always have to stay true to yourself and your goals. If you keep that in mind ANYONE can make their goals a reality. The 30 lb weight loss looks great on you, just remember, though, you were beautiful before and you're beautiful now! </TEXT>

<TEXT> For people with knee issues a stationary bike (or regular bike) and the pool are great exercise as neither is full weight-bearing. The most important thing to remember is that just because you have one bad day doesn't mean you should give up. Have a bad day. Eat the chocolate cake, eat the ice cream. Try to limit portions of bad foods. The next day you go back to eating good. Eating good 5 out of seven days is still better than eating bad 7 out of 7 days. It's important to keep healthy foods around you at all times, so when the temptation strikes, you can eat that instead of the bad stuff (I carried a bag of carrots in my purse). To relieve stress yoga is great. It's gentle and you work at your own pace. Even walking is a great stress relieving exercise. It doesn't have to be a fancy exercise. It just has to be an exercise you will do! Hope she continues her journey (It never really ends). </TEXT>

They use the gatherings and meetings as an excuse to get hammered and stay out all night. It's destroyed three marriages because of philandering, my friends being in of them. It's a disgusting Chapter and I can't help but think of all Freemasons as losers and alcoholics now. It's nice to see that there are other chapters out there like this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They do testing for Down's by Amniocentesis. It carries an approximately 1 in 200 risk of miscarriage and it isn't used unless they have a reason to suspect the baby is abnormal. Usually something shows up on sonogram. But sometimes Down's syndrome kids are healthy aside from the Down's so the typical things that show up as warning signs such as heart defects aren't there. Women start feeling a connection to a baby very early. To abort after 15 or 20 weeks would be devastating to most, and considering the advances in medicine, and hopefully society in general, there is no reason why a baby with Down's syndrome can't lead a healthy, fulfilling life. </TEXT>

Luckily we are the perfect examples! He just got back from his Senior's trip to Paris and France, so he really had the opportunity to grow. He just got his license and we bought him a cheap car with the understanding that he pays for his own gas. And he always has to tell us where he's going (which I feel is common courtesy). We don't shy away from subjects, we face them head on. He was caught watching porn at age fourteen and instead of freaking out we told him that he needed to be more careful because he has a brother six years younger. It's about balance and honesty. They are going to do bad shit. It's better that they learn moderation and responsibility early. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As woman who suffers from depression and whose husband felt helpless, just like you do, YOU NEED TO GET HER HELP. My husband made the appointment for me and dragged me in. He said I needed to get help or he didn't know if he could stay. And he was ABSOLUTELY right. I know his actions may get criticized but it made me realize that my depression didn't only affect me but him and our children, too. If she won't get help you REALLY need to think about your own well being. Your number one priority should be yourself, and it honestly sounds like you have done all you can for her short of physically dragging her to the doctor. It's not fair for you to have to keep suffering at the hands of someone who refuses to help herself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> People don't realize that treating HIV now is akin to diabetes. Not cureable, totally manageable and people rarely die from it anymore because the anti-retrovirals have come SO far. Literally from handfuls of meds that gave you a few years to a one pill a day regiment that adds decades to life AND significantly improves your quality of life. It also seems a lot of people ASSUME that HIV is only contracted by unprotected sexual contact, but in reality there are people who did not lead high risk lifestyles that have contracted it. Honestly, someone who is forthright about there HIV status from the being is giving you something you don't get on first dates often, COMPLETE HONESTY. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm just going to put it out there that I'm Canadian. Our school system, while it has it's faults, embraces differences and encourages all facets of learning. I have an 11 year old with "behavioral" issues who is treated as a valuable member of his class. My 17 year old loves his teachers and they have gone out of their way to help him on several occasions. I don't find schools authoritarian at all. There are rules that are put in place for protection of the kids, and I have not seen any of the ridiculous rules enforced here like they American news reports. My kids can bring butter knives to school for their lunch and can bring medication without a drug arrest. A consensual hug is not sexual assault here. So when I say our children are our future it's because here they ARE. And the good ones far out weight the bad ones who think "Reality TV" is reality.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm stating my opinion. You are trying to prove me wrong. There's a disconnect between our two statements. She may or may not identify with LGBT. She is most definitely a monster. My point is that people who argue strongly against the LGBT lifestyle, as we've seen with countless politicians, are actually rejecting something within themselves. They are rejecting a part of themselves they have been taught to loathe. The may or may not be the case, but as I stated it is my opinion and the feeling that I get from this story. I have survived a molestation myself, so believe it or not. I'm trying to be supportive and find arguing semantics over the wording of supportive post rather tedious. </TEXT>

She always thought that because they never fought in front of the children that even though they were miserable for years, the kids would never be the wiser. It wasn't until her 7 year old realized (from me and my husband) that mommies and daddies kiss and hug each other and asked my friend why her and her Daddy never kissed, that she realized she had robbed her kids of seeing a healthy relationship between two people. Staying together "for the kids" is so much more damaging than you could ever imagine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right now, with MH370, no one knows if it crashed, if it was hijacked, stolen, borrowed, abducted by aliens, sucked into a portal, OR ANYTHING. And it's been ten days. At the very least, telling the story of the SAR is going to be an intriguing mess, no matter when, or the state in which, this plane is found.  </TEXT>

We are working on day FOUR here and no one is any closer to locating this aircraft. I'm not saying that there isn't a HUGE, concentrated effort going on, it must be so frustrating for them out there, searching and not finding anything. </TEXT>

Though I love him dearly, it was very hard (his father and I are still together and have his younger brother together, my fifth grader). We have openly told my eldest that he was unplanned (though a HUGE joy to us) and that there are things we wish we would've been able to do before children. Like travel. We tell him (and have been telling him for years) that we don't care IF he's having sex, we just care that he's being smart about it. </TEXT>

My husband was injured so severely he had to have surgery to repair fractures in his face. We had to move because the man that assaulted him was our next door neighbor and did so while our ten year old son watched. It's just such a relief to have it all done. </TEXT>

They have emotions (sorry, firm believer in that, if you don't believe a turtle has emotions, watch them get mad when they don't get food when they beg). It's so sick the lack of empathy. Like I said, I felt sick to my stomach when Chuck got soft shell. We scrubbed him, dry docked him, kept a close eye on him and AGONIZED. I was so scared he would die, even though he remained feisty. Eventually he healed very well, but I keep a very close eye on his tank and shell, lesson learned!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's good! College is tough for some young adults when they aren't used to making decisions for themselves. For the record, I'm not a teenage girl hater. Most of the reason I'm relieved I had boys is I had a terrible mother and I was worried that I would continue the cycle. I'm also not incredibly feminine and don't do bullshit or drama, so a teenage girl would have been a nightmare. I hope college is going well for you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, I do. Luckily, I don't have to deal with the fallout of their bad decisions on an everyday level. Just societal. My mother was a severe narcissist who doted on my brother so I was lucky enough to have to become a very dependent woman. He is incredibly dependent person, so it does go the other way. I'm not saying these kinds of statements are always from young girls, but so many of them are. My son had a young woman in Grade 11 ask what the Holocaust was. I was absolutely incredulous. </TEXT>

The good people will weed themselves from the bad. Let them talk, because they are just making themselves look like the bitter old bitties that they are.

<TEXT> You have to look at the ROOT of what acting out is. Acting out is a cry for attention. With children even negative attention is attention. They are doing ANYTHING they can do to get your attention. A lot of families have very high expectations for behavior but do not ever acknowledge when their children are behaving good. They expect it. They never praise the good, we always punish the bad. With children, they begin to realise that if they want a parents attention, they need to act badly because the good behavior is ignored. This needs to change. If you want good behavior from your children, make sure that you reward it even in small ways, such as praise and rewards. My son, who is 11 has had behavioral problems for 8+ years and it wasn't until we moved to a reward for good behavior model that he did a 180 in his behavior. </TEXT>

I feel like I SHOULD feel guilty for being relieved she's dead, but the ACTUAL guilt just really isn't there. She died of cancer, too. My husband says that maybe that was karma. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is exactly the part that I mourn. I lost my "good" parent, my Dad, in 2008. And while it was a bit of a shock to stumble across her obituary, I wasn't surprised no one let me know. She told her sister and mother that she cut ME out of HER life because I was a drug addict/alcoholic that wouldn't let her help me (Sigh, lies, you know the drill). The only thing that REALLY bothers me is that neither one my parents lived past their 61st birthday. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In a little over a month and a half you'll be gone five years. I can't believe it. Sometimes it feels like you've been gone for an eternity, sometimes it feels like yesterday. I think about you every single day. Not one goes by where I don't miss you. It seems I always see I joke I know you'd like, or a fishing or golf related item that I would've bought you for Father's Day or your birthday. You would've been 65 this year. The day after I turned 37 and four days after your oldest grandson turned 17. He's gotten so big. Both the boys have. They miss you so much, too. I miss you for them. My heart aches when I see their pain. As the anniversary quickly approaches I wonder if it ever gets better. Will it ever hurt less? Will I ever not regret that our last words were spoken in anger? Do you know how much I love you?  </TEXT>
