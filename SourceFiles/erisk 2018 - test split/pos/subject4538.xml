<TEXT> Thank you for writing all that out. I totally feel the same regarding the robot thing and the bit about luxury cars. I could live pretty simply, just working little jobs forever, but I know that's not financially responsible. I'm not "supposed" to be content with a simple life, or living in the woods or something - I'm supposed to always be working toward something better. But I have zero drive to do it. It's weird. 

To be honest, I'm taking a break from college right now - I was very close to attempting suicide again - so I'm living at home now. But I feel embarrassed because a girl I used to be friends with in high school that I follow on instagram just graduated from oxford!! She's a year younger than me too, just 19, and already doing so much more than I ever could, even if I was motivated like her. It's so strange. I wish my brain worked like hers.

Anyway, I'm sorry for rambling. I really appreciate that you replied to my post. It's nice to not be the only one that feels like this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some background: I've struggled with depression since I was 10 and suicidal thoughts since I was 13. When I was 17, I think, I tried different meds and finally went on prozac, and that's been working well for me. I'm 20 now and I still very much struggle though.

I feel like my struggles with depression can be split into two halves. The first is the occasional kind, the really bad kind, that develops every few days or so, sometimes at random, where I feel absolutely terrible. I am consumed by self-hatred and my thoughts are at best passively-suicidal and at worst actively fantasizing and seriously considering it.

On other days, the in-between days, I am more "passively-depressed". This is a day like today. I can find enjoyment in things, kinda, but I feel horribly anxious about my future and everything around me. I worry and I feel overwhelmed and paranoid often. I feel like nothing matters. My nihilistic/anti-society thoughts come out stronger - stuff like "I just want to run away and live in a forest." "I hate how much we consume things." "I don't like this lifestyle - nothing is fulfilling. Everything is fleeting". It sounds kinda dumb when I write it out but it worries me because how can I ever be happy in the future if I don't even like society? I visited a factory the other day and it almost made me feel ill - I don't really know why. I recognize that this much sound silly, but I do mean it. I want to live in society. I want to be a part of things. But on my "good days", I worry so much about my future, "Will I ever really be happy?" type of thoughts, that it's depressing.

I dunno what to do. I feel so empty. On my bad days I wanna die, on my good days I feel that less but the result of me being able to think more clearly is that I dread my future.

What can I do? </TEXT>

<TITLE> My vision goes black for a bit if I stand up suddenly </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 20f here, 5'4' 108 lbs. I've noticed that for the past few years, if I get up from laying down and stand up quickly, my vision fades to black and I have trouble feeling "conscious". This develops and fades away all in the span of about 30 seconds. Details I've noticed: 

- doesn't usually happen when I first get up out of bed in the morning


- if I don't eat at all in the day, it becomes much, much more frequent and I feel kind of queasy throughout the day until I eat


- my mom also gets this occasionally when standing up quickly; my dad does not


- when I was younger, up until maybe about four years ago, I had no problems with this


This didn't bother me too much until I recently attempted a tiny fast where I didn't eat anything until dinner. Throughout the day, I felt more and more tired and literally any time I'd get up, even in a reclining or sitting position, the mini black out would happen. Is there any way I can avoid this? And what exactly is causing it? </TEXT>

So a little over a year ago, when I was 18, I posted pics on here and got good feedback. Y'all were super nice (especially considering how bad my makeup was at the time lol) and told me what to improve on and I tried to follow through with most of it. I grew my hair out, dyed it a bit, and watched makeup tutorials. Did I do alright? And what can I improve on?

I know they're not nancy drew games but they might as well be tbh, if only for the game engine and style of gameplay. It seems ridiculously camp and I love that lol. At this point I'm no longer loyal to her interactive as a company, especially with Penny at the helm, and I'm very willing to play a knock-off game if it means I get something even remotely similar to a nancy drew game. Have any of y'all ever played miss clue? What do you guys think of their games? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have recently gotten closer with a friend that I previously never hanged out with much. I have a class with her and I'm happy to have gotten closer to her, especially since most of my other friends are guys or tomboy girls. Obviously, there's nothing wrong with that, but it's nice to be able to talk about makeup and period cramps and romance movies sometimes. 


There's a small problem, however. I absolutely can't stand her boyfriend. They usually hang out together whenever she has free time, meaning I'd have to see him to see her. He just loves to hear the sound of his own voice. He tries to sound excessively confident in everything he says and it's so obnoxious. He's so smug. He makes little snide comment and remarks and godawful puns. To add to this, he's makes weird sexist jokes sometimes and was apparently a horrible lab partner to a friend of mine last year. Every time I see him, I completely avoid him or just leave because his voice is like nails on a chalkboard to me. I can count five separate people who have complained at one point or another about him, so it's not just me. I have never wanted to fight someone more.

<TITLE> I have some questions about applying to pharmacy schools in Canada </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-20 18:53:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Some background info: I'm a 19 year old girl and I go to the University of North Georgia in the US. I'm currently majoring in biology with a minor in Spanish, and I speak French fluently. I have dual citizenship with Canada and the US. I also have many relatives that live in Canada that I could potentially live with if need be.


So. I have questions about Canadian pharmacy schools vs American. The main reason I'm looking at Canadian schools is due to tuition prices. UGA's tuition is $29,000 in-state, while the University of Waterloo, for example, is only $2,400. That's a crazy difference. Is there a catch? Is there something I'm missing that would rank up the price for me? Even if I were to count as an international student, it says it would still be only $6000 for tuition.


In general, are there any major differences between the application process and the pharmacy schools themselves between the US and Canada? From what I've seen, the required courses and workload and so on seem more or less the same, just much cheaper than in the US. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Dealing with intense depression the week before my period </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-05 17:22:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Background: 19 years old/female/weight: 112 lbs/height: 5'4"


I have clinical depression and I take prozac, 20mg a day for it. For the most part, I'm stable. However, in the week before my period starts I almost always get extremely depressed. Self-hatred, thoughts of suicide, self-harm -everything I mostly don't think about because of my meds comes back in full force. The three times I've tried birth control, I got the same "symptoms" except they lasted for a month, because that's how long I managed to take the birth control. I stopped taking the birth control because at that point, it was interfering with my studies, plus it felt sort of dangerous to be considering suicide on a daily basis.


I would greatly appreciate 1) an explanation as to why my body/mind get like this seemingly due to hormones, and 2) any advice, suggestions, anecdotes about depression getting significantly
 worse when near the period and how to deal with it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [skin concerns] Is my current routine too exfoliating? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-30 15:01:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've never posted here before but I was wondering if you guys could give me some input regarding my daily/nightly routine.
Some background: Ever since I was a tiny child, I've had fairly noticeable sebaceous filaments. My parents thought they were blackheads, or some mysterious "refilling" pores, so from a young age I was squeezing them, using pore strips, and trying products with microbeads - basically everything I know not to do now. Most of them aren't too bad now that I've stopped messing with them directly.


By lurking on this sub and r/asianbeauty, I made some purchases and created a little routine for myself over the past few weeks. However, I've also read some horror stories about the dangers of overexfoliation, so I wanted to know what you guys think.


AM:

* wash with neutrogena pore refining exfoliating cleanser in the shower; leave on for a few minutes while I wash myself and then rinse it off at the end

* apply neutrogena moisturizer/sunscreen with spf 50

PM:

* wash makeup off with ponds cold cream

* wash again with neutrogena cleanser, but I don't leave it on my skin for a few minutes, I rinse it off after massaging it in a bit

* swipe maximum strength stridex over upper cheeks, chin, the part of my forehead near the area between my eyebrows, and especially my nose; let dry and then swipe another pad again and let dry 

* apply neutrogena deep moisture night cream, avoiding my eyes and the skin near them because it irritates them

Does this seem excessive? I've never had smoother, clearer skin prior to starting this routine. But I also don't really hear about people using a chemical exfoliant twice a day. What do you guys think? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a lot of work, a lot of tests and homework on my plate. It's only a few weeks into the semester, and the few grades I've gotten - on small papers and quizzes and such - haven't been great, even though I put effort into them. Do you guys have any advice or even personal anecdotes regarding dealing with a challenging courseload?


If it helps any, my classes are Biology 1107, Bio lab, Chemistry 1211, Chem lab, Public Speaking, and Mexican Culture. I know these classes don't seem very hard, and they probably aren't compared to some of the stuff y'all study, but unfortunately literally all of the professors I got are widely known to be hard graders, making situations and questions where I would get partial credit if I mess up be zero credit instead, which makes things a bit tougher.


In order of appearance, I've got an impromptu speech tomorrow, a short answer chemistry test over the first two chapters this Friday, over fifty questions of chemistry practice due Friday morning, a Spanish essay due Monday, a bio lab on Monday, a chemistry lab due next friday, two public speaking chapter summaries due over the next week, and a biology test over the first five chapters the Monday after next week.


Any support, links to helpful websites, personal anecdotes of your studying days, small statements of motivation is great - I'll take anything you guys :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like I'm an outlier here, but I really didn't mind being an only child. I was a pretty quiet kid. I loved reading and video games, and I usually kept to myself. I got both of my parents attention and love. Even though I was under a lot of pressure to do well in school, comparing me to the smart kid in class feels like it was much easier than being compared to a sibling, which my parents certainly would have done. </TEXT>

If it's a slower class where the professor uses powerpoint slides and discusses things, then either paper or typing is fine.

<TEXT> I'm a 19f sophomore who's heading home from college tomorrow for the first time since the semester started. I'm 5"4' and I was 106 pounds when I got here, and now I'm hovering between 112 and 114. This is the highest weight I've ever been in my life. 


I know exactly how it'll go. I'll tell my dad I'm more like 111 or 112 and how ashamed I am that I've gotten to this weight (and I am, but my butt and boobs also grew, soooo :T). At my dad's suggestion, I'll agree to eat as little as possible while I'm home. He'll make a couple jokes about how fat I am and how my thighs have no muscle and jiggle. How I might become "another fat american". Eventually, from drinking coffee and only eating oatmeal and probably browsing myproana, I'll get down to a nice 108 by the end of the week. I'll stop hating my thighs and I'll head back to school to study my ass off for finals and life will go on. </TEXT>

But then if you click on paperback, the book cover is completely different and it's much, much cheaper - $245 vs $49. I also definitely need the access code for this class and I'm confused if the paperback version comes with that. By comparison, our university bookstore sells the book for $324, so it would be great if I could get it for less than a fifth of the price. </TEXT>

I don't know a single person my age who actually likes either of our political candidates. There's terrorist attacks in foreign countries and police brutality in ours. There's no optimism, no clear good guys and bad guys. And this is just general stuff that's happening in the world today, I'm not even talking about personal problems we all have. Self-esteem issues, body image issues, etc. Why should we try to push through our problems and self-medicate with other crap when we can take a pill to help us through it? I take antidepressants and I can count over ten people I know easily that take them, not even including close friends. I'm not saying we take prozac to help us deal with politics, but when you've got your own issues with depression and the world seems like it's going to shit and every other friend's on prozac, you give in after a while. </TEXT>

<TEXT> French-Canadian-American. I love maple syrup, my entire family is from Qubec and we all speak slang-filled, "hillbilly" French at home. I apologize when someone bumps into me. Some of my favorite foods are tourtire, smoke-meat sandwiches, and maple cookies. My dad routinely complains about American culture. I don't think a single person in my family (immediate and extended) is religious, but almost everyone over the age of 40 was raised Catholic and left the church (and home) when they were teenagers. I also get really sad when I see people complaining on the internet about how Qubcois people are awful or rude :(. I guess some of us are jerks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Never-Ending Road by laventadorn. It's a Harry Potter fic that basically rewrites nearly the entire series where Harry's actually a girl and has a crush on Snape. It sounds ridiculous by the premise, but it's probably my favorite fic ever. It's really well-written and fleshed out, and manages to be heartwarming even when the situation's grim. Snape is also fantastically snarky.

I've been reading The Never-Ending Road for a while now and even if it's not really smutty at all, I can't exactly say to people, "Hey, I'm reading a fanfiction about an alternate version of Harry Potter where he's a girl and has a crush on Snape. You should totally read it." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it depends on the pajama pants tbh. If they can pass for regular sweatpants or joggers or something, they're alright. But if they look like genuine pajama pants, I'd leave them at home.
It also depends on the time of day. If it's early morning or late at night, I wouldn't really judge, but it's 4 in the afternoon it's a little weird. </TEXT>

About half my reasons for not going are dumb excuses (my hair looks bad, I'm sleepy, I didn't wake up early enough, etc.) and the other half are insecurities (my legs look bad and I'll get judged, I'll look lazy and unhealthy for only jogging on the treadmill compared to the other girls my age). It's ridiculous. I'm not even overweight, I'm on the lower end of the bmi for "normal", but I still look bad because I'm not toned. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I first started having sex, it was pretty terrible. I tried both in relationships and in open pseudo-relationships (fwb) and whatnot and it was uncomfortable in every way. Strangely, I was actually very sex-positive and my family was very much not religious, but I still hated sex the first few years. I would agree to it only because it was offered and I didn't want to seem lame and say no. The idea of sex was nice, but as soon as he or she would enter me it was terrible. At best, it was mildly uncomfortable and boring, even if they were eating me out, and at worst, with penetration, it was horribly painful and still very boring, no matter how attentive and sweet they were. Nothing felt good. I would go from being extremely wet to mentally planning out my schedule for the week within minutes. I've only been able to legitimately enjoy sex with my current boyfriend, and I think part of may have been this mental block I developed on it and the association of all the other unpleasant times I agreed to sex for the benefit of the other person.
Tl;dr Don't be like me and spend three years agreeing to sex even if you don't enjoy it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wasn't doing well last semester so I got an email saying I had to have a meeting with a counselor and get a physical evaluation. I did neither of those things during the semester and from talking to my RA director, it didn't seem mandatory anyway. Fast forward to early june - I get an email saying I now absolutely have to get those two appointments done by July 15th or else my fall classes will be canceled.

I got the counselor meeting done on Sunday in secret with the help of my boyfriend driving me (I live very far from campus), but now I have to go to a doctor to get a physical and bloodwork. I don't even have a current doctor, and I haven't been to one in years anyway. There's no means of doing this without my dad finding out cuz my parents'll get billed for it. It's absurdly stressful. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I'm worried about being a finance major </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-27 20:27:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I chose finance as my major largely because I didn't much like my other options. I genuinely love theology, art, psychology, and linguistics, but there's no real guaranteed, well-paying jobs in those fields. So what fields do offer those jobs? Medicine, mathematics, physics, engineering, IT, and finally, finance. I took classes in high school in each of those other fields and didn't really enjoy them except for economics and such, so I picked finance.
Now I've heard finance is a very difficult field to get a job in. I don't know how to make myself more valuable, I guess, for a company to want to hire me eventually.

I'm 19 and I'm curled up in my bed like a child. I'm not set to take any actual finance courses until after the coming semester. I'm worried for the future.

What can I do to help prepare myself for a career in finance? Are there any certificates I could get online this summer?

I thought about posting this in /r/finance but that sub seems to be mostly made up of news articles and such, not whiny questions from confused students.

<TEXT> Over the past few weeks, my depression got really bad and I was considering attempting suicide again.  A friend of mine told the RA Director I wasn't doing well, and the lady had a meeting with me the next day. It helped immensely. She was extremely kind without being patronizing like some counselors do (e.g. "you're such an inspiration!") and she filed an incidence report for me telling the counseling team and the dean of students about it. In the same two days or so, I talked more about it to some of my friends and my parents and they were really supportive. I feel so much better - like I'm not so afraid of failure any more. I feel loved. I've got this big support group now. I have a list of things to complete - seeing a counselor, doing old math homework, etc - and people who love me and encourage me as I do them.

<TEXT> I dunno if this is normal or not. I'm 19, away at college. My mom came down to have dinner with me cuz she had a business thing going on in a nearby town.
I don't really want to have dinner with her. I don't have anything I really want to talk about. I'd rather go hang out with my friends or work on homework. I don't want to force small talk - it'll just make her uncomfortable/feel unhappy because it's a reminder our relationship isn't close.

She's just an automaton. My dad wins the arguments with her at home cuz he shouts the loudest. Sometimes he makes her cry, though I guess I've done the same. She cries more easily though. She works all the time, long hours. He makes her feel insecure about her weight sometimes cuz his sisters are teeny tiny (they fit into children's clothes, no lie).

She lets herself get walked over. She never stands up for herself in arguments with him. If I fight with him, I stand up for myself! I fight back just as hard and just as loudly as he does, and sometimes I win. Even if I don't, at least I put up a fight. She doesn't. It's sad. It makes it hard to respect her.

I recognize that this isn't normal. The home dynamic is skewed. I guess my dad could be classified as emotionally abusive, or at least he was up till a few years ago.

I'm just frustrated. Sorry. I just wanted to get this out. I swear, I'm not spoiled - I've never directly told her this stuff. I'm respectful in person.

<TEXT> [Remorse]: If you feel bad 

He basically raised me. Almost all of my childhood memories involve him in some way cuz he stayed home while mom worked. He's been the main influence on me throughout my whole life so far. I'm not close to my mom.

I'm clinically depressed. I can point fingers and say he started it by pushing me at school to be smarter than I actually am, and berating me when I couldn't meet his standards. He's caring. He'd spend hours helping me memorize and study and review things. He's always tried explaining things like how the stock market works and how to fix a car, but I was never interested enough and couldn't pay attention, or I'd forget what I'd learned within days.

I'm never good enough for him man. Never ever. There's always something. My head's always in the clouds. I'm very spacey and clumsy. I'd study for hours to remember and do well on stuff other people could understand in just one. Even when I got high grades, 95s and 100s, they had to be higher, come on, why can't you do better, are you stupid or what?

Why do I fixate on this so much? Why does it bother me so much that I can't be the daughter he wants me to be? I'm 18. I'm supposed to be adult, he says. But I can't do it. I feel like I'm so defective. I don't think like an adult. I'm not observant and I'd rather live in my head or in a book or a movie than in real life.

Outwardly, I'm okay. I'm lean and fit. I have good hygiene, and I've been told I'm attractive. I guess I could be a housewife or something. Despite my parents' best efforts to make me independent and modern, I genuinely wouldn't mind it. I don't really enjoy sex, but I'm okay with going through it to make the other person happy. I could do that.

God, I'm sorry for writing all this out. This is terribly depressing. I tried killing myself a year ago but it didn't work. I only took 40 pills cuz I was scared I'd take too many and end up in that limbo where they can keep me alive but I'm brain damaged or a vegetable. Shit I'm supposed to hang out with someone today. But I feel bad cuz it means I'm gonna have to lie about it cuz my dad doesn't like that friend. I just wanna curl up in a hole.

Man I'm sorry about writing all this. I've talked about it on reddit before and now I just feel like I'm complaining. I'm not even good at replying to PMs cuz it feels like I'm actively complaining to a person. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To reduce greasiness, make sure you massage the shampoo throughout all of your hair as well as you can, and then rinse thoroughly.

Idk if there's any way to really make your hair thicker, but I've heard taking biotin and multivitamins can help, at least with the overall healthiness of it.

I've also heard dry shampoo - the kind that's in the aerosol can, like a hairspray - is helpful in adding volume and reducing grease, so you could try that too. </TEXT>

Electra heart was mostly all about female stereotypes and sex and society and all that, and I loved it at the time. But froot feels like a good departure from it all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All of this right here. And to make stuff easier OP, you don't have to work on all of these things at once. Pick one - say the hygiene thing - and then follow through with it for a full week. Then add to that, the week after, figure out what your bmi is and start counting calories a bit. Figure out your bmr and try not to eat much over that. Weigh yourself daily without clothing and chart your progress.

Start with the stuff that affects your physical appearance the most cuz that has the biggest effect on self-esteem. Then work your way on the other stuff. All the stuff that bugs you is 100% fixable, seriously. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't think of a specific thing that got a lot of outrage, but I remember seeing something I was really surprised people *weren't* up in arms about. About two or three years ago, there was this askreddit thread about rapists, asking why they had done it and if they regretted it. The top upvoted comments were literally people confessing that they had raped someone and how it happened, and most of the responding comments were reassuring and forgiving them. It was kinda surreal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not offended at all - it's a good question, and I used to ask myself that a lot. At this point, I recognize that I'm the same person on or off medication. The main thing that changes when I'm on it is the tone of my thought process and my ability to get myself out of those black hole/pit/spiral of negative feelings that can sneak up on me.

Without meds, I guess you could say I am 100% myself - but I don't like being that, because that version of me is crippled. It can't stand on its own, it can't defend itself - and it has no will to do so. I'd rather be this version of me, altered with prozac in my body and brain, than the half-dead version. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would say so, yes. I've been on medication for about two years now. About a month ago I concluded, with the support of my doctor, that I was happy and stable enough to stop taking it. I tried over the past month to get off of it but - I can't do it. The difference in my mental state over the course of a few weeks was ridiculous. I went from having a mostly positive attitude on life to wanting to overdose. It's scary, the massive difference. If you can get your hands on the right medication and at the right dosage, you can feel completely different. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been in a bad mood for the past month. Like just alternating between want to break things and wanting to overdose. I keep overanalyzing and hating a bunch of aspects of myself. It sucks.

Coincidentally, I started a new job a little over a month ago, I stopped taking prozac because at the time I was feeling pretty good and it's such a tiny dose, and I stopped doing regular exercise.

I can see that it's mostly these three things that are making me feel way worse than normal, but all I want to do is sleep. It's easy to sleep. My boss just left a voicemail to call him back and I'm pretty sure it's to get me to pick up a shift tomorrow. Or sign a paper, not sure which. Probably both. 

I just feel like shit :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel extremely jittery and kinda angry and I keep adjusting my clothes. I'm not totally sure what's going on? My face doesn't look like me, or it does I guess. Um. I can't tell if I'm calm or not right now. I just suddenly feel like this. I think it started while I was putting on makeup after my shower and I was looking at myself really closely and I started feeling weird. My clothes feel uncomfortable, they're both tight and loose and it's weird.

I don't really know what to do. Does anyone want to talk to me until this passes? I don't really know what 'this" is anyway. I'm just pacing around in my house. Maybe I'm just imagining this feeling and I'm actually ok, but I can't tell.

Ok I changed my clothes and I kinda feel better but it's still weird. On a side note, I need to grow out my hair. </TEXT>

I don't know if it's some kind of a coping strategy to deal with parts of your life you can't control, or if you're just unhappy and telling yourself you're an intellectual who doesn't need other people's approval to feel satisfaction. Whichever it is, it's fine. Really. Just understand that no one - really, no one - is impressed by you. And hey, if you're not looking to impress people, then what's your purpose in making these kinds of comments? Does it really make you happy to be such a killjoy? </TEXT>

For girls, basically the same characteristics :p. Though I've noticed I care less about facial shape with girls.

I don't care as much about how they look, but their attitude and personality is more important than for guys for some reason. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How did you get this far? I mean it, how did you get this far without your parents beating your stupid, spoiled ass like they should?

Outwardly, yes, we're very similar people - we went to the same middle school and high school, we're from the same white upper middle class area, and even our faces and voices are similar. But god, you're such a spoiled brat! Crying, complaining, moaning about something or other day in and day out. And it's funny cuz you expect me to listen. Do you remember how we became friends? Cuz you started ranting about gym class to me. I went along with it. I was small and gangly and unattractive - I didn't have anyone else to talk to, so I went along with it, as I have been for five years. Thing is, I don't really know why I still am? I grew into myself and I've got more confidence than I used to. I don't need you. The only reason I still text you back at all is cuz I'm still here for the next two months until I leave for college.


Do you know why your stupid self has been bullied since elementary school? It's cuz you have the emotional strength of a goddamn toothpick. Any form of criticism, jab, or minor prank, you react to like they personally insulted your mother. You snarl and roll your eyes. You might bang your fists on the table. You tearfully flee the scene to go cry in the bathroom. It's no wonder people target you - you're even weaker than I am. You need a therapist. Sometimes I think you should've gone to that hospital instead of me, but when I think about it, you would've just ranted about it as soon as you got out.

And another thing! Why the hell do you act like such an asshole to our mutual friend?! You complain about your life to a guy who literally had brain cancer and lives with his mom in an apartment that's less than half the size of your house. And he even listens to you! He's got so much more patience for you than I do, and yet you put him down because of your dumb fear of men and drinking and anything scarier than bible study. You're such a prick, and I hope I never talk to you again after I leave. </TEXT>

<TITLE> It's getting difficult to support my friend (warning, long post) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-02 17:22:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Some background info: I've been friends with this girl for the past five years. We graduated high school in May and she started college in August. I chose to take a semester off and am starting in January, so I have no real experience of college yet.

My friend is naturally a very emotional person. She feels things strongly and she expresses her feelings openly. This has led to situations of extreme anger (ex: slamming hands on the lunch table, biting out angry words like they do in movies) and extreme sadness (openly crying) in public places. 

Here's the main problem. She has been bullied since she was young. From what I've seen, she appears to attract bullies because she reacts very strongly to jibes, pranks, and criticism against her. When they see how she reacts, they try to rile her up further.

Additionally, she's fairly insecure and unsocial. She hates drinking and smoking, which is understandable, but she limits herself socially because of it. She refuses to go to any parties or bars because she doesn't want to interact with any "drunk perverts" or experience a place that's loud and full of people. She struggles with anxiety as well and is prone to panic attacks.

As of right now, she's had some bad experiences with one of her roommates, who seems to like antagonizing her and, like others have done, riling her up. Additionally, she's also had trouble with schoolwork and computer problems, adding to her stress.

I don't really know how to support her at this point? I'm doing my best to give her emotional support and I reassure her that her future will be better, it's just a rough patch, she can change roommates next semester, etc. But it's kinda hard not to feel frustrated with her. Every time me or a mutual friend give advice, she automatically refutes it by some excuse or other. She's taking classes right now that I've always had an interest in but could never pursue because of family pressure. And she complains about them - assignments I would genuinely love to work on. Her experiences with anxiety and sadness mirror my experiences with depression and anxiety a few years back. Weirdly, I feel less sympathy for her because of this - I learned a lot and I pushed through it largely on my own and with tough love from my family. I'm jealous that her parents are easy on her, I'm jealous of the fact that she's never experienced the "tough love" that I did. I feel awful for feeling like this, but I don't know how to change my way of thinking.

I'm kinda at my wit's end here. I love her, but she's feeling miserable and I can't help but frustrated when we talk. Has anyone been in a situation like this? Or alternatively been in her shoes?

I just read over this and I'm sorry if I come off as whiney in this post :( I'm frustrated and sad that she's sad. I know this is a tiny struggle compared to what other women on here face, but I would appreciate advice all the same.

TL;DR: Friend is having life struggles that I'm finding it increasingly difficult to support her through them because I feel she's not dealing with them effectively or in the way that I would. Need advice on what I should do.

I can't see anything but my phone screen. So I'm going along, not rubbing too much or anything, just getting myself relaxed when I suddenly hear a door close. I look up. The door connecting my room to the bathroom is wide open. The one connecting the bathroom to the hall, which directly opens right into my parents room, is shut. I never close one without closing the other. 

THIS MEANS THEY HEARD ME. They heard and were like oh god gross kid lets close your door.

<TEXT> I have strong opinions, but they're not really enforced. I can absolutely love a trend or a belief and then read an article bashing it and my feelings towards it'll completely change.

I feel like I'm a side character in a main character's story. My appearance was determined by an online trait generator. My back's 20 degrees crooked and I wear the same pair of boots every day because they make me feel tough. My face is both soft and angled - I'm pretty and ugly all at once. A mishmash of my father's nose and chin, my mother's cheeks and skin. I have a Tragic Backstory and I was a Troubled Youth for a while. I have daddy issues and I can't speak my mother tongue as well as I'd like. I'm even a Relatable Teen Character because I can't do liquid eyeliner and I love eating pizza and watching scary movies. Everything's just a trope. I can't tell if it's comforting or nauseating.

Nothing feels like it really matters. Nothing has any weight. It's just a story.

<TEXT> Thanks very much for the info. Even if it's not super recent, it's still helpful :p. Part of the reason why I'm considering joining the corps is because I usually work better under discipline and a tight schedule than without.

- How come do you think there were so few women that went through all four years? Like, was it a lack of interest, or difficulties, or a bad environment? 

- From the university's website, it says you get a $300 monthly stipend and a majority of tuition covered, so the monetary benefits seem to have changed since you went (but anyone please correct me if that's wrong). So I guess that's half of my motivation to join, especially with all the news about how awful student debt is these days.

- Also, about what the other guy's saying, would you say that military work (formations etc) was greatly prioritized over academics? And if so, did it affect you in any way? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm headed there in the spring but was wondering what y'all thought of it. Additionally, I've been thinking about whether or not I should join the corps of cadets because it seems like they'd pay for a lot more of my tuition. Any advice or anecdotes regarding the university or its corps of cadets would be much appreciated.


Edit: Also, I dunno if this is of much relevance, but I'm a girl, and the website says only 10% of the corps is female. Would you say the dropout rate for girls is equal to that of the guys? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get what you're saying. I don't regret having been raised by him. All the way up till the first two or three years of high school, my grades were excellent because of his ambition for me. I appreciate how much he cared for my grades. On the other hand, I'm left with a lot of self esteem issues that stem mostly from failed attempts to gain his approval and make him be genuinely proud of me. And this carries on to today, where I struggle with wanting to be *good enough* - whatever that means - so that he'll be proud of me, and not just in a "oh, in spite of all this depression stuff, you've done okay" pitying type of way, but in a real way.

So it's kinda complicated :/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Disclaimer: I'm half-asleep right now and this is a little difficult to write about, so bear with me here :p

He wasn't a good parent for those years of my life. At his worst, he was emotionally abusive and controlling. At his best, he was just as caring and loving at any other parent. He was basically a "tiger mom", despite being a male French-Canadian immigrant.

I can't and won't try to defend him for how treated me when I was younger because he really did take it too far. Worrying that your dad's gonna do the head-fist-thing or scream so loud he starts shaking and making grabby motions with his hands like you're gonna get hit again because you just don't understand fractions isn't fun, and it didn't help me understand math any better.

Thing is, over the past 3 years, he's gotten better. I can't remember the last time where he got as angry as he did when I was little. We've talked and talked for hours about how he made me feel when I was younger. He's apologized multiple times since then. He tells me he loves me as often as he can.

He's a flawed man, but he's a good man who had good intentions. He wanted me to grow up better. His own father also drove him to the point of suicide. He was emotionally neglected throughout most of his young life, and sought to rectify that with me, and so I was smothered with attention, love, and control in his desire that I be the best. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll probably grow my hair out into a bob over the next couple months, based on all the comments about it :p

Could you give me an example pic of someone wearing eyeliner not in the inner corners? I've tried it before but both of my parents said it made my eyes look strange, but maybe I was doing it wrong.

Hey guys. I've always been pretty insecure about my face, especially my chin, and I was wondering if I could get some honest opinions on how I look. The first album is basically me on "good hair days" and the second albums highlights my weird chin/jaw and a bad hair day.
I'd sincerely appreciate any feedback or constructive criticism!

Edit: Thank you for all the sweet compliments and constructive feedback everyone 3 Based on what you guys have said (along with irl friends too), I think I'll grow my hair out into a bob and look into eye makeup/etc. </TEXT>

I've had my hair short like this for about a year now, but it never seems to look right. I usually put it so that it looks like the first picture. It's also pretty thick, grows relatively fast, and is naturally curly. Prior to cutting it, my hair was to my shoulders and looked awful tbh - I basically looked like a surfer dude despite being a girl.

Any tips or recommendations on styling it or getting a new hairstyle would be appreciated! :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some background info: I'm female, 18 years old, 5'4, and weigh 110 lbs. I used to be super underweight when I was a kid but I got to a normal weight and appetite by the time I was 13 or so. 

Now, here's the problem. In the past year, my appetite's gotten a lot larger. I can eat less if I make myself, but I can easily eat large portions without feeling sick. Yesterday, I ended up outeating my dad at dinner - we had giant plates of noodles and vegetables and he couldn't finish his but I could and felt fine. Today at lunch, I ate two big bowls of rice and had to pull myself away from the kitchen because I still feel like I wasn't satisfied. My dad's started warning me I'm gonna get fat if I keep eating like this, and I'm getting worried too. Anyone else ever dealt with this situation? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Girl who was kinda my friend for a couple years started getting a crush on me about a year ago. In the months since, she's slapped my butt, awkwardly given me a massage outta nowhere (worst massage ever btw), talks to me by leaning reaaaally close to my face, and called out in the hall, "Hey subject4538! I like that skirt! *and what's under it.*"

Beautiful game series with an amazing storyline. The graphics aren't great now but they were the future to me when I was little. The amount of work put in to all the little details and dialogues, every automaton and edifice - everything is unique. I loved them and hope the third game comes out soon. </TEXT>

I guess most likely I'll have to move out of state. I'm a bit confused though. Dental hygiene as a field has been recommended to me by my counselor, a teacher, and what feels like a billion of those "best jobs with associates/bachelors degrees" lists. Yet anytime I read about it online in forums, I see tons of people bashing it.

Is it simply a bad job? Are there any states that pay them decently and don't deny benefits? Or should I just look for a different job? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alright, in the past couple years I've been seeing a lot of [these](http://www.tomboyfemme.com/image/110844588804) kinds of shirts, but I have no idea how/where to buy them! Specifically the button down, short sleeve, rolled up, slim fit style I seem to see on so many cute girls but never in stores. I'm kinda small (110, 5'4) especially when compared to most guys, but it seems like the style of the shirt is made for males? So I was thinking probably have to buy xs or xxs, but again, I don't know that many retailers that sell clothes ~for men~ but small enough to fit me.

Anybody have any tips on where to buy these shirts? Or if you happen to own one, where'd you buy it? :p </TEXT>

<TITLE> What can you do with an associate's degree in business administration from a local community college? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's one of the more affordable options in my life right now. I'm a 17 year old girl, a senior in high school. I'd like to find some kind of a job in finance, but I'm not sure what kinds of jobs I could honestly get with just an associate's from a community college. Everyone else is going to big state colleges to get bachelor's degrees, but it's so expensive. I've struggled with depression as well and I don't want to put myself in a situation where I could put myself in debt and add more financial strain to myself and my parents' lives. Does anyone have advice for me? Or if you know of  a sub that would be better-suited for this kind of post, that'd be cool too.

Edit: Another option is becoming a nurse. The college is accredited and offers an associates in nursing, so that's something. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 17, not too sure yet. Thinking about going to a local community college for two years to study finance. This summer I'm gonna try to take an online course and pass an exam to become a registered mortgage broker. It'd be nice to have that under my belt. I'm not really sure how get started as a mortgage broker though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Freshman and sophomore year of high school was filled with busy work. So much grammar, readings, analyses, essays, and worksheets for each class. 3 to 4 hours a night was normal. Junior year, you were finally allowed to take real AP classes (other than AP Government and AP World History), so the intense kids would take 4 to 5 APs while normal kids would take 1 or 2. At that point, homework was minimal - most of your time was spent studying for upcoming tests. Senior year is chill right now - minimal homework and tests. I rarely get homework, and when I do it can usually be done within an hour. The teachers know we're burnt out so they don't assign us much. It's relaxing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember seeing a year or two ago on reddit a series of vividly bright paintings. The two I remember the best were a scene of a park in the spring - the leaves and the light filtering through the trees was so bright and green - and a scene of trees along a path in autumn. In the comments a couple people discussed how the painter was believed to have synesthesia, or possibly extra rods or cones in his eyes that allowed him to see "hidden" colors. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I messed up with my dad. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-25 14:25:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been ignoring my AP Spanish online class for a while, and my grade slipped because I've barely turned anything in. It was at an 81 for a while but now it's a 54 because the teacher (rightfully) put in lots of zeros. If I actually buckle down and work, I can bring it up to a 70 and it'll be okay, but that's not the part that scares me. They sent an email to my dad saying my grade was below a 75 and that I haven't logged on since 15 days ago. I've been lying to him about that. I said my work was on time and that everything was okay because that's easier. It's not even that I don't understand the class - I just feel so unmotivated and I didn't understand the directions for a lot of the projects, so I didn't do them. I sent the teacher several emails for clarification, but she never replied.


I messed up. All the trust and good feelings I've had with my dad are gonna be gone. We went so long without arguing. He's gonna say how I don't love him and how I'm so selfish, and I'l take it. He talks about dying sometimes. He jokes sometimes that we'll have to cremate him in the oven because he doesn't want us to spend money on him. He wants to die in ten years and I say I'm okay with it but I'm really not, which is also selfish. My grandma's dying so mom is stressed too, and he'll say I don't love her either, which is kinda true, but that's neither here nor there.  </TEXT>

It feels like the name's been taken over by people who think women are better than men, or fat women are better than skinny, and etc, when that's not the case at all. I don't want to associate myself with a group like that. I want women to be able to drive cars and vote everywhere, and men to be able to file a rape claim and not be laughed at or ignored. That's what real feminism is - complete equality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the past couple years, I've become very interested in scarification and branding. I like the idea of being able to put a mark on myself - basically a self-made scar or reminder, something no one else can do, and much cheaper than getting a tattoo. Therefore, I've concluded that using a bovie cauterizing pen would be my best bet. It's safe, sterile, and used by doctors to seal wounds. I'd sincerely appreciate it if someone could buy me one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was a girl scout from 2004 to 2008 in Dallas, Texas. It was kinda shitty. The troop leaders, two church ladies, would bring up a couple of ideas - spa day, ride horses on a ranch, make doggy care bags, for example - and we'd vote on which one we'd plan to do. We never went to a museum or learned any survival skills. Once I left, I realized that it was actually the boy scouts that got to do all the cool stuff - archery, fishing, camping for weeks on end in the summer. I wish I could've been in the boy scouts.


Oh yeah. The cookie money? I remember the one year we all made an effort for it, we spent 50 bucks on getting a kid in africa a goat or something, and the remaining 350 dollars we had we spent on an overnight stay at great wolf lodge.


I don't buy girl scout cookies anymore. I'm honestly kinda ashamed of having been a part of that, and the cookies were never that good to me anyway. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, of course. Why should people have to keep suffering just because others want them to live? My grandma's got terrible dementia, bowel problems, and is becoming less and less like herself every day. A few weeks ago, in a brief moment of clarity, she asked my mom's brother to help her die. That's what she wants more than anything right now. Her husband and children have to see her suffer every day, but no one's allowed to help her die because they'd be arrested. It's horrible. I just want her to die peacefully, with as little pain as possible, and that way is assisted suicide. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How come you're getting F's? Do you not understand the material, are you not interested in working, or are you lazy? Figure out what your problem is and then change yourself for the better.


When I don't feel like working hard or studying something (I'm a senior btw, this happens too often), I sit myself down with the work I gotta do, put my laptop and phone out of reach, and make a checklist of every worksheet or essay I gotta do by the end of the day. Then, organize the first thing on that list in front of you and work on it until it's done. Then move on to the next one. It's probably the only way I can get my ass in gear and tell myself "Okay. Do you wanna be a hobo when you grow up? Do you wanna work at a gas station? No? Then work your ass off and graduate so you can do whatever after high school." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Community college and then moving on to getting a real major sounds like a good plan and a lot more affordable. I'll talk to my parents about it tonight. I'll remember to go to the career center too once I get there. As for the depression stuff, that's a huge relief. I have no intention of mentioning it in applications or resumes or anything. Thank you for all the info :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe I could go to GA Southern or a local community college for the first two years and then transfer to a different college. I'll do more research on it.

<TEXT> I'm a 17 year old senior in high school in Georgia. I plan on majoring in finance and I'm considering applying to GA southern because it's only about $3500 a semester for tuition, but my mom claims it's a bad idea because good companies only give kids from good universities a chance. Is this true? Can I have a good future (or at least a life above the poverty level with a job in finance) even if I go to a cheap college?


Some background and other things that kinda worry me: I've had some trouble with depression and was hospitalized as an outpatient for a period of two weeks last year. Will colleges (ga southern or any others I apply to) be less willing to admit me because of this?


I'm afraid I really just don't know much about this and I've gotten many very different responses from school counselors and other adults, so I'd appreciate it if I could get some advice on this. The last thing I want is to graduate with debt and little job prospects. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Man can and and do suffer from stereotypes and poor treatment, just as women can and do. Thing is, - and note, this happens at a greater frequency in third-world countries or people raised in a similar culture - women are generally viewed as second-class citizens. Women, as shown by surveys and studies, have less access to education and have more of a chance of being sexually abused than men in the world.

Am I saying men don't get abused? That female abusers don't exist? God no. Men can be very much abused and it's a horrible, horrible thing. The only point I'm trying to explain is that as a whole, globally, women are not treated as equal to men in many places, and this results in them having a higher chance of treated badly. That's why feminism is important - women and men need to be treated equally. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Throughout my years digging in the trenches, I've fought many battles, but none so horrendous and heart-breaking as the Battle of the Skeleton-Man. Half man, half skeleton, he was a fearsome beast as tall as ten of my men and almost as wide as my mother. He came lumbering at us from across the hills in the east, his eyes glowing red in the night like a daemon of the old days. We gripped our swords and charged toward him, letting out our mighty battle-cry, but due to his height, we could only land blows to his feet like ants. My skele-bro in arms attempted to launch his sword into the beast's eye, but he was no match for the brute, and with a mighty smash, his bones were soon scattered around the battlefield. His skull landed near my feet. In agony, I fell to the ground and cradled his skull in my arms. "Oh skele-bro," I whispered, "Why didn't you drink your milk?!" </TEXT>

I tried to kill myself last Wednesday. It scared him a lot and I felt awful. But then other times he reminds me that I'm so selfish and awful, and how I can never give back. They spent so much money on me - hospital and antidepressants and therapy. It stressed my mom out a lot too. he's reminded me that it all depends on me and what I do in life, but just feels like I'm such a burden on them, I don't know what to do :(  </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be honest, she really just wouldn't take it well at all... I tell my dad because he went through it when he was a teenager and has struggled with depression. He made an attempt on his life as well when he was young and so is familiar with how it feels, while my mom is not, so he's more understanding. There's also the fact that my mom goes on lots of trips where she's in another country, and in the past when she knew I wasn't doing well, it really stressed her out, and she's already stressed by work in general. She's gone from 7 in the morning to 7 at night, and then from home she sometimes works until 10. Overall, we must don't want to put more stress on her than she's already got. She's said in the past that she wishes we would tell her about these kinds of things but for the sake of her health, we don't.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> I tried to kill myself Wednesday. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-14 18:01:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Remorse] I took something like 30 tablets of tromadol and promethazine before I went to bed because I didn't want to be a burden on my parents or anyone anymore. My stomach started hurting and my breathing got slow and little but I was worried that if it didn't kill me I'd get brain damage so I focused on taking deep breaths until I fell asleep. I hoped it was gonna kill me then or at least give me a seizure to punish me for it but it didn't.


I woke up feeling very weird. I had a hard time walking and I had to focus really hard to think and breathe. I managed to take a shower but realized I couldn't go to school like that so I told my dad what I did and be flipped out. I don't remember much that day. He said I didn't have to go to school (I couldn't exactly function) and after yelling some more about how I could do this just because of ap spanish (he thought it was because of that but i tried to explain it was because i didn't want to be a burden, but it was hard to talk and think). He helped me get upstairs and drink more water and go to bed. I couldn't think and I was dreaming while I was awake sometimes. My tongue and jaw muscles kept doing this weird twitchy thing and I giggled at it. I tried to go to school the day after but I eventually realized I couldnt think well. My hands and body were jittery and I couldnt remember where my 4th period was. I got something like a 30 on a test and then just went to the nurse and said I threw up, so she let dad pick me up.


We didn't tell mom anything. It would kill her if she found out. She'd be so worried.


I still want to die today. I feel so stupid for still wanting to. He said killing myself would punish him and mom, that it was impossibly cruel and selfish and how could I do that?

I went to a hospital last year for it. I had to make my parents spend lots of money on that and courses I had to retake. Thousands of dollars. He had to drive 5 hours there and back to take me there and pick me up. It was horrible. I changed meds and that helped and I felt good in the summer, but now I'm here writing this. I went to a therapist for a while too and I stopped because I thought I was better.

It's been two years of feeling like this and I'm sorry. I'm just sorry. I need to get myself together. I don't want to be a burden to my dad but it feels like I am like this. </TEXT>

Then, when you wake up, try to think rationally and focus on moving your limbs and remembering shit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I live in Alpharetta, GA. The people at school that are okay with lgbt people don't really say anything/care, and the people that aren't okay with it tend to be a bit rude. Usually not mean stuff, more stuff like "Idgaf about gays, I just dont want them to get married." And "God, I hate San Francisco. Filled with gays, it makes me uncomfortable."


So basically, not super tolerant but not mean either.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah sorry, I just mentioned it in trying to be funny and reference the character of Sniper in Team Fortress 2 because that's one of his main lines. Your dad seems like an interesting man. 


My dad kinda said similar stuff, too. When I was very little, he stare out the window sometimes and say in English, "And now, it is time for me to die..." with his arms outstretched. Or he'd look out the window at random times and say, "Ah, Cecile, aidez moi." (cecile was the name of his mother and he was asking her for help). After a few minutes, he'd go back to work. I never understood it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really, really appreciate everything you've said and I actually read it about three times throughout the day to help myself keep going. Thank you :). Like you, I think it was easier to stay positive and not let myself get dragged down when I did exercise more often -I'll need to get back to that again. I guess it's just hard to remember that part about everything -including emotions- being temporary because it's like it swirls up around you and you can't see anything else but depression. I'll try my best to keep going though and I'll keep everything you said in mind. Today was pretty rough, but your comment really helped. Thank you :). </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, it honestly means a lot that you're asking this -thanks man. I meant to phrase it more like it was an accident, but yeah, self-harm's been a problem for a while now. I'm on anti-depressants and I've been doing that kind of shit -cuts and burns - less and less frequently, but I had a bad day and took it out on myself. By the end of this year, I have a goal to be mentally stronger so that I won't consider self-harm anymore. I can do it :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I got burned on my ankle about two weeks ago and it still hasn't healed. When it was first burned, it grew red and then a blister formed over the two areas pretty quick, but due to rough work they got popped at least twice and have led to pretty thick scabs over it now. Its pretty itchy and red right now. Does it look abnormal though or should it clear up soon? http://imgur.com/AIqWwaP </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jesus I just feel so dumb. I always disappoint my parents. I'm always discouraging. I know its only little things but those little things add up every time. Bad grades, arguments, lying, cutting - I can't do anything right. I feel so alone, even though I'm not. Thing is, most of the time these days i'm happy. I don't mope around or wallow in self-pity like i used to. That's pathetic and im over it. I got depressed a couple years ago, it got worse, i went to a hospital,got meds etc, its all good except its not and i just want to go away. I sound like a child, jesus. All the more reason to go. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In 8th grade, I got in an argument with this girl about science. Thing is, it wasn't like "ooh god made everything", it was waaay worse. This girl said she straight up *didn't believe in science*. I stared at her for a bit looking real confused and asked her what she meant, and she said in a lovely southern drawl "I just don't believe in science. It's simple. I don't think there's atoms or any of that. The Earth wasn't created by the Big Bang, it was by God, and anyone who believes that is stupid". Cue me and a friend trying to persuade her that you couldn't just not believe in science for like half an hour.

That shit was stupid. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was at my worst stage of depression - actively suicidal, apathetic to the world, and detached from how other people felt towards me - I felt it was so, so very selfish of my parents to try to keep me living. To tell me that *I* was selfish for considering suicide was insulting. My entire mindset of the time was the product of a deep depression, where I was turning my thoughts inward so much that I became self-absorbed and unable - not unwanting - to care about how others would feel if I were to die. Yet, now, I've a lot more stable from therapy, meds, and exercise, and I mostly disagree with what I used to think. I guess what I'm trying to say is that the desire to commit suicide  can overpower your normal idea of morals and rational thought.


**TL;DR** Depression sucks. Suicide, even if you mull it over for a long time, is a decision by an unhealthy mind and isn't rational in the end. :( </TEXT>
