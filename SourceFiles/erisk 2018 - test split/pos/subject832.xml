<TEXT> Nah man I'm totally with you here. It felt like there were too many 'AS IFFFFFF' moments. 

One that sticks out is them telling Cooper about the mission, all end-of-the-world-and-you-are-the-only-one-who-can-save-us usual fairly unrealistic movie trope...but the instead of simply cutting to the reveal of the spaceship..the entire boardroom wall slides away to reveal the entire fucking spaceship room. Who would design something like that? Why? What boardroom really needs a "dramatic effect" wall?

Also the bit where there's no science, simply a fucking whiteboard that cooper scribbles on to plan an entire landing mission on a planet. It's just too dumb. How hard would it have been to include some semi serious plans/orbits/trajectories or something. I only gave a kerbal space program level of space travel knowledge..but even jeb doesn't use whiteboards to plan missions!!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Late to the party.

I was playing one of those social board games, where you shout clues and shit to each other.

As far as I can remember it had cards with stuff on like 'lives in the sea' and you'd have to say a bunch of stuff like 'shark' and whatever until someone figured out what was on your card. 

My card was 'evil' or something like that. After all of the obvious things like, murder and kidnap and stuff, with my family guessing 'crimes, I had a sudden image in my 15 year old mind of the embodiment of evil; being obsessed with lord of the rings, what could be more evil than the cloaked, black ring wraiths? On the same note- dementors! Scream from Scary Movie! They're all hooded, cloaked in black.

So to generalise, I just said "Black people," to the absolute dismay and outrage of my conservatively minded mother, father and sister, now convinced they'd raised a closet racist.

Not my finest moment  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Just started citalopram. Questions about work? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-11 09:12:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I started a new temporary job (4 week contract) on Friday. I decided to start my citalopram on Friday afternoon. The side effects I feel are fairly minimal compared to what I was expecting/what other people suffer from, but the nausea and the feeling spaced out and tired is a bit of a struggle. I am still in training and I am worried I won't be able to handle it. I also have an interview tomorrow for a full time position.

I think I may have bitten off more than I can chew. I need time off sick but I can't take that from a temp contract that is only 4 weeks I have to power through. Trouble is its a job involving customer care and answering phone calls but talking makes me feel sick and I can't understand people over the phone very well right now. 

Any tips? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to work in a supermarket and there was a man who dressed just the way you described.

Only he had a handbag and nail polish and hair bands and the whole lot...but he still had a good inch of beard on him. The girl who was serving them had an issue with the purchase and she said to our supervisor 'can you help me with this man's items' clearly not thinking to say 'this customer' instead and the customer threw a fit about how they were a woman, not a man. It's always made me feel uncomfortable since.

 Perhaps it's the not knowing how to refer to them and walking on eggshells?

I still believe people should be able to wear what they want as long as it isn't hurting anyone else but I can't get past the feeling that people should wear the clothing assigned to their gender. Even writing that out feels wrong. Why does it even matter, really?

<TITLE> Please help me with my insecurity </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-29 02:35:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Once I was a young, stupid teenage girl and I fell for a 32 year old. I have always been an all or nothing kind of girl, so when I fell for him hard I just assumed he felt the same way. When I found out I didn't even know his name- his job, where he lived; ANYTHING about him, I was crushed. Not only was my trust in him destroyed, but I have later come to learn that my trust in men in general has been abolished.

Nearly 4 years later I have been in relationship with another man but t has been tainted throughout with my insecurity, my jealousy and my failure to trust him through no fault of his own. These traits pushed him away from me until he was unfaithful to me last year, further crushing my trust in men and removing my self esteem entirely.

A few weeks ago I acknowledged my anxiety issues and resolved to try and fix them: since then my SO has been away on business and whilst he was away told me he was afraid he had committed too young (we are both 23) and didn't want to miss the wild parts of his life. He also doesn't want to break up. I am convinced that he doesn't take this relationship seriously, and when I googled it, from a man's perspective I seem to check 8/10 boxes for reasons to break up with your girlfriend and I am so upset.

It's true I am jealous and insecure. I am nervous and feel unworthy of a partner like mine. But I never chose these feelings they were given to me. I don't know how to make them go away. Him cheating on me really didn't help.

I have possibly fucked up the most amazing thing to have ever happened to me in having my SO love me (once) and I don't know what to do.

Is there anyone with any experience here who can tell me their thoughts? How can I fight back the insecurity? How can I make him feel less drained by my awful behaviour? Please help. :(

Also if you're going to tell me to break up with him please don't. I've thought about it plenty and I am ready should that be the option I have to take- but it is my last resort. I want to fix this, not toss it away.

Thank you for your time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hope for your sake you only did one year before dropping out. God only knows how much debt I'm in, and I went to university BEFORE the fees went up. Also when I was at uni I had no idea the real costs of living. University is a pretty sheltered existence with no bills in my experience. It was a bit of a shock to the system when I came out and was taking almost nothing away from my paycheck each month. Granted that was a bad wage though.

Good luck with it man. You will need luck and a lot more to make this work for you.  </TEXT>

Can you not have a sit down chat about this with him, to explain why you have two brushes? Maybe he doesn't understand. Maybe discuss some alternative products for men designed for this; I saw another poster wrote about a couple.

You may be at risk of getting eye infections if you use this shared brush over your eyes. Maybe get another one and keep it secret. Only if talking to him doesn't work though; you shouldn't have to hide things from your SO. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll get the boring stuff out of the way first!!

I'm looking for someone who wants to make a close and trustworthy friend, but is not going to panic if we don't talk for a few days or weeks at a time. Sort of like an online pen-pal. Longer messages rather than IMs, it's more exciting that way. Who doesn't like to get a long(ish) message just for them? :)

I'm based in Yorkshire, if you're local then that's cool but I'm not intending with meeting anyone on here until we've messaged for a few weeks/months/until we're both comfortable with that.

A few things about me:

* My biggest hobby is gaming online. TF2 is my favourite!

* I also enjoy reading, movies and listening to music.

* I am in a relationship, so platonic friendship only please.

* I am friendly and I like to make other people happy

* At times I can suffer from poor self-confidence. I'd like to know that anyone I make friends with on here is okay with me talking about my problems occasionally. I am happy to help you with yours too :)

* I'd ideally like to make friends with people age 20+ but don't let this put you off, PM me if you'd like to chat regardless of your age.

Hopefully this won't put too many of you off haha.

Hope to hear from you soon :)

<TEXT> You have to take things slowly with people. Saying something that would require a 'filter' in normal situations should maybe wait until later, don't go in full guns blazing waving your 'if you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best' flag because that will put off so many people. You won't make a good impression by showing them your worst straight away.

If you at least acknowledged that it was a shitty thing to say then at least you're getting somewhere and learning things..you're right that you shouldn't have to change for them, but at the same time you shouldn't expect THEM to change for YOU, i.e. forced acceptance of your offensive humour. Just try and start small with any jokes you might have and build them up rather than jumping in with everything you have. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-03-23 16:43:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The trouble with applying through websites like cv-library.co.uk  is that so many of them are done through agencies that provide no information on their location, and as someone who has to rely on public transport this is an issue for me. Some roles I apply for may not be attainable for me at all.

This is the issue with the job interview I have tomorrow. It's a role that I'm not particularly keen on, however I need to have a job before I can start working on my primary career target. I need to get 2 buses, or a bus and a tram to get to this place, and I'm really worried I'll be late often because of the transport issue. That and I'm not sure I want that job.

The agency that has put me forward is also putting me forward for a different job which I'm really, really keen on. Should I hold out on job #1 in case I do get an interview at job #2? i'm worried that my consultant will think me unreliable or a risk-taker if I turn down job #1 for the mere chance of job #2.

Should I just snap up the first opportunity I'm given? I've only been searching for about 4 weeks.

Sorry for the garble. I'm just letting the brain waves flow out onto the page :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Absolute beginner to scooters, looking for some advice! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-23 12:39:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys! For reference, I'm based in the UK.

I am looking to get a scooter as an inexpensive form of travel for commuting to prospective jobs. Most of my questions involve some aspect of money as I don't have a job right now and I don't want to run out of rent money! I have a few total noob questions and I'm also looking for open-ended advice, perhaps something you wish you knew when you started out scootering.

1) Is it a good idea to purchase the scooter before taking the CBT test? I feel a little unsure about learning on a different scooter to the one I will eventually have- or are they pretty similar in terms of mechanics?

2) Would you buy new or second-hand? I am drawn to the low prices on gumtree, but knowing next to nothing about scooters I'm a little cautious about buying from there in case I get lumped with something terrible/has lots of problems. I really love Vespas but perhaps I should wait a couple of years before getting one of those!

3) How do you recommend storing a scooter? I have a back yard, but where I live is incredibly hilly and I wouldn't be able to get it in the shed at the back of the yard. Is keeping it under a cover acceptable?

4) How much should I spend on gear? (jackets helmets etc.) I'm not willing to skimp on safety but I want to know what's a good price so I'm not going to get ripped off.

5) Is there any other advice you'd like to give me? Really anything is helpful. Please feel free to rip to shreds anything I've said above if you disagree with it, I want to know your thoughts!

Thank you so much for your time. :)

edited to add another: what kind of scooter would you recommend for an absolute beginner? I'm not looking above 50cc.

<TITLE> [HELP] When researching what dogs might fit my lifestyle, I came across the Basenji. Can anyone offer advice where to find one in the UK? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-21 15:14:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've never owned a dog and this is prospective searching for in the future, probably 1-2 years away from now when my partner and I have our own house. Where we live now will not accept dogs.

I had my heart set on italian greyhounds for years, but having done some more research on the Basenji I may have changed my mind. 

Would this dog be recommended for a first time dog-owner? Where in the UK might I find a Basenji? I've looked into getting italian greyhounds from reputable breeders before, and from my research it seems like they almost never sell to first-time dog owners. I'm assuming this breed will be the same since they're very uncommon. Am I hoping for the impossible?

Some thoughts on this from the experts would be lovely :)

Thank you for your time! </TEXT>
