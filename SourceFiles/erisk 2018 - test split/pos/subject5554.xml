<TEXT> It's a tricky subject of course, but I think there's a way to do it tastefully. Perhaps you see the cameraman and crew enter the house, calling out for Joanie and see just an arm or a leg of hers on the couch or something and fade to a black titlecard that says "Joanie was found in her home unresponsive."

I'm not saying you linger on a shot of her dead body, but the sad discovery of finding someone you loved tragically OD'd is kind of what the movie is about no? It's the worst case scenario for any downward spiral story.

Now that I actually watched the trailer it looks like they may have handled it very similarly to how I described. To scrap the movie entirely would be a disservice.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only one that is ridiculous is Goldberg's return, and as a listener of his show he never actually claimed WWE did it to spite him, he just speculated that maybe that was a factor in the timing (since Goldberg was never discussed to come back during the time he was there). But even as a fan of his I thought that conspiracy theory was dumb as fuck.

But the rest of the claims are totally feasible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's worth noting that there are very few wrestlers over 400 lbs. And most male athletes in good shape, especially those over 6ft, can easily squat and deadlift 400 lbs. So any time John Cena "struggles" to life Big Show or Henry or someone like that, it's pretty much total bullshit. Practically every guy on the roster can lift every other guy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree entirely. Anyone who dedicated their life to pro wrestling should understand the value of using a real life death in an angle. Do you think Paul Bearer would have objected to the way his death was handled to fuel the Punk and Undertaker feud? He would've loved it. Wrestling is not real life, and no one's feelings should be hurt by a storyline ESPECIALLY when a close family member signs off on it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got that game with my Xbox 360 for Christmas right after launch. I played and beat the campaign but never liked the multiplayer at all. Overall I thought the game was pretty mediocre even back then. The graphics were awesome, the cover mechanic was well done, and I liked the few sections where you could pick whether to take the left path or right path and your partner would take the other one. Beyond that I never really played it again and didn't get any of the sequels.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey all. This is my first time building a PC. I am switching over from Mac after realizing they are really underpowered for graphic-intensive work. I'm not much of a gamer, but photo and video work is my bread and butter and I am getting into 3D rendering (blender) and motion graphics (after effects) as well. I'm not *completely* sure what I'm doing when picking parts, so I'm hoping you can advise if the below build makes sense or if there are any problems you can see that I will run into. Wouldn't mind knocking a few bucks off the price as well if you see an opportunity. Thanks!

###Build Help/Ready: Help

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Yes

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

Photo and video editing, along with motion graphics and light 3D rendering (I'm new to it). Gaming is nice but not a big priority.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings)**

Medium or low settings are fine with me. I mostly play older games anyway.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

Around $1200

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

USA

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp) Don't ask to be spoonfed a build (read the rules!)**.

**EDIT:** After receiving some advice and doing more research, here is a revised build using a Ryzen CPU and a lower-end GPU. This allowed me to up the internal storage while still staying under $1200. Please give me your thoughts on it!

<TEXT> I worked there briefly. I only saw Vince in the elevator lobby one evening when we were both leaving for the day, but I did bump into Triple H in the men's room. Vince I'm sure has his own bathroom. 

The office is really cool for any wrestling fan. TVs in the elevators and cafeteria playing wrestling 24/7. I was there before the WWE Network was a thing but I'd imagine it's all Holy Foley reruns these days. 

If you watch that old WWE Super Bowl commercial from the attitude era, that was all filmed in the office and it's pretty much the same today.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> WWE has a long history of putting giants on TV that don't know how to work and protecting them by hiding their weaknesses. From Zeus to Kamala to Giant Gonzales to Khali to Nathan Jones to a few dozen other guys we've long forgotten. Even Braun was a mess when he first debuted. They figured they could hide her weaknesses but with a female roster so thin, and women's wrestling having such a spotlight on it today, that's not as easy as it used to be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I trained for six months and never reached the point of having my first match. The hardest aspect by far is cardio. You don't have to be big. You don't have to be very strong, but you do have to be in excellent condition to not get blown up in seconds. 

But even beyond the physical component, there's a mental component that nobody seems to talk about. Wrestling is its own language, and I just could never pick it up. I knew a bunch of words, but I couldn't put a sentence or paragraph together, much less a whole story. 

When working out a match a seasoned wrestler can say to another something like "throw me to the corner, up and over, duck the line, dropkick, I'll climb the buckle, you hit the ropes, nut shot, throw me, big splash, kickout, false finish..." and the other guy will get it and remember it right away. A lot of our drills were like that. It's one thing to see that sequence typed out, it's another thing to hear it dictated to you in 7 seconds and not be like "wait what?" 

And lastly, it's very time consuming. Even though training was only six to nine hours a week, the rest of the week you have to be working on your cardio, studying matches, working on your promo abilities, etc. It's something you have to commit to full time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The downside of Talking Smack is that not everybody is talented enough to pull off what they're trying to do on that show. Baron Corbin and Alexa Bliss can knock it out of the park every week, but some guys are still clearly not allowed to get anywhere near a microphone. I'm of the opinion of throwing guys in the deep end though until they learn to swim. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The MSM has pointed out on almost every occasion "President Trump's administration claims 2-3 million votes were cast illegally *despite providing any evidence to support that claim*." They say it every single time. If the evidence exists for such a salacious accusation, they need to cough it up. 

It sounds like you're saying 2-3 million voted illegally, the left is saying "Prove it." And you're saying "No. You prove that they didn't." That's bananas.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> People in the arts are almost always left-leaning. "Celebrities" for the most part means actors, musicians, performers. It's not easy to find conservative people in those fields, so naturally Hollywood leans left. 

Secondary to that, political activism is a major component of being an artist of any sort. So when people say "Why doesn't So and So just shut up about their views and play their music?" the answer is because that's not what artists are here to do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Firstly, I think this is bullshit. It's what smarks want to hear, but Austin has said on his podcast on a few different occasions that schedule conflicts get in the way of him doing more with WWE. That's why Jericho did one of those episodes instead of him.

Secondly, Ambrose has been awkward and unlikable on every podcast I've ever heard him on.

Thirdly, WWE should pony up the dough to give Austin a weekly or even daily talk show a la Tuesday Night Titans and watch the network subscriptions go through the roof. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all. My Nikon D600 stopped accepting lenses with their own aperture rings today. No matter how much fiddling I do with the ring, the contacts, or any moving parts on the mount, I continue to get the flashing fEE error indicating the camera and lens aren't communicating properly.

I tried the aperture ring lenses on other camera bodies and they work fine. I tried a non-aperture ring lens on the broken body and it works fine. So it has to be something with the camera's aperture "ring" that is rotated back when the lens is mounted. To the naked eye, everything seems fine. I tightened a loose screw in the mount but that didn't resolve it. 

By chance has anyone had this issue before? And if I have to send it in for repairs, any recommendations on a reputable place?

EDIT: I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne7cB0sXgK8) which looks to be exactly the issue I'm having. Even though I have a D600 and not a D7000, the part is probably the same. I'm going to try to make the repair myself next week and will update. </TEXT>

So are we supposed to cheer for Orton now? And Luke Harper can just go fuck himself? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-11-06 15:30:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all. I have a 2010 iMac with 12GB ram and an Ati Radeon HD 4670 with 256 mb vram. I managed to get Windows 10 installed on it and occasionally will boot up in windows to do some gaming. I was wondering if upgrading to the 2016 base model Macbook Pro laptop and using my iMac as a second display would be a step up or a step down graphically for gaming. I realize typically laptops have much weaker graphics cards and I don't want to break the bank with a souped up version since I'm a pretty casual gamer. </TEXT>

<TITLE> 2012 Elantra - extremely bumpy rear suspension </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-15 01:54:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all. I've had my Elantra for two years, but in the past couple months have noticed it becoming a very bumpy ride on my commute. Little bumps in the road are very noticeable and potholes have lifted me off my seat. Everything I've been reading about shocks and springs and struts seems to indicate that the car should feel much floatier and bouncier when the suspension is getting worn out, but my ride is instead getting way stiffer and bumpier. What could be causing this?

Edit: I want to add that I haven't noticed the car favoring any particular side or wheel. Additionally I had two rear tires put on a few weeks ago after noticing uneven wear on the rear driver side tire. They replaced the tires, did a wheel alignment, and reported nothing else unusual.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Their first appearance was great, with a lot of parallels to the Outsiders in WCW. Two guys that don't belong showing up with uncertain motives. But the mystique was quickly ruined by backstage promos, buddy buddy interactions with AJ Styles, and now their first match is happening already on a random Raw? They could have stretched this out for weeks and made it really unclear why they showed up and who's side they're on. Refuse to do interviews and keep showing up and causing chaos. Keep them unpredictable until they finally beat up Reigns and side with AJ or vice versa at Payback. 

The way it stands now, it's like AJ invited his two loser buddies over to WWE. They're already second fiddle and seen as his side kicks.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Routine help] How would you treat my acne scarring? (pics inside) </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all. I had some bad acne in my teen years and early 20s, and now am left with skin that looks damaged and weathered, along with some rolling scars and large visible pores.

I'm looking for advice on what products could best repair my skin to grow anew and cover up the old damage. I'm not concerned about active acne because I know that will come and go, but the damaged skin never seems to improve.

For a while I used a retinol cream at night, and now I'm testing out an MSM cream. I've also experimented with needle rolling, but I'm not sure it really works. I moisturize daily in the morning with an spf 30/moisturizer and occasionally use benzoyl peroxide on active pimples.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Despite some great main event storylines, the period from about 2007 to 2010 is characterized by WWE trying to make stars out of

Carlito
Shelton Benjamin
Mr. Kennedy
Brian Kendrick
Ezekiel Jackson
Vladimir Kozlov
Kizarny 
Lance Cade
Trevor Murdoch
The Highlanders
Jesse   Festus
MVP
Elijah Burke
Kevin Thorne
Sylvester Terkay

All of which fizzled out and left the company within two or three years (or much less). Though we got a few long term stars in Santino, Kofi, CM Punk and Natalya during this period, it was generally a stagnant period for talent development. Why do you think that is? Was it just a case of bad luck or were WWE putting their money on the wrong talents? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know a lot of this sub tends to train for looks more than function, but I'm hoping some experienced athletes or couch potatoes-turned-athletes can lend some advice. Though I've never been overweight, I've led a mostly lethargic life for 25 years. Now I'm training to be a pro wrestler, up to six hours a week and the biggest thing holding me back is cardio. Even after nearly six months of training, my cardio is lagging far behind most of the class and I get completely gassed to the point of collapse way too quickly when running drills. I know I really need to spend more time running and sprinting at home, but I'm wondering if there's anything else I'm neglecting. Maybe I need more protein? Is cardio mostly just genetic? Any advice is appreciated.  </TEXT>

The social climate is different and they'd get a lot more backlash this time around if they make the girls parade around in bikinis and mud wrestle. With the NXT explosion going on and the increased interest in indie wrestling is it possible the Diva search will feature more indie girls? Undoubtedly there will be some untrained fitness models in the mix, but it would be sweet if the likes of Leva Bates, Veda Scott, Mia Yim, Candice LeRae, etc. were all involved in the competition and instead of a beauty pageant they performed in fitness trials, promo contests and matches.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally I hate the "collegiate wrestler" gimmick. It's not even a gimmick. Going back to Mike Rotundo, the Steiners, team Angle, Jack Swagger and now Sawyer Fulton, Angelo Dawkins and that other Olympian guy in NXT. All they do is slap a singlet on a guy and now he's an interesting character? It's just lazy.  </TEXT>

It got me thinking about how I work with people who put in 80 hours a week in pursuit of making money and climbing the corporate ladder, while to me being home and having free time to myself is far more important. I make enough to cover my needs, plus go out and have a meal or good time with friends once in a while, and that's enough for me. I'm not material and don't chase fancy clothes or a sports car.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was just thinking today about how people idolize and respect people who may have actually been huge dickheads. For example look at John Lennon who is idolized the world over but you also hear a lot of horrible things about him beating women and being a racist. So was he a good man with a few flaws, or a colossal asshole with a sugarcoated reputation? So I would be interested in a subreddit where someone is brought "to trial" and redditors can make their case on whether the person did more harm than good or vice versa. Everyone would learn something and we could start maybe respecting people who deserve it. Some figures we could discuss:

Walt Disney
Steve Jobs
Mahatma Ghandi
Mother Teresa
The Dalai Lama
Donald Trump
Bill Gates
Michael Hayden
Rudy Giuliani
Thomas Edison (everybody's favorite)
General MacArthur
Vladimir Lenin
Hugh Hefner
Larry Flynt

Does anyone else think this might be cool? </TEXT>

<TITLE> How to loop a playlist of videos indefinitely on a TV? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-30 18:42:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey all. This isn't exactly related to cordcutting but cordcutters would be the best people to ask. I'm wondering if there's any possible way to do this without getting into complicated XBMC and Raspberry Pi stuff. I'm the video guy for a restaurant company and I would like to set up a TV in one of the restaurants that plays videos from our youtube channel all day. I've already discovered that streaming them from youtube is virtually impossible, seeing as how a continuous loop of plays would artificially inflate view counts and sap their servers. The best way to do it is probably to upload the videos to a USB drive. I know the Roku 3 has a USB port, and possibly other devices do as well, but do any of these allow you to loop a playlist continuously?

Thanks! </TEXT>

But I was laying in bed last night and thinking about my life and worrying about what I could be doing better and whatnot...is that anxiety? Is any kind of worried thinking anxiety?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Maybe wreddit is a little more mature than other online wrestling communities, but what I'm seeing from the IWC by and large is people being disgusted with WWE's booking decisions, demoralized by the fact that one of the most talented workers in history is being pushed aside for a D List movie star, and sickened by WWE constantly taunting the fans about never giving them what they want. 

And yet those same people snatched up the WWE network this morning without hesitation. Without thinking that maybe signing up for WWE's new subscription service does nothing but show support for the company and their decisions. 

Nothing matters more to WWE than its stockholders, and few things matter more to them than Wrestlemania's buyrate. It's an annual indication of the company's success. The Network being a smash hit only encourages WWE to stay the course. If you want to show your dissatisfaction with the company, don't get the network until at least after WM 30. Because you can't complain about the booking while simultaneously continuing to hand the company your money.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> I think Batista is only in the main event of WM because he negotiated his way there. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-29 20:52:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is just my personal theory, but I'd like to hear your thoughts.

I think when WWE found out The Rock wasn't available this year, they panicked. They thought "Who can we get that will bring that nostalgia factor, and who is relatively known outside of WWE? Brock isn't enough. Stone Cold has his own projects going on. What about Batista? You know the guy that's done nothing but talk shit about our company since he left? He was in that kung fu movie and he has a major Marvel movie coming out this summer. Perfect!"

So they hit up Batista and he says he'll only come back if he gets a key to the Divas locker-room, he's booked to win the Royal Rumble, and headline Wrestlemania 30.

Why else would WWE give a mediocre B-list Superstar and G-list movie star like Batista the main event of their 30th annual Wresltemania unless they had to? 

It's the only way to me that this whole thing makes sense.

<TITLE> What is the smoothest wrestling video game out there? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-12-23 01:51:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was just playing some WWE 13, and honestly the gameplay is a piece of shit. It's clunky and awkward with tons of problems and no fluidity or semblance to what actual matches look like. Then I was thinking back to No Mercy, which was a lot of fun but still slow paced and labored especially when grappling. The Smackdown series was no better, and arguably worse. There's never been a game that I know of that has the fluidity of animations that something like the Batman games or Ninja Gaiden has.

I was thinking how great it would be to have a game about indy wrestling that embraces the culture of it and doesn't try to be a WWE knockoff. Featuring all the top stars in the indy circuit and plenty of different high school gyms, bingo halls, VFWs, etc. Kind of how NBA Street had lots of different blacktops with their own personalities. And it features the indy style which is more fast paced with bigger spots and more reckless moves. Sadly this'll probably never happen. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2013-12-11 04:53:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm 24. I've been doing wedding photography since I was 16. I've shot about 20 weddings alone, and probably 50+ as a second shooter. I designed my website myself, which you can see [here](http://johngallino.com). I did a decent amount of work in 2009 and 2010, but since then it's dripped down to almost zero. I have a handful of events booked for next year, but no weddings. I'm in north NJ which is a very saturated and competitive market and I've focussed the last few months on improving my SEO and getting more hits with google adwords. I get about 8-10 a day now, presumably from people who looking for exactly what I'm providing, but it doesn't seem to be translating into sales. 

There's a number of things about being a business owner that I really dont like, so I've tried to build around and find alternatives. I don't go to networking events or seminars or anything. I have a facebook for the company but don't use twitter or instagram aside from my personal accounts. I have a partner who helps me sometimes but most of the business I do alone. I shoot alone and do my own post. I offer wedding albums but don't make a big deal about it because I don't enjoy making them. But they are certainly an option advertised with my wedding rates. I keep my rates low because I like to do everything digitally. Hardly ever do prints and recently have been offering digital downloads instead of mailing a disc. But when I do my job I am very good. I am great with people and have had many happy and return customers. I do great in sit-down interviews with potential clients, but I hardly have any of those anymore.

I think I just need more exposure and more brides need to be aware that I exist. I'd appreciate any advice you can give!

EDIT: I've removed the offending Editorial section and bikini pic :) The page now takes you directly to the events section. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I worked with the writing department of World Wrestling Entertainment for four months. AMA </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I worked as a Writers Assistant for the WWE during the period of September 2011 to January 2012 in their headquarters at Stamford, CT. It's an entry level job that had me spend all day every day with the WWE writing "home team" and partake in creative discussions. 

I've chosen not to do this AMA on /r/squaredcircle because I feel they'd ask very specific wrestling questions and I wanted this to be more geared towards the non-fans curious about how WWE and professional wrestling works. I'm incredibly passionate about pro wrestling as an industry and an art form and hope to inspire people to take it more seriously and appreciate its nuances. It's a very complex art that only appears simple on the surface and I've always felt the stigma it gets as redneck or low-brow television is unwarranted. It combines athleticism, acting, theater, spectacle, choreography, violence, humor, drama, and much more. I'm excited to answer any questions I can about WWE and pro wrestling as a whole. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've just always been a very calm even-keeled person. There's things I really like for sure and I get a little excited when something crazy happens on a TV show I like or something like that. But as far as daily life I'm never really excited or energetic about anything. It's kind of a bummer when people say "Can't you be more enthusiastic?" or take offense to me not being excited about something that they're excited about. I wish I could change but nothing really moves my enthusiasm needle. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I think when most people say "fag" they really mean "try-hard" </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Out of respect for my gaybro friends, I generally don't like to use the word "fag" or implying that gay = lesser. But the word "fag" often seems like just the PERFECT word to describe certain people. Today I had the realization that what I've really been meaning by "fag" this whole time is try-hard. That's why South Park was calling Harley Davidson bikers fags. That's why Louis jokes about the fag that says "people from Phoenix are Phoenicians." That's why you hate the fag in the Ed Hardy shirt using pick up lines at the bar that he googled last night. It all comes down to being a try-hard.

So personally I'm gonna start saying try-hard instead.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Does anyone remember.... </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Way back in the earlier days of the internet, probably around 1998 or 1999, I stumbled upon some pictures supposedly of Chyna getting gangbanged by members of DX. I think there were only four or five pictures, and only one or two included her face (and no male faces) so they were probably fakes. However one identifying feature that I distinctly remember is that one of the guys in the picture had [Road Dogg's finger tattoo](http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/166/5/1/road_dogg_photo_2_by_windows8osx-d53mye4.jpg). So either these were somewhat legit, or someone paid great attention to detail.


Anyway, is there any chance anyone else saw these pictures years ago? I want to be sure I didn't just dream this. I don't think I did because I was only 9 or so at the time and these pictures were VERY explicit and burned in my memory. </TEXT>

<TITLE> WWE has some of the best editors in TV. What effects are used in promotional videos like this? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-08 01:59:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Any wrestling fan knows that WWE has been notorious for their excellently edited promo videos that serve to summarize a storyline to promote its culmination at the next pay per view event. I noticed they use in particular, a lot of color effects, some visual effects (magic bullet? No idea) and a LOT of speed ramps. What would be the best way to make a video like this? After Effects? Something else? Any guidance would be helpful.

Here are two examples:

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Forgive my rant here, but I just don't see a light at the end of the tunnel any more. Not when the prices of everything are going up, while the portion sizes of everything from toilet paper rolls to Big Macs are shrinking every year. Not when television has degraded to the point that a decent cable and internet package means over $150 a month for 500 channels full of awful low-budget reality shows. When innovation has been snuffed out of all major forms of media, even video games. It is much safer economically to make Call of Duty Modern Warfare 7 than try a new idea. Iron Man 3? Spider-Man 4? Avengers 2? TMNT? GI JOE? And any other crap that people may have, at one point, heard of in their childhood? Let's make it, because it's the only way to make money anymore. Because going to the movies costs $12 a person, and only kids are still interested in new releases.

Speaking of kids, we have 2-3 entire generations of kids forever burdened with crippling student loan debt they won't pay off until they're approaching retirement, with millions more graduating every year. The oil companies have conditioned us to think that $3.50 a gallon for gas is a good deal. Millions of jobs have been shipped overseas, because the West doesn't make anything anymore. Adjusting for inflation, real wages have been steadily dropping in the US since their peak forty years ago, yet corporate profits are at inexplicable all-time highs. 

I don't know what's happened. It seems that everything is just gradually going to shit, like we're all stuck in a flushing toilet. But I know that can't be true. Corporations and greed and mass production have been around for over 50 years, there's no reason for them to *just now* start to ruin the country. The 70s were dark, the 80s looked dark, but the 90s were a period of economic prosperity. Things CAN turn around. So what am I missing? Am I wrong here? Are things going to get better? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've noticed growing up that every chinese food place has an almost identical menu. But it's not just the menu items. Everything from the visual design of the menu, to the old faded pictures of the dishes surrounded by flowers and lace on the walls and clearly not taken in the restaurant you're standing in, match from place to place. Yet they all appear to be mom-and-pop businesses owned by immigrants. These immigrants, I imagine, have to learn how to prepare this faux Chinese american crap because real Chinese food is quite different from what I've heard. So how do they learn the dishes, get their menu just like everyone else's, and get the photos to put on the wall? Is there some kind of conglomerate LoMeinCo who specializes in Chinese restaurant supplies? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is there really a massive gay underground in Hollywood? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-09-19 18:50:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For years everyone's heard rumors that guys like Tom Cruise and John Travolta are gay. Today I was reading that Seth Macfarlane, Elijah Wood, and Hayden Christiansen are secretly gay. It seems in Hollywood even the straight guys are sometimes gay. The masseur that Travolta supposedly tried to have sex with reportedly said:
 that he got where he is now due to sexual favors he had performed when he was in his Welcome Back Kotter days. Hollywood, Travolta explained, is controlled by homosexual Jewish men who expect favors in return for sexual activity, adding that he had done things in his past that would make most people throw up. Travolta remarked that when he started out, he wasnt even gay and that the taste of cum would make him gag. But he was smart enough to learn to enjoy it, and when he began to make millions of dollars, that it all became well worth it. While the masseur had Hollywood looks, Travolta added, he just needed to lose some weight and learn to lick some ass.' At that point, the masseur would be ready to make millions and be famous.

So what the hell is going on exactly? I don't personally have any issue with someone being gay or straight, but this seems to go beyond sexual orientation and into a culture of bizarre exploitation. Has anyone looked into this? Is it all just rumors and hearsay or is there evidence that this is really the way Hollywood works?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Over the past weeks many of you have taken the test at ISideWith.com and found out that your political beliefs are more in line with a third party candidate than either Obama or Romney. I feel that Obama already has this election in the bag and it's not even going to be close, so this is the year we can try to send a message without risking taking votes away from a major candidate. I know there are GOP and Romney supporters on this board, so excuse me if I sound like I'm speaking directly at the dems and liberals, but it's no secret reddit skews left.

This year, I know Obama doesn't need my vote to win the election. Especially not from my already-blue state. So instead I'll be voting for Jill Stein, the candidate that I side with the most according to the above test. Not because I think she has a snowball's chance in winning, but to show my support for third parties in general. I feel that Reddit as a community should come together and do the same. I'm not asking you to vote for Stein, but to vote for anyone but Obama or Romney. Let's show America that third parties deserve more attention than they're getting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know this is a complicated and subjective question, but I've noticed that it is very rare for me to exchange money for goods or services and feel like I got my full money's worth. In fact, any time you actually do get your money's worth on a purchase people proclaim what "a great deal" or "a steal" it is, because the converse is so much more common.

Example (in the US): I go to Five Guys and get a burger, fries and a drink. If you were to ask me what a good burger, fries and a drink should cost, I'd say about $8. However this would actually cost me closer to $11. If you go to McDonalds and get a shitty Big Mac, fries and a drink -- to me this inferior meal is worth about $5, but in actuality costs closer to $8. 

It seems everything in the grocery store costs $1 to $4 more than it's worth, and the price/value disparity seems to grow bigger with more expensive items. Do I just have a weird sense of value, or is there any statistical proof that an item is overpriced, and what causes it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm surprised there isn't a CarShoppingAdvice subreddit for this actually.

Anyway I drive a 95 Camry which I love. It's been very good to me but with 220k miles and nagging wear and tear I think it's almost time to put it down and move into the 21st century.

Admittedly I don't really know squat about cars other than basic maintenance. I work in film and TV production, so my biggest criteria is that my next car have ample trunk space for equipment. For this reason I was considering maybe a mid-2000s Rav4 or CR-V. However maybe an SUV is not necessary, I don't know.

I'm looking for

- low maintenance

- decent gas mileage (18+ city preferably)

- trunk space for production equipment

- 4 Doors

I live in the northeast US and my budget is about $8000 give or take.

Any advice would be appreciated! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yesterday I was quite productive, working on a project until 4 AM. However today I did nothing. I woke up late, laid around, surfed the web, and didn't leave the house. I have days like this AT LEAST once a week. Maybe it's because I'm self-employed, and rather lazy about it, or because I still live with my mom so I don't have to do much around the house, but even when I'm older and self-sufficient, I can't imagine not having days like this on a regular basis. Then I see people on TV like Michelle Obama on the Colbert Report tonight, and wonder if she ever has days like this where she does absolutely nothing productive, or if that's just something loser manchildren do and real adults are busy every day. Perhaps reddit isn't the best slice of the global population to survey, but did you reach a point where you stopped having regular days of doing nothing? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just recently discovered NoFap, but I'm getting kind of mixed messages about who it's actually for. It seems a lot of people engage in the NoFap 90 day challenge because they have a problem with porn addiction and want to reclaim some control over their habits. That's fine, but what if you're not an addict? Are there other benefits to not masturbating for long periods of time? Does it affect your brain in a positive way?

Speaking personally, I've found in the past that not having any kind of "release" for a long time really messes up my judgement and leads me to go to extraordinary lengths and wastes of time, money and energy in hopes of getting laid. However some things I've read here claim that feeling goes away eventually, and once you get over the hump you are actually MORE clearheaded and more focussed than ever.

Can anyone who has abstained for a long time please explain how it has positively affected your life, aside from beating an addiction? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I live in New Jersey. It's been good to me, but last summer I spent a month travelling through the northwest and found several beautiful areas I loved. Specifically, I'm hoping to move to Arcata, CA.

Some concerns....I don't know anyone out there. I have a little bit of money saved up (less than $10,000) and I don't know how easy it is to find a job out there. I've never lived on my own before, but have a pretty low standards. 

Ideally I'd like to build up an email relationship with someone that lives there that would let me live with them for a few weeks until I got settled and found a job. Maybe I'm going about this all wrong. Is there a subreddit for moving far away?

Any advice would be appreciated.

Note: I don't smoke weed, and weed has nothing to do with why I want to move to Humboldt County. </TEXT>

They also played great stand up specials from the 80s like Gallagher and Sinbad that were clean for daytime audiences.

So if you're trying to pitch a spec comedy script, how do you explain "This is funny only if it's delivered a certain way. If he just says it it won't work." What are some good examples of modern comedy scripts that have a lot of written jokes? I found an old draft of 40 Year Old virgin and it's fucking terrible. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Imagine a site where you can go when you are stressed out, or depressed, or just lonely that will connect you with another person who is willing to hear you out and help you get through tough times. 

You make an account and whenever you're on the website you select whether you are currently a TALKER or a LISTENER. 

If you are a talker, the site will present you with a list of available listeners currently online, along with a little paragraph they wrote about themselves. You pick the one you want to talk with. When you're done with the conversation, you can rate the Listener with a Thumbs Up/Down depending on if they helped you. 

Listeners work on a karma system based on these ratings, so abuse of the system will lead to negative karma and eventually banishment from the community. 

I think this is a great idea for people who are hesitant or can't afford a real therapist, and just need a friend or some advice. Then when they're feeling better, they can pay it forward by helping other people who need some support.

What do you think? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got a $130 ticket yesterday for something that I see at least 5 people doing on any random drive to the store. I don't think it's right to be suddenly "busted" for something that cops let slide ALL THE TIME. Either enforce it all the time, or don't criminalize it at all. And to suggest that holding the phone in my hand is any less safe than a hands-free set is preposterous. A distracting conversation is a distracting conversation whether it's on the phone, coming over your car speakers or with the person riding shotgun.

And by the way, I wasn't having a casual conversation with a friend. I had just received the call from a potential employer that I'd been anxiously awaiting for for days. I even told the cop this, but of course he didn't care. </TEXT>

Now I've been seeing a girl on and off for a few months and although I feel like I love her when we're together and hanging out, when we're apart I kind of don't care. I meet girls I think are beautiful and I think I fall for them but then the next day I forget about them and go back to not caring. I feel like I've just lost interest completely in love and romance and I don't understand why. Has this happened to anyone else?

And it really wasn't that bad. I doubt I'll get a call back, but I felt really good just for going for it.

<TEXT> I feel like I have a lot of skills to offer, but my submitted applications have all been dead ends so far. I was a professional photographer for 5 years. I've dealt with people. Ran my own business out of my bedroom. Now that the economy sucks, I barely book any jobs anymore (and I fell out of love with it anyway) so I'm looking for video gigs. I can direct, gaff (light scenes), edit, color correct, do graphic design and web design. I've been applying to gigs on mandy but no luck. I'm right outside of NYC too, so you would think there's an ocean of jobs there, and there are but they're not interested in me.

Also, another problem I have is that I'll be away for a week in June to help a friend film a documentary. How do I explain to an employer that I really need the job, but also need a week off just a couple of weeks after they hire me?

It's getting to the point where I'm considering just applying for Blockbuster or AMC theaters or something like that and taking minimum wage. It's just a shame to take an unskilled-labor position when I actually have a good amount of skills. </TEXT>

I'm not saying we should disband the military, but couldn't we possibly cut a few hundred billion? Why is that taboo to even propose? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Now, just to clarify, I'm a relatively attractive dude. If I really put effort into going out, getting girls drunk, or relying on charm, I could probably get laid the old fashioned way. But I realized I have other shit to do, and don't really care that much about sex. So when I get horny, I crank one out and continue my day clear-headed. Anybody else stop caring about sex? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lately I've been encountering a lot of these new ads on the internet that are basically full-on TV commercials playing automatically next to the web content. Whether they're for Lysol or a car company, they are the most obnoxious thing since pop-ups. What can we do as a community to put a stop to this practice?

<DATE> 2011-01-18 04:40:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm in kind of a unique situation. I'm a film student that put together a one-hour documentary completely on my own, including filming and editing it. It cost me nothing to make other than time, so there were no funds raised or anything like that. However, the film is quite good and has a strong chance of being selected into some major film festivals and likely being bought by a TV network (hopefully HBO). My professor saw a rough cut of the film that I gave to her to get some feedback and she got really excited about it. She wants to be my "producer" in the sense that she has navigated the film festival market and cutting deals with distributers before and she wants to help me with those things for my film. In the case that the film rights sold for X amount of money (lets say $10,000 to make it simple), what percentage would normally go to a "producer" like this? </TEXT>

Ideally we'd like the story to get picked up by the Assosciated Press so it can go national.

Before you ask: They couldn't pee. The only option that was valid according to the Guinness rules was a catheter, which they opted against. Matty couldn't hold it anymore and pissed himself about 4 hours prior to the end.

<DATE> 2010-07-06 07:02:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A few years ago she was a normal girl and a good friend, now she constantly refers to her being a Christian and being saved and whatnot. She's going on a missionary trip to cambodia this summer and posted a note on facebook asking for people's prayers and financial support.

Quote from the note:
"Seems crazy that I've only been a Christian for 3 years, but God has been doing amazing things and I'm really excited to see what He's been doing in Cambodia. Maybe you're not Christian and you don't care about missions and God-related things. I still ask that you take the time to pray for me. God has been so amazing in my life and it's a big deal for me to take this step of faith for Him. After meeting Jesus three years ago, He has continued to show me how broken my life is, but how i can be alive in Him. I thought Christianity was a set of rules, but its definitely not. Having a relationship with God has opened up my eyes to the person He wants me to be."

I mean this stuff freaks me out. I'm glad that she's happy and I'm all for people believing what they want to believe, but the way she talks about religion now is both sad and scary to me. I feel like I've lost a friend to a cult. I'm not mad at her by any means, but instead at the people who've brainwashed her with this shit. </TEXT>

Sort of a channel that would just constantly display a slideshow of random images, whether taken from deviantart or flickr or the New York Times or anything. Just a never-ending deluge of imagery to chill out to and watch while I listen to music. Maybe if it was a software, you could customize what kind of images you like. Perhaps a Like or Dislike option for each one, and if you wanted to know more about an image, you could just click it and get the photographer/artist/story behind the image.

<TEXT> I tried craigslist, but then realized my fellow redditors are way more reliable.

Basically I'm an east coaster and have never been to LA, but I am currently writing a screenplay which takes place largely in LA and I want to bring the LA spirit into it.

In the first act our two protagonists realize they are fed up with their lives in New Jersey and decide to move to LA to live with one of their cousins, Chino, a Chicano ex-gang banger and East LA native. Much of the story will deal with the dissonance between their visions of Hollywood and the ugly realities of East LA and surrounding areas.

This is more the B story than what the plot is about, but I definitely need some questions answered periodically while I'm writing and hit dead ends. I'm looking for an LA native that I can email or text with questions on the fly about the area, and any knowledge of the chicano culture and gang life is a definite plus.

And yes, I'd love to fly out there and see it myself, but I can't afford it just yet! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Have you ever worked at a pet store? I'm researching for my screenplay.... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2010-03-14 20:13:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My protagonist works at a pet store for the first act of my screenplay, but I need a little insight into the daily or weekly routines that pet store employees go through. What kind of maintenance has to be done daily, weekly, monthly, and annually at a pet store? What type of activities might two employees do together because it's hard or impossible to do alone? My character is going to fall in love with his coworker at the store and I need some things for them to do other than sit around and chat while waiting for customers. Any insight would be appreciated. </TEXT>

<TITLE> All of the smartest and most creative people that I most admire just happen to be atheists </TITLE>

<TEXT> This includes Carl Sagan, Ira Glass, Richard Dawkins, Penn Jillette, Adam Savage, Howard Stern, Steven Soderbergh, Gene Wilder, John Malkovich, Seth MacFarlane, Bruce Lee, Dave Foley, Patton Oswalt, Doug Stanhope, Stephen Fry, Ricky Gervais, Paul Giamatti, Adam Carolla, Douglas Adams, Woody Allen, Andy Richter, Ian Mackellan, Robert Altman, Bjork, Wayne Coyne, Roger Waters, Kurt Vonnegut, AJ Jacobs, Stanley Kubrick, Roger Ebert, Matt Stone, and many more. I find it interesting that the members of society that I find to be most intelligent and open minded have all landed on the same conclusion of atheism. And yet despite that, atheists are still in a tiny minority of the world population. Makes me a sad panda. </TEXT>
