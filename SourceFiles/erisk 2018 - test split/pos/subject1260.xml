With PS4 having bloodbourne, infamous, Spider-Man , ratchet and clank and Crash amongst others the variety is there which Microsoft just don't have... yet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a PS3 but only played a few games. I did enjoy uncharted but wasn't a big fan of the last of us.

One of the features I love about the xbone is the backwards compatibility I hear there's something similar in psnow? Would you say that's good?

Another feature I love on Xbox is how many games they just give away. 4 a month and other games randomly or for things like Christmas. How does PlayStation compare on that level? Sorry for the questions but console purchases are massive decisions for me :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure thing, 

I guess first off it'll be right to say that I'm talking about the single player mostly. GTA is my favourite game series ever and have completed each entry multiple times (even V)

I feel GTA V loses a lot of the charm that made the other GTA's great. Telling a story with three protagonists isn't new grounds for the series at all. The ps2 games (3,VC and SA mainly) had one big story that was told over the course of 3 (and expanded in an additional two) games. This gave each character a full 20-25 hours to sink and for you get to know them. The HD era of GTA had one full game (GTA IV) and two expansions to tell its story with three characters. While the two expansions were shorter it was still their own campaign. GTA V's characters are all competing for game time and that makes me uninterested in them because I'm not given the amount of time to get to know them like the other games. 

Rockstar are also really good at writing and crafting story's and I felt that V's generic heist/revenge story was too basic. Especially after the plot of GTA IV (which admittedly had these elements but didn't focus on them) and Red Dead (which also had these elements) were so gosh dang good. 

I didn't find the majority of missions in GTA V that interesting either and none of the characters I found particularly engaging.

Multiplayer is a great concept but I think it lacks in execution and turns the whole thing into a grind / pay fest. I had countless hours on GTA IVs multiplayer just messing around. And while yes GTA V is also great with that I feel the game punishes you for doing so. Me and my friends used to go on free mode and just mess with each other but now if we kill each other we lose money. If we blow each other's cars up we have to get them back. It just feels so limiting and unfun.

Regardless of all this I do quite like GTA V but for me it doesn't feel like a GTA game at the heart of it. Don't hesitate to ask questions or give me some counter points. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We phoned each other last night and we agreed we would text during the day as she's at her moms so we can't see each other. Christmas is a really bad time for me as I have depression and just don't get in the Christmas spirit and I'm always alone at Christmas. Should I just let her enjoy it with her mom? Or is there a deeper problem here?


TL:DR - girlfriend didn't text throughout Christmas Day so I am now alone and lonely. Am I being petty or is there possibly something deeper? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have memory problems, like really bad and this summer I played through all 3 of the original halo games for the first time. I thoroughly enjoyed them and decided to take a break however as I want to move on to Halo 4 I can't remember what happened last time. I don't want to read 3 Wikipedia pages full of plots as that will bore and irritate me. Can anyone put a clear, concise plot review of just Halo 1,2 and 3 that I can refer to while playing?

I think because I played them all in one go the games didn't have time to go into long term memory. Thank you! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm part of /r/Xboxone and /r/Titanfall and both subs have people getting angry at people not buying games. Xbox One had a thread the other day about low Xbox one sales of FFXV and people complained that now Kingdom hearts is unlikely and people should be buying the game to support the company. Same happened when Recore came out people were getting angry and telling people to buy it because it was an Xbox exclusive. Similar things are happening with Dead Rising 4, people saying to buy it to show support to Xbox one exclusives when people don't want to.

I've seen it a lot this generation people getting angry and people not buying games, what is this about? It seems like madness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I'm obese. I used to never care about my apparence or anything to do with that but since getting a girlfriend I want to be the best I can be not just for her but for me to. I'm not comfortable in my body and I actively avoid the mirror. Comparing pictures of other 200+lb people I don't think I look that bad but I am.

I've decided that as part of my change I want to be accountable here with questions and problems I've encountered etc. Is that okay? I want to say everyday but probably be every other.

Currently trying to eat at 2000 calories. Let's do this.

<TEXT> Battlefield 1 is about the battle. It's about the comradery of everyone together. All for one for all! It's about being stuck in a trench with a few of your brothers, desperately trying to keep everyone alive. As a medic no one dies on my watch. It's a game of playing your role, Assaulting the vehicles, healing people, providing covering fire and supporting everyone. It's about war, real cold dirty war. 

In all seriousness I own both and they both are completely different games maybe Battlefield 1 isn't for you and Titanfall is. That's okay! They're both my game of the year. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The penalty for dying in Bioshock Infinite </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-25 12:46:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Yes I did a Bioshock post a few weeks ago to but ok replaying the games with an objective critical mind. One thing I didn't mention in Bioshock was the death system. In the first game you could just respawn over and over again eventually killing the enemy. I can't remember there being a penalty maybe other than some eve and money. However in the first one you could turn the vita chambers off making the game harder. In Infinite you just respawn a couple of feet away with less money and the enemy's gain some health, not all of it, some.

Playing Infinite on hard and I just find it too easy because I can exploit the death system, each fight has no sense of threat because I can just try try try again until it's done.

What is the real penalty of death in Infinite? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can you blame them? Ea access trials have convinced me to buy three games this year. 2 of which are my most played of the year. A beta isn't a complete representative of the final game sure, and yes people can acknowledge things have been changed.

<TITLE> Why is Bioshock so critically acclaimed? (Spoilers) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-01 22:45:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I played Bioshock a few years ago and it went near the top of my favourite games of all time lost. But I think I was revelling in the plot and the twist of the game. I'm replaying it now and while I do like it I do feel it's very repetitive. Each level is a series of rooms you go through, at some point you'll have to find 3 things to make something else to go on to the next bathysphere with a few big daddies in the way. The formula for the game is so repetitive in my opinion and I never found the combat very good either. With the right tonics you can make the game a breeze.

does this example as game as art only apply to story? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The arkham games are probably my favourite games of all time with City being my favourite by a hair. I'd love to own all these games on one console and I do think it's time for a replay. However I'm not one to buy shitty remasters and don't want to give a company my money for nonsense. Are they worth it or should I get bioshock instead? </TEXT>

There's loads of games that I feel don't need big open worlds but choose to have them? Why? And why do open world games sells anyway? </TEXT>

<TEXT> No I disagree. Pre ordering games just shows game companies you're willing to buy games before reviews come in and people play them which means most of the time they try and sell a broken product and get away with it. I mean they already have your money what is there to prove?  I've never preordered a game but if there's a game that I know I'm definitely going to get I never have a problem just going to the store and picking up a copy. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-07-10 17:56:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Context is massively important in this story. Me and my girlfriend have been really close friends for about 6 years, to the fact we used to call each other brother and sister. We stopped doing that a few months before we got together and well we got together. She said it again the other day when we were going somewhere. 'Shall we go bro?' however immeditedley said 'Oh that was weird' Ive been worrying about it ever since, maybe she doesn't see us as gf/bf anymore and has reverted back to thinking of me like a brother? What do I do?

[TL;DR] GF called me brother, and its confused me a little bit. Am I overreacting at a slip of the tounge or could there be more to it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It seems we knew exactly what we were getting with part 1. We knew two classes and a map. This one seems to be a bit more secretive other than we know about a new chomper customisation. What do you hope we get?

Honestly I hope they bring back Taco Bandits that was by far my favourite game mode in the first game.

Yeah I have thought this for a while, she tells me that she is but she never acts like it. Yesterday I sent her a text saying what I loved about her, like it was from a place of vulnerability and she just put a heart emoji back. Each day I feel more and more that a break up is coming. Thanks.

<TEXT> Heya guys. I've recently realised that I am very insecure in my relationship. Me and the gf have spoke about it and she's so loving and supportive but I just struggle to believe her. I struggle to believe it when she tells me she loves me. I think she's going to break up with me everyday. I think she can get someone better. If we don't talk one day I assume we are going to break up. I love this girl and I don't want to ruin that with my self esteem. I'm seeing a therapist but what are some other practical things I can do? </TEXT>

Some people (like us) just don't like texting, you have to adjust to that or if it's too much let her know how you feel about it. It may not change anything but at least she will know

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We've been together for 3 months and this is the first wedding we attended together we were both invited to the whole day of festivities and overall it was good. I don't like weddings or big parties though, I struggle at them and she know that. Throughout the whole day she kept talking to her friends who are more social and didn't ask how I was holding up or anything. 1 or 2 of her friends asked if I was okay as I'm good friends with a few of them and I just said yes. Heck at one point during the night I got up to dance with her (trust me getting on a dance floor is a big deal for me) and she just turned away and continued dancing with her friends. I felt so lonely. At the end of the day before I left (we were going with different people) I told her I loved her and she just said 'aww' and scrunched up her face. I feel pissed that she didn't show me much attention. Am I being ridiculous or do I have a right to feel angry?

TL:DR gf talked to her friends all day at a wedding when she knows I struggle at big party environments. Am I right to be annoyed? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Me and my gf have been going out for about two months now and all is on the outside going swimmingly. I have anxiety and we have worked together through some things but I generally seem to over react to things. We both attend a church and she seems to want to keep our relationship quiet. Not in a bad way we are just both that type of person. We haven't put anything on social media, because again we don't need to. But my head over reacts to all these things and thinks that she doesn't want to be with me. It's things like when she doesn't text back. For example yesterday she said she would text me before I went to work and she didn't. As I write this now I can see how I massively overreacted but I can't stop the thought that she doesn't want to be with me?

Reddit, how can I calm down? I'd like to talk to her about it but I'm worried it'd scare her off.

TL:DR - I have anxiety and keep thinking my girlfriend doesn't want to be with me because of little thing she does or doesn't do. How can I calm down? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently got into a relationship with my friend of 6 years, we both thought there was more going on and decided to give it a go. I'm her first boyfriend so she's new to be whole thing. We've been going out for about 2 months now and it's going fine, however she really struggles to show affection towards me. I'm the one who always texts first, goes in for a hug or kiss, phones her. She does those things sometimes but it's very far and few between. I don't want to put her off by going in too thick but sometimes it makes me feel that she doesn't want to be with me if I'm the one whose putting the majority of the work in. I want to help her to understand I like affection to and would like her to do those things. What should I do Reddit?

For example today we were on the phone before she said she had to go in the shower my mind just flipped.

Did the devs accidentally programme a jumps too high and say 'Ah fuck it, give them two'. Why would you need your character to jumps again in the air? It doesn't require additional skill as I can see it just means you can make higher/longer jumps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think there was enough new in the film to warrant it. People complained that the prequels didn't have enough parrells to the OT. While it did feel at times like we were retreading old ground the story still moved along, it's not the exact same plot. You have Kylo Ren, Finn and others which are similar yes but different characters. I just hope they don't do a I am you father thing in episode 8  </TEXT>

There are fps drops which for me is the worst sin. I've had the fps drop just from being in a fire fight with no explosions, it hasn't been the 17fps that has been reported but it's been noticeable.

<TEXT> I dropped money on an Xbox because my friends were on there and for Halo. I shouldn't have to fork over more money to play a properly optimised game. I get to buy maybe two games a year because of my finances and waited for this one. Why should I be punished for owning an Xbox  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fallout 4. The game is as vast as an ocean but as deep as a puddle. All of the main quest is uninteresting and boring and just flips the Fallout 3 story on its head. All the factions are so morally grey that it really doesn't matter who you choose, the voiced protagonist makes it a bad game to roleplay with and the lack of speech options or even skill speech options is annoying. All the new content they put in can't compensate for all the other stuff they took out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah sorry I made the post on my phone. I didn't mean to trash talk the game without proper reasons I wanted to evoke discussion as is the point of Reddit. Even things that are universally loved have flaws and as we talk and discuss them we can get better quality products in the future.

Edit: the factions never really explain what they want particularly well. All they do is trash talk each other making it hard to know who I'd want to align with. The only character I found interesting in the main quest is Nick Valentine , heck I constantly have him with me. Piper is just a journalist interested in getting people to wake up to the bigger truth. That's been done before and I don't find it particularly interesting. Father is just a bit of a dick and not that engaging and none of the other institute people are really memorable. As a game yeah it can be fun, exploring the wasteland? Great! It's the main reason I'm not selling it, I know I'll come back here and there to explore Boston but from an rpg stand point it just didn't excel. Fallout 3 made me in control of 99% of my character. I can give them a backstory, I empathise with having a dad more so than a child. I don't feel like I'm in the role of my character in Fallout 4. Which really should be the point of an rpg. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The main questline and characters are boring and uninspired, all of the factions are so morally Grey or uninteresting that it's not fun. My favourite bit of new Vegas was the factions and they just haven't implemented them well here. Settlements is fun for a bit but doesn't carry the game. Maybe one day I'll come back to it but Bethesda I'm sorry I'm just dissapointed.

Edit : I'm aware this isn't flesh out, let's try a bit harder..

<TEXT> I've seen people complain that Fallout 4 isn't as immersive as the other games of the series. But I've never really been immersed by any of them, each game has a plot and in the case of 3 you can't play the game after doing the main plot (without dlc). People want to play the game as themselves but the other games did have scripted events to which can take the player out of the immersion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not too sure if this is okay or the right place for this but I'm looking for an accountability partner online. Someone who is of the faith and we can email back and forth about our lives, struggles etc. I think it's good and healthy to have someone distant praying for you and I'm very eager to do that for someone else.

This feels like a dating add but this is my basic information..

Names Tom, I'm 20, Ive been a Christian for 5 years, I'm from the UK and I was diagnosed with depression this year. (So you know a little of my circumstance)

Thanks all! </TEXT>

<TITLE> What are your thoughts on Toby's Church Structure? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-11 13:30:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A few weeks ago now, but in episode 115, Toby did a little bit of reflecting and bought a way that church *could* look like for those who didnt hear the episode here's what he said...

Each sunday of the month, you'd have five different times together and five very different ways to do church..

1st Sunday = Do Sabbath for real - Cut yourself off from phone, technology etc and spend time with family and friends, having real discussion and real time together

2nd Sunday = Have a biblical teaching, that is actually teaching the Bible. Dont focus on me or the congregation and how we can apply it just teach the Bible and if the other stuff comes great!

3rd Sunday = Free for all in the Church Hall! People can bring and talk about whatever they want and what they believe to invoke discussion amongst the congregation

4th Sunday = A small talk on something relevant in the local community, the church or the world. Then split up into small groups and dicsuss.

5th Sunday = Music and food, a band just jams in the background as the congregation shares a meal and again real conversations open up.

And that's it. In the episode Matt did come up with some counter points but I was interested in what you guys think? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a friend named Jack. There are many stories I can tell about Jack but this is my favourite. I was chilling with a friend at his house when we saw Jack pass in a suit and tie carrying a briefcase. He normally wears shorts and a muscle tee, he's a gym geek, so we decided to phone him and ask why he was dressed so out of character. We phoned him and asked "Whats with the suit man?", he said that he had an interview. We were like "Cool man, where at?" he responded with "The Bank". Jacks never done accounting or had experience with money before so of course we asked why. "To open an account". We both were gobsmacked, this guy had dressed up in formal attire to set up a bank account and not only that but called it an interview. So curiously after laughing for a while we asked "What's in the briefcase then?" "Loads of heavy books, so that I appear smart if they ask questions"

We couldnt believe it, this is still probably the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really struggle with gluttony and eating and consuming. That also links to my struggle with money. Over the past week I have spent pretty much my entire wage on video games and food that hasnt been needed. As such I have decided that today I am going to fast food. I havent spoke to anyone about this but does this seem biblical? There seems to be many opinions online about repentance and fasting and I dont want to jump into something if it's not right and I definatley dont want to appear to be legalistic. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's worth pointing out that Banjo Kazooie, Tooie and Perfect Dark are all the Xbox Live Arcade Remakes of the games that occured in 2011. There was a texture and control upgrade and widescreen. So naturally those games play very very well. However the other N64 games such as Conker and Blast Corps play very well to in my opinion. </TEXT>

That's not my problem, I know the basics of the word of God and know what I want to read but never actually read it. I want to get serious about this but I have an awful attention span and just don't know how to approach the bible. I'm inclined to read the bible as I would any other book, but I just don't remember any of it. And if I take notes and have a companion text with me I get bored easily and it feels too school like.

<TEXT> I keep seeing people on this sub say that their favourite joke was the elephant joke. It was awful, 'Lets talk about the elephant in the room' Oh look its an elephant and he's in the room. Thats not funny. How he reacted isnt funny either it would have been better if he did a slight perk up as he listened but to get completley irate about it isnt the subtle writing I expect for Bojack Horseman. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How do I get my friends to give Titanfall a chance? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-22 10:11:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My general policy is that playing with friends is always a ton more fun than playing alone, trouble is I only have 1 friend who has the game on Xbox and he is more of a PC gamer. I love the game and seeing as you can pretty much get it for free this month I want to convince of my other friends to get it. They say they don't like it because it's too simple, or "Battlefield lite", however I think under the surface is a shooter they all would enjoy. None of them have tried it and are basing opinions on what they've heard. How would I go about convincing them?

Edit: I'm an awful speller.

<TEXT> Thats right! I have never played a Halo game. I found the series a bit boring seeing as I dont really like FPS' or Sci Fi that much. I had a 360 for Party chat and now have a One because thats what my best friend has and we play GTA together. However the Xbox exclusives have never done anything for me and I feel like Im missing out. 4 games for 25 pounds is an awesome deal so please, I just need a little bit of a push. 

2 questions;

Is there online co op on each game?
Are all the games remasters of the originals or just the Orignal game, for example is Halo 2 remastered or is it just the Xbox game? Same for Halo 3? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello everybody, so for my sons 15th birthday I deicded to get him an Xbox One with live, a mic and a few games. Our family has hit a bit of financial difficulty so buying it new wasnt an option, I got it from Gumtree. I got to the place and brought the console. He had 1 xbox one and a few xbox 360's, he told me he was a merchant and just kept selling them on. Of course I thought nothing of it, and took the console home. We set everything up for him, but then it hit me. What if the console was stolen? My sons on Xbox Live at the moment and because of his difficulties wont understand the situation. Can they track a stolen console to our house if its connected to live? Half of me believes the man who sold it but the other skeptical side doesnt. If the consoles gone we probably wont be able to afford another one this year. So... thats my day.


Edit: without reading the situation, the title is hilarious.

<TEXT> Have you ever waited for the next big thing?

The next big movie, the next big car?

The next big concert, or the next big song to sing?

Advertisers have make it quite clear

You need this product to live; the future is here!



And time, and time again we fall for it

We buy things we do not need

And fall into the dreaded consumer pit

We buy and we store 

Until are egos are swollen; and our wallets are sore



The anticipation then begins to start

Waiting for the next big thing

In that time we give that thing our heart

Counting down to the next big thing

Waiting eagerly for the next big thing



Friends let me take you back a few thousand years

To around 30 BC

Where we see Jesus there with his following peers

The messiah had come; to take on our plight

The Jews werent convinced; they wanted a warrior knight



He spouted things they just couldnt believe

Blasphemer! They called him

A crucifixion he was to receive

They stood before the King of Kings

And tore apart their next big thing.



Thank God the story didnt end there

We would be in trouble,

None of us would be heirs

Hes coming back though; let our hearts sing

For the coming of the next big thing.

<TEXT> Number 10: Meet Quan Chen. A Chinese Man with a Chinese hand makes a nice boy band. Play music through the night to forget about this sad plight.

Number 9: Soak in brine. The scars hurt now I can see, so get in a tub of hotdog pee! The saltiness will help with the hurt and the smell will help with her squirt.

Number 8: Just wait. These coy boys are coming back one day soon, TBS wont have them and neither should you...n.

Number 7: Collect money from Kevin. Kevins my friend and he said he's pay you when J A came to an end. Spend the money on anything you please, a logging company cut down trees!

Number 6: Suck my dicks. It's a toe now though and thats a shame maybe I could with it get my 15 minutes of fame.

Number 5: Hit a beehive. Why are you still alive? No J A your life is pointless, kill your body, make it jointless.

Number 4: Fall to the floor, wait there until theres a knock on the door. Its your mom knock her out, she doesnt know how you feel that grout scout.

Number 3: Climb a tree, take in the world around you, and then maybe you can do a crusty poo. Jump when you've had enough, because we've had enough... of you.

Number 2: Congratulate the crew, they did a good job and they're all golden rods. Tell them you want it back or else they will get a smack.

Number 1: Get over it it's done. Both Jake and Amir wont be here again, the deeds theyve done have unbalanced their zen. Wait for the TV show if it ever happens, but overall my mood... it dampens.

<TEXT> I am addicted to Masturbation. I dont think there is another word for it. Addicted. I simply cannot function without masturbating it's planned into my day. Wake. Masturbate. Just hit 12 at work? Masturbate? About to go to sleep? Masturbate. I have tried again and again to stop using things like God Over Porn and /r/NoFapChristians. But again and again daily I fail and fall over.

Recently I got bored of the stuff I was fantasizing to so experimented with some more... bisexual in nature fantasies. And they felt better than before! My routing had new breath poured into it and I cannot get enough. Does this make me Bi? I no longer know who I am.

I still love Jesus, go to Church, have meals with fellow believers and teach the youth etc. I am not ashamed of myself... yet. I dont want to be a damp and wet Christian, but I know that this cannot go on. I'm confused about myself and want to repent but everytime I have done in the past I come (no pun) to this point again.

Pray /r/TrueChristian. </TEXT>

Well we've prayed and me and my friend are going to be meeting him tommorow at a pub. My other friend goes to Bible college and is coming back for Easter so its going to be social however we're going to ask him if hes okay etc and try and understand and talk through some of his things. We prayed over Skype and felt this was right to do.

Thanks y'all! Will update again! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Heya all. As the title suggests I have a friend who is struggling with God and Jesus and the like. I thought I would come here to explain whats up and hopefully get some prayer and things I can do to encourage him.

Basically I've lived next door to him my whole life. In fact he's the one that got me to church etc. However recently he's been a bit distant. From September - January he attended Bible college, but left because he was enjoying it/homesick etc. However before that he got engaged. Since his return form Bible college, he hasnt attended church come to anything etc. I know its not about attendance at all, but anytime we try and talk about Jesus he changes the subject. Recently I asked how his relationship with Christ was and he just said "Not good, I dont want him". Recently his fiance (who lives away) came back for Easter and they havent been apart since, she just bought an Xbox One for him and thats all they do together. I'm worried about him, I love my brother and want him to be content and full of peace through the Lord.

Thanks for reading! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Heya all. I bought Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate about 3 weeks ago and unfortunately I am not enjoying it as much as I thought. Dont get me wrong it's an impressive feat and am impressed they can cram such a game into such a small cartridge.

It just seems to me that it's a game that you're meant to know what you're doing going in... and I dont. Killing Monsters gets a bit boring and the combat does seem to be a button masher, even though I've been told time and time again that it isnt.

What am I doing wrong? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Howdy yall, a couple of days ago I was wrestling with a bit of scripture [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/2y4ewo/help_me_understand_matthew_72123/)

And someone in the comments very helpfully put this

"Remember, it is not faith + works - salvation, nor is it faith + nothing - salvation, but rather faith + salvation - works."

So now I ask, what are these works? Does attening a prayer time or bible study constitute as works? What exactly are works?

Thank you all for joining with me on my journey. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was standing up on the train to work today and I suddenly got very very hot. The train was packed as it normally is I was listening to a Podcast and all I could hear was a buzzing noise eventually my eyesight went to. I pulled the chair down from behind me and sat down. I think I was dazed and confused for about a minute before I sat down, no idea what happened in that minute but I can hands down say it was terrifying. Suffering from social anxiety I really didnt want to pass out in front of everyone on the train. </TEXT>

Away from me, you evildoers!

Does this not go against what Romans 10:13 says? "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."

<TITLE> Why we love video games : Nintendo 64 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-26 11:00:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Obviously everybody here loves the N64 and with good reason. It's a fantastic console. I wanted to create a space where people can discuss their love for the console and **why** they love it so much.

As a kid I never owned a N64 and was instead bought a Playstation for my 6th birthday. Obviously back then I didnt care and loved (and still do) the console. My best friend who lived next door to me  however owned both. As we were both boys who were born 4 months apart we of course were best friends and I went over his house every so often to play his N64. I dont know what it was but those memories of Super Mario 64 and OOT are so crystal clear. The N64 (from what I played of it) was more adventurous. While I waiting for disks to load on the PS the cartridges loaded up the games in seconds. Everything was faster and (what I thought) bigger. I had Rayman, Toy Story 2 and Lego Racers to name a few games on PS1 but Mario 64, OOt, Mario Party and Dk 64 felt more alive. I spent years gushing over my friends N64 and him never really understanding why as he went on to get Xbox 360s and the like. But I now know that when I played the N64 it was the first time in a video game that I felt like I was bang middle of a great adventure. 

I went on to buy my Pikachu N64 a couple months ago, and coupled with the Wii U the only consoles I own. I would have it no other way.


TLDR: What are some of your N64 memories? </TEXT>

For me it's [Gruntys Industries] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shrzrH3F0z0). I love factory and industrial levels in games and the music caught that monotonous working environment to a T but still added enough to make the level fun! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Specs: Processor	Intel Core i5 (2.6 GHz, 3.1 GHz with TurboBoost, 3 MB cache)
RAM	8 GB DDR3
Graphics card	Intel Iris
Storage	256 GB SSD

Waffle: Howdy Y'all, looking into getting a Macbook today! Hooray! I was just wondering if I could play low end games such as Minecraft, Civ5 and the Sims 3 on it? Those kind things. I'm not using it for gaming primarily but would be nice to play with friends on Minecraft and Civ. If not will the 15 inch with an 17 Processor do it?

Thanks!

Edit: I'm also worried about the portability of the 15" so any opinions on that. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.

I want to play games such as Fallout 3, Skyrim those kind of things. I have no idea how intensive those games are but would also like to play GTA V when that comes out.


**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

At the end of the day I am still a student, and found a gaming laptop that could do what I wanted for just under 1000. So preferably below that because I heard building one would be cheaper.

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.**

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 10 - We're not friends. Jake and Amir come together like two peas in a pod and then yes one of them is a Golden Rod. A falling out, a boxing bout is the only thing to save these trouts.

9 - We're looking fine. We hit our peak, take your seat, tickets please you dirty sleaze. It's the end for us, the finale of the line, it took long enough, yes our sweet time.

8 - We want to masturbate. A webseries is fun to be sure, but I'd rather spend my time not being pure. A porno mag for this fine stag takes up my time, it's a steep uphill climb.

7 - It's time for heaven. A mass suicide is what we bargained for. Shoot ourselves in the head, blood pouring everywhere and guess what? I am bread.

6 - We're collecting sticks. Sticks has become more than a hobby, in fact I got in trouble with a British Bobby. Bit his ear off, and he had the year off. Hit the stick around his head and guess what? He is bread!

5 - We took a career skydive. People complained the quality wasnt on par, like a round of golf. Get in the golf car.

4 - They locked the door. We are stuck in this room with no way of escape. I will save the day put on my cape. No way out of here and no camera. Means no web series you panderer.

3 - Introducing Jake and Amir: The Movie. A feature length short is the perfect retort. On the big screen we take it and we dont even fake it. A hour and half short film is perfect and our own stage we will build!

2 - Gone for a P U. Poo being the operative term, we're a long way from sperm. Keep pushing and pushing and there is a lot of flushing. it's a mother lover and I have health cover.

1 - It was fun. 8 years of coy jews, doing coyish things like trust fall and sing. After my poo I will but fart. These diva roaches will forever be in my heart. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So today I worked out in the gym and burned 400 calories which was fantastic and was really happy. How when I do this My Fitness Pal (Great app btw) adds to the amount of calories I can have a day. I'm on a 1860 diet but My fitness pal says I can still have 2172. Should I heed the apps advice or still eat 1860 regardless if I've worked it off. Thanks all!

In your head you just think it's going to go on forever, when I watched Fish Scroll last week I had no idea. No one did. Jake and Amir have been massive inspirations in my comedic career, being two comedians who helped me pick the mic up in the first place. Their web series was just the start of my love for them. Without this web series where would I be? No idea. I suffered from depression for a good many years and through therapy and medication ,Jake and Amir kept me sane every week without fail. Kept me smiling. 

However this feeling is bittersweet and am so happy you two are willing to branch out with your careers. I know we all wish you the best of luck.

You two are heroes. I frickin mean it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> (Jake is sitting at his desk, working on his laptop. For a second he stops as Amir approaches with a swagger in his step and a song in his heart carrying a Cookie Monster Plush Toy)

Amir: They see me rolling, they hating, all because Im riding Bernie (As he says Bernie he points at Cookie Monster. Amir then stands there with his mouth open and a huge grin on his face as he waits for Jake to comment)

Jake: (Looking defeated) You know how most people have at least one redeeming quality? (Amir nods his head loosely) Well you dont. Okay, you just dont. You took a beloved childhood character say that youre riding it and then dont even have the common decency to get that characters name right? Just stop. Youre bad.

(Amir sighs loudly, looks defeated, takes his seat and brings his laptop out sitting Cookie monster to the side of it so it looks at Jake)
Jake: Really? That was it? All I had to say was that to get you to start working? By the way I have told you these things numerous times. Id say at least once a week for the past 7 years.
(While Jake has been talking Amir has been typing)

Amir: I just sent something to the printer could you go get it for me? I have no shoes on.
Jake: (Taken aback) Weird reason why you cant go to the printer, youre inside. But okay because its the first normal thing youd asked of me since Ive met you.
(As Jake walks away Amir stares at him with his eyes narrowed. Jake arrives at the printer and is horrified to see that out of the paper tray an already rolled up and wax stamped scroll has come out. Jake looks back at Amir)

Jake: How?! How do you print out a scroll? Let alone have it rolled up and stamped for you?

(Amir puts his hand out to Jake)

Amir: The scroll please, you troll.
Jake: No! Not if youre going to call me a troll! Youre the tro-

(Suddenly Jake doesnt have the scroll and it is in Amirs hands)

Amir: (proudly declaring) Top 10 sneakers to wear by Amir Jakery Blumenfieldwhizz

(Jake takes his seat back at his desk and looks on at Amir, surrendering himself to what is about to happen)

Amir: Number 10, I know a lizard named Glen. He came frown the sewer and I did know fewer-

Jake: (Interrupting) Fewer? Fewer what? Fewer lizards? Also you sound like you know a lot about this lizard. Why are you friends with it?
Amir: (Continuing) But then Glen become a bit too big for his boots so I shot him with a moose. (Amir chuckles to himself)

Jake: So when you said fewer you did mean fewer lizards which is just a weird thing to say. What do you mean too big for his boots? You tell me these stories with nothing to base it upon. No backstory no nothing and how do you shoot someone with a moose?

Amir: (Continuing still chuckling) and then I wore him on my caboose! (As he says this he puts his feet on the desk showing his bare feet)

Jake: You mean feet! And no youre not. There is nothing on your caboose. Cmon buddy. You havent made this little sense in ages.

Amir: Number 9. Oh. What. Is. The. Time?

Jake: Stop pausing in between words. This doesnt have to take as long as you think it should.
Amir: (excitedly) I say its time for crime! I got me and my cowboys together for a rodeo where we got some whores and bought some (waiting for a response but doesnt wait long enough) blow!

Jake: (Mouth ajar and hands in the air) I dont get it. I dont know what to do. You got your cowboys together? What? Do you ever self examine? Do you ever think about what youre going to say? And if this is all true then you live a deprived sad little life. Bud, I want to feel sorry for you but I cant.
Amir: Let me answer your question with a question Jakey. What do you think Number 8 is? Yeah thats right dont be late! Put your Air Jordans on and get some Pear Gordons, Ron! We got a plane to catch let me just fix up this sweater patch. (Pulls out a sweater with a patch on it)

Jake: Why? Why have you got that? To make that rhyme? And well done it took you two attempts to even put a brand of shoe on your Top 10 Sneakers to wear list.

Amir: Number 5
Jake: Wrong

Amir: Sneakers to jive. Chocolate covered and full of peanuts thats what we get when we wipe our butts. (He says this as he puts his hand up his asscrack and brings out a lump of his own shit)

Jake: (looking like he will be sick) Oh my god! Why? Why have you just pulled out shit from your asshole? In the office? Thats not okay! Thats not fine!

(Amir is giving the shit to Cookie Monster as he tries to put it in his hand)

Amir: Well then

Jake: No! Not well then! Wash your hands!

Amir: Number 2

Jake: Wrong Number! Wash your hands!

Amir: The Cookie has poo.

Jake: (Shaking his head) How dare you! How dare you actually look like youre doing work and then do a full 180! Not even a 180! A 270! You planned all of it! You planned actually looking like you did work and then planned to pull shit out of your ass! What the fuck is wrong with you?

Amir: And the cookie becomes then a poo shoe. 
(A long pause occurs)

Amir: Number 1. Fun in the sun. A vacation is what the doctor ordered.

(Amir rolls back up the scroll)

Jake: What the fuck man? What did I just hear? On your top 10 list of sneakers to wear list you only had 6 entries. With a lot of effort gone into the first 3 and no effort in the last 3. In fact Im pretty sure you copied youre Number 1 from a previous scroll and you havent even commented on the shit thing.
Amir: (Stares with his hands together looking at Jake and appearing to take in his every word) Youre a poet Jake. A god damn 55% poet. (Amir goes back to typing) Could you get something from the printer for me?

(Jake accepts as he cant see it getting any worse, a piece of paper with the words C is for Cookie and cookies are for shit on it. Then runny shit spurts from out the printer. Closing the episode)

<DATE> 2015-01-27 12:54:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When I got a Wii U this game was on the top of my list. In fact I went out and got the game the very same day. Mario Kart 8 topping many "Best game of 2014 lists" and being advertised as that on the Nintendo eShop. It was fair to say that expectations were high I love all of the other Mario Karts and this one should be the best one yet. Right? I'm sorry to say that I found the game just a tad on the disappointing side.

For me the tracks were just not as good as the other games tracks, I say this because I can't really remember them. I could tell you my favourite tracks in MK Wii or DS but with 8 I just cant remember any of them. For lack of a better example I felt that in this game, the game that introduces anti gravity in the series they could have done an amazing Rainbow Road. But alas it wasn't as spectacular as the other ones. In fact I prefer playing the Retro Rainbow Road in this game than the new one.

I'm also not completely down to clown with the whole anti grav thing, it's fun the first time you do it but sometimes I just feel it's a bit too gimmicky and would have preferred some "normal flat tracks".

However it's not all doom and gloom, the production value is amazing and a fully HD Mario Kart was always going to be a joy to look at. Also having alot of fun with the online mode!

Does anyone else not get the hype behind this game? Or am I alone?

Edit: Also the character roster is a complete and utter joke. 4 Baby characters?! Pink Gold Peach? What?!

TL;DR : MK8 dissapointed me, it feel gimmicky in places and unmemorable. Does anyone else feel that way? Or is the genrael opinion that it's amazing? </TEXT>

However I have heard for years that Mario Galaxy 2 is the better game... and I don't get why. For me both games feel exactly the same with the intro being near enough identical other than it being set in a book the 2nd time round! Am I alone in this thoughts? Thanks! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello all just stumbled into this sub here and thought I'd ask a question. I love Lego. As a product it's fantastic and I spent many hours of my childhood building. To be honest I'd like to get that back, my only problem is money. To be honest again alot of the Lego sets I have seen are very *very* expensive and can't justify to my parents (I still live at home) spending that much money on a "childrens toy". 

How can I justify my new found hobby when approached? And what sets etc should I start out with? 

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello folks. I hope you have had a good Christmas holiday. First this is a confession. I have confessed to those I am accountable with, however I love this community so thought it would be best confessing here to. So for a few months I have been hitting it off with this girl. She's great, I'm attracted to her and her theology is on point. We have alot in common and she often comes to me for advice etc. Last month I told her I liked her and she said she would pray about it as she wanted this to line up with God's will. Great! Sounds like my kind of girl. However it's been over a month now and we havent bought it up once. She texts me every morning without fail and we talk every day to. We meet one and one and just talk about Jesus but never what our relationship is. Recently I have seen her like her exes pictures on Instagram and Facebook. He's a Christian to so whenever he posts a bible verse she likes it and vice versa. They seem to talk on Twitter and over comments on Facebook. This has turned me into someone quite obsessive. On the Facebook app you can see when someone was last online and I keep checking to see when they're both online and when they are instantly get jealous. I check their Twitters and other social networking to. As I've been at home all Christmas my days have been spent like this. I have no evidence that they like each other in anyway other than comments and Tweets I've seen and from what I can gather she does like me and if she doesnt then I feel shes been leading me on. I need peace in this situation as I'm having sleepless nights thinking about it.

Thank you all!

TL;DR - I like a girl and when I see her ex like her Social Media posts and vice versa I get angry. This has led me to stalk both their online lives. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Didn't know how to describe this in the title. Basically I have liked this girl for 5 years and the other month I told her I liked her. She giggled and said she didn't know how she felt she'd give it time. Since then she pretty much gets me everyday. However because of my anxiety I think she may like another guy because she likes his Instagram and Facebook posts quite regularly. 

I know this is all a bit silly and I'm probably over reacting but what do I do? This is making me lose sleep.

Thanks for understanding. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dont get me wrong I love Game Grumps and I love content but I personally think we're a bit spoilt really. I cannot think of another channel that posts 3 episodes a day. That's insane. No wonder half of you think Game Grumps is declining in quality.

The practical reason for this thought is that I really want to watch through the Sunshine series again while keeping up to date with the Sonic Boom, Katamari and DKC episodes. Man it's a lot of time to spend watching games each day.

Maybe Monday, Wednesday and Friday could be video days and prehaps a One Off or VS on Sat and Sunday. I think if these was adopted people wouldnt complain about lack of quality in the show and we would have more days to catch up.

Just a thought. </TEXT>

I'm going to playing the game single player, first and have matches with my friends of course. But as I want to start a new hobby I thought I'd go and do For Glory matches alot and possibly get competitive. This is a man who played Brawl as his first Smash game and loved it but never played competitively.

What do I need to know?

Edit: I mained DK in Brawl and will most certainly main him here to. </TEXT>

Also just the blatant fact that Arin doesnt know where he's going anymore. In some regards thats the games fault but I have it and it's not as bad as they make out. </TEXT>

Edit: with the old cable it DID work once but the cable died in my care (it was battered) so there is hope.

<TEXT> Hello all. My dad (60) recently got a tablet for his birthday and as doing so also signed up for Facebook. I helped him sign up at that time there was no phone numbers in the house that could be verified with his account so we skipped that part. Due to privacy settings Facebook signs you out of the app every month or so, however my dad cannot get back into the app without ID. The app is asking for a picture of at least two forms of ID. He no longer has his birth certificate, he doesnt drive and has never been abroad. I come here asking for help, is there a way to revert back to using a mobile number as ID? It's not giving us the option. Or is there a way to contact Facebook and discuss the problem?

Thank you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is an update from this:https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/2n90bn/brought_a_nintendo_64_in_a_drunkdepressed_state/

So my Nintendo 64 came and I was naturally very excited. I set it up and hooked everything up but I cannot find the blasted thing on my TV. I have two options and that is either to plug the AV Composite cables into the TV itself or put them into a SCART head and do it that way. However I have tried both and the problem persists. I have dug abit online and it does seem like a common problem without a common fix. Some people have had to buy upscalers etc, I'd rather not do that because of being tight with money at the moment. To try and be as helpful as possible my TV is a Toshiba 40BL702B. Anyway thanks in advance for any help! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So recently I have seen posts about "Grumpcade" and what it actually is. I have a few questions regarding what the show is/ confirmed to be?

1.I heard that in the same vein as Steam Train being any combo of Grumps playing PC Games that Grumpcade will be any combo playing console games. Is this true? If so then what will be the point in Game Grumps?

2. I also heard it would be for 4 player console games. Again isn't this what Steam Rolled is?

If anyone can explain what Grumpcade is meant to be I will be grateful!  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This post is just another thank you to the Grumps. With all the negativity in this sub I thought this would be a welcome change. Here's my story.

This week I have been basically diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety, this is fine every other day of the week because I have work and it takes my mind off it. However on Sundays I don't do anything from 1 in the afternoon and my mind starts to wander and get sad. However yesterday I decided to go on a "Grumps Spree" and dear me. Did it cheer me up and to end my day the new parts of DKC and Sonic Boom.

I'm aware the Grumps cannot cure my problems and I am not relying on them to do that as after all they are just a web show. But for a few hours at least I can be depressed with a smile. </TEXT>

Prayer over this would be massively appreciated. Please PM me if you have any questions or anything to say.

<TEXT> I'm not here for advice on which phone to get, I have decided to get the iPhone 5c because at the moment it has the best deal for me. What I want to do with it is phone, text, use Facebook, Twitter, Install a few low graphically demanding games, a few news apps, email and search the web. I have heard reports of the phone not lasting the two years I will have it on contract for, so other than the advice "Get a better phone" how can I maintain my phone and apps so that in 2 years I can say goodbye to it not dissapointed.

Thank you all.

*Edit for clarity*: I have never had an iPhone before and my last phone was a Blackberry the one before that was a Nokia Lumina.

TL:DR - Getting a 5c for low maintenance use how is the best way I can use it so that I am happy for the next two years? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Prayer Needed - I love porn too much </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-28 12:15:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello all, Recently I felt God has been trying to help me break away from my porn and masturbation addiction. 

**A little background information about my struggle**

I've been chronically masturbating for about 5 years, everyday, many times a day. I've tried on and off to stop doing it to no avail. I realised recently I can't keep going on like this. It's rewiring my mind, taking up time and recently has eaten up finances. I know about the sub r/nofap and r/nofapchristians and if that is the community you need right now I highly recommend them.

For me personally being in a community talking about masturbation made me feel guilty and not convicted by the spirit. I need to stop though and I know it. I need the wider church to pray for me because I just cannot do this anymore. I dont have the willpower or strength to do it because in the moment it's enjoyable. I want that to change. For Christ.

TL;DR I masturbate alot. Pray for me to stop. </TEXT>

Do you think in some of these circumstances that these groups idolise women and not God? </TEXT>

If stuck for an answer follow this guideline..

Does it have to rhyme? How long does it have to be? Any other genrael advice?

Thanks so much! And have a great day! </TEXT>

After he threatened a child he was asked to leave. Even though this happened months ago I am still shook up and dont feel I can go anywhere without bumping into him.

<TITLE> Change my view - When Jesus died he didn't stop being the Son of God. But he did go to "Hell" </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-10 18:06:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For a while now I have believed this but after doing some research in this sub it doesn't seem a popular view point. I will explain why I believe this first so you can see where I am coming from.

The penalty of sin was death. Jesus had mankind's sin put on his shoulders. Meaning on that cross he was sinful, he took what we should have. Which is death, death not being a earthly death but a separation from God. (AKA Hell) That's what we deserve. Everyone dies. He didn't die to stop us from dying on earth, he died to not allow us to be separated from God but someone needed to... Namely Jesus.

New Living Translation
For as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.

The heart of the earth could just be the ground, but I see it as Sin. The heart of our world since the fall is separation from God.


The idea of Christ being separated from God is more beautiful to me than him dying an earthly death. It should never have happened.

Now go tell me where I am wrong.

But man sometimes when I am at my lowest (like now) I just cant hack it. I need to be joyful with God and intimate with him. Please pray.

<TITLE> Joy of God. Not getting it. Prayer? </TITLE>

<TEXT> For the past 4 years (My whole christian life) I have struggled with wanting a girlfriend/wife. Its something Ive always strived for even before I was a Christian. Its a struggle because some days I put it above God. I put wanting someone to share God with above God which is ridiculous. I also fail to understand or feel joy in God, I mean he saved me great! But thats about it. 

Please pray for me to find joy within God and God only. Cheers! </TEXT>

If you dont know would it be an appropriate thing to ask at my interview next week?

**Episode** Homers Triple Bypass - So many great jokes and a great excecution for such a serious ep.

**Joke** - (While watching a glowing Homer behind an X-ray)
Dr. Hibbert: Now Mrs. Simpson, what you see here is the radioactive dye we injected into your husband's bloodstream.
Nurse: But doctor! I haven't injected the dye yet!
Dr. Hibbert: Good Lord! </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Hangover Trilogy - What do you think? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-28 23:48:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I've just watched the 3rd Hangover film, and I have a lot of thoughts running through my head so thought I'd share here what I thought about all the films in arguably one of the most mixed film series I've ever seen.

The Hangover : Probably one of my favorite comedies of all time or its at least definatley up there. I thought the whole film was fantastic, the idea of a mystery combined with comedy was great and of course the characters were probably theglue that kept it all together.

Part 2: The same exact film. Is that bad? Depends. I enjoyed it but the films ending was less satisfying than the first as it is the same thing as before.

Part 3: I have no idea how I feel about it... When did they turn into action heroes? It just seems really out of place most of the time, oh and I didn't laugh really. It was a great set up but this really felt flat I think. Doesn't really feel like a Hangover film...

I'm sure my opinions may change after rewatches though :)

What are your opinions? </TEXT>

<TEXT> As stated in Part 1 of Journey to Sillius when Dan asks if Ross' proposal is too personal even though Arin said it was up to Ross it seemed that before starting Grumps Arin told both Dan and Ross to not speak of their personal lives as thatd be the only reason Dan would really ask. So lovelies good or bad thing? The reason I loved Grumps before was how personal Jon and Arin got but now its a different sort of show I dont mind.

<TEXT> So I have been questioning the existence of the Christian God, but there are a few things that are hard for me to look over. Such as about a year ago a elderly man came up to me and told me God told him what was going on in my life and sure enough he told me every detail. However he told me things I hadnt told people such as self harming etc. God told him to tell me that God loves me and I should stop doing it. How would you explain that without faith? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am a 18 year old Christian and I think I'll still call myself that for a while.. However my faith is dwindling I feel controlled by the church so much that I dont even care if God exists anymore I just want MY life back. Anyhoo for some reason its decided I should get baptised after 4 years of going to church, part of that is a testimoney in front of the church saying all the great things God has done and the other is to accept Jesus into my life. I dont feel like lying to all these people, or really telling them i dont want to do it as they need 3 people to do it and Im the third... should I just go along with it or what?

Also its in 5 days... </TEXT>
