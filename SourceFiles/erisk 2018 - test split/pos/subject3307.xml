<TEXT> I'm very sorry this has happened to you, OP. I went through pretty much the same situation. The only difference is that we were married and had two babies, 2 yo   2 mos. Also, she didn't notify me, but I discovered it on my own.

A lot has happened in the 8 years since, but that was one of the hardest things I've ever had to go through. I completely understand your pain and if you need to talk, I'm here for you.

Take care of yourself right now and if you can help it, try not to isolate yourself and make arrangements for a friend or family member to stay with you for a week or three. Unfortunately, time is the only thing that will heal the pain, however loving support gets you through it all.

Edit: 
I'd also like to add that the only reason Kate revealed herself is because she's selfish as fuck. She didn't notify you because she felt bad about what she did, she did it because she realized that since she couldn't have him that you shouldn't either. IMO, the only possible way to show remorse for being the other woman, especially for 5 YEARS, is to quietly walk away from the asshole and disappear into oblivion. I understand that some of you may say that OP deserves to know and you are absolutely correct. However, having been in this situation, I think I would have rather avoided the pain of knowing my SO had a lengthy relationship with someone else, than to have just maybe caught him cheating on a more casual scale because it would have eventually come out regardless. Cheaters will always be cheaters, so I can say with almost 100% certainty that you and Kate weren't the only ones.
TL;DR: Kate's a selfish bitch that's just bitter that she didn't get the so-called "prize". </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been able to manage my depression quite well using trees. The suicidal thoughts are pretty much gone which is a huge relief. 

The negative is that I tend to get lazy. Also, I don't have much of an appetite unless I'm high. That can be considered both good and bad, depending on how you look at it.

I'm sure it would be easier to manage in general if I were able to buy legally, but I take whatever I can get so I usually don't get the option of choosing a strain that would work best for me. I really need to work on getting a prescription...

Off topic but I'm going crazy and need to vent: I'm stuck at my dad's for a week to help take care of him (he's disabled) and only have some  low grade brown stuff. I can't wait until my gf gets here tomorrow night! She's bringing some green!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Find a lactation consultant and/or a breastfeeding support group NOW! I went through the same thing your wife is going through. I wanted to succeed at bfing so bad but I began to resent my son for being hungry because it was sooooo painful feeding him and I was as close to quitting as I could get. My friend recommended I try the hospital support group and I got the help I so desperately needed. I'm so glad I was able to get help and save my bfing experience.

Tell her to hang in there just a little bit longer and find some help asap. It's so worth it.

<TITLE> [CA] My mother has been displaced from her house due to a restraining order from her wife. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-07 19:36:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm at work so I'll try to make this brief. My mother got into a physical altercation with her wife [C]. Police were called and arrested my mom because C had "scratches and bruises" on her allegedly inflicted by my mom. C has preexisting medical conditions that she used to her advantage.

As of today, due to the restraining order, my mom is displaced from her house, which she has had ownership of since 1984. The house is currently in a living trust, of which C has no rights to as far as I know. We went with the police yesterday afternoon on a civil standby to collect some personal belongings and my mom noticed there are several boxes packed in the house. I also want to add that C requested that the police allow her to inspect the personal belongings my mom packed to be sure no community property was being taken, which they allowed her to do.

What can we do to protect what is currently in the home so that C doesn't remove any property from the house? My mom has a criminal defense lawyer, but still needs to find a divorce lawyer. She wants to wait to find a divorce lawyer until this afternoon after she meets with her defense lawyer, but I feel like something needs to be done immediately. C is vindictive and I wouldn't put anything past her at this point. She tried to refuse my mother entry to the home even with police escort, so who knows what she's capable of. I have notified the neighbors of the situation and asked them to contact one of us if they notice property being removed from the home.

Is there some type of document that can be filed (maybe something I can do myself??) with the court to prevent the removal of any property from the house? My mom has spent a ton of money on this so far and is trying to avoid having to pay a lot more, but I feel at this point she needs to pony up so she doesn't lose more in the long run. I'm not quite sure my mom realizes how serious this is and I'm trying to reduce her potential loss as much as I can.

Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated. Thank you so much in advance.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> He called me two times earlier this evening on my cell but I didn't feel like talking so I didn't answer. He finally called my house and I answered.

It's prostate cancer. He used the word "advanced" and said something about it being in 12 different places. I was pretty hysterical so I couldn't focus on getting more info.

I feel like a piece of shit for ignoring his phone call. I hate myself for not wanting to talk to him. I don't know how I'm going to deal with this. I'm a wreck.

Things between us have been strained lately, mostly on my end because of his inability to understand the fact that I'm in a same sex relationship. I feel like an asshole now. 

I'm so scared. I already have depression issues that I've been managing quite well lately. If I lose my dad, I'm going to lose my mind.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The last time I talked to her was a few weeks ago right before I went to Las Vegas. Things were fine on the phone and I had no inclination that anything was wrong.

I tried calling her several times and she didn't answer which was unusual for her. I got a little worried because she's been having a tough time, so I contacted her friend on Facebook to ask if she was okay (she deleted her Facebook).

Later that day she sent me a nasty text. "Dude, quit calling me and asking people about me. When I want to talk to you I'll call you." This totally came out of nowhere and I don't know whether to ask her what's wrong or just let it go. I miss her.
  
**tl;dr**: Should I contact her to see why she's mad or leave her alone? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Who works 7 days a week and doesn't have enough money to pay a decent wage? I'm a single mother and neglected to mention that someone in that area may be interested. It would require very little effort on their part, especially if their child is going to the same school. Of course if that were the case, I would get him ready myself. The area is upscale so most mothers don't work and I'm sure they'd enjoy some spare change. 

No need to be snarky about my request. Thanks for your unhelpful comment. I was very aware of the hourly wage.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry for not responding sooner... I'm not on all those meds anymore. I'm only on 4 now. Lamotrigine (500 mg), Paxil (10 mg), Saphris (1.25 mg), and Abilify (4 mg). When I was on the 9 I stopped cold turkey because I couldn't stand it anymore and it wasn't helping. Bad idea, I know. I had seen several different Drs that year, so they just kept adding and adding. I didn't know which way was up anymore.

<TEXT> Just a warning, this may seem to jump all over the place. I apologize in advance.

I had a breakdown in January 2011 and ended up being in the hospital 3 times that year. 2012 got a little better as I was finally able to figure out a medication combo that worked for me. I still wasn't feeling like I could work, but finally in September an opportunity arose that I couldn't pass up.

Well, that opportunity has now ended. The business was really slow so they had to let a few people go. Here it is, a new year, and 4 days from the two-year anniversary of my breakdown. I really don't want it to happen again, but I'm not so sure I can be strong.

I guess everything happens for a reason because since I've been working, I've been really bad about helping my son with his homework and turning it in on time. Now that I don't work, I will have more time to devote to that. I feel like a terrible mother because in spite of knowing that my son is at risk for retention of first grade, I haven't been able to get my act together and get on top of his homework. It's just such a battle getting him to do it and I just don't have the energy to argue with him.

My ex-husband also dropped on me today that he wants to claim our younger son on taxes this year. He owes me thousands of dollars, doesn't follow our divorce agreement of 50/50, and doesn't pay any child support. He thinks just because he has the younger one 3 days a week and both every other weekend, and buys them clothes that he deserves one for taxes. The best part: He isn't even LEGAL! I checked the law, and it is in my favor, but this causes a rift between us and the last thing I need is to be fighting with him about stupid shit. Don't ask me how he can file taxes because I have no clue. But, he does it. Who knows.

That's my rant/story. Thank you for reading.

<TEXT> Well, it wasn't my job, but it was someone else's and I was on the receiving end of the "care". My dad had a small manufacturing shop with a secretary and about 6-7 guys working the machines. For reasons I won't go into, I was staying with him in a 5th wheel on the property because I was arguing with my mom. 

I had just had to terminate a pregnancy that morning and went into the office to use the phone (pre-cell phone era) to order a pizza. Well, on my way back out I fainted in the hallway. My dad's secretary had to help me to the toilet, change my pad for me, and then one of the guys had to carry me back to the trailer.

Not my finest moment. The bright side was that she had known me since I was a little girl so there was some familiarity there. I'm still angry at my mom for making me stay with my dad instead of being at home where I could have passed out on the bathroom floor.

TL;DR: Had an abortion, dad's secretary changed my bloody pad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain by having him evaluated by early intervention services. If anything, it will give you peace of mind.

When my son had his 18 month check-up, his Dr. asked if he was saying any words, making sounds, etc. He had NO vocabulary whatsoever, not mama, dada, etc. He did babble occasionally, but it was incoherent and at that age that's not considered normal. His Dr. shrugged it off and sent us on our way. However, a week later she called me and told me she had been thinking about it and she wanted him to be evaluated. He began speech therapy 1 hr/week at 23 months. The first session the therapist worked with him to get him to say "pop" while playing with bubbles.

He will be 7 in March and is still in speech therapy at school. He speaks normally for the most part, but he still has difficulty translating his thoughts into words, i.e. he knows what he wants to say, but can't quite figure out how to get it out.

This may or may not have something to do with his father leaving. I'm pretty sure the assistance you find will be able to provide a more definitive answer for you, although, I think it may be difficult to determine any cause. </TEXT>

Is it crazy that in a way I wish it would come back as cancer? I've always somewhat fantasized about having cancer because that wouldn't give me a choice as to whether I lived or died. It just seems so much easier since I'm actually a coward and too afraid to end it myself.

I was doing so, so great up until the past week or so. I'm determined to dig myself out of this rut before it turns into a full-blown relapse.

Thanks for listening. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Back in June, I was contacted by a staffing agency about a position with a large healthcare company. Long story short, it didn't work out but I wasn't too upset because it was a 100 mile commute. 

Right after, another position opened very close to home and they asked if I would be interested. I said I was, and they proceeded to set up a phone interview which went great. At the end of the call, the supervisor said I had passed the phone screen and they would call me for a face-to-face interview. I didn't hear anything for a week or two until the staffing agency called to tell me that although their client is very interested in me, they are on a hiring freeze which they expected to be over the beginning of August. Okay, that's fine...

Finally, the week before last I get a call saying that unfortunately they are still on the freeze, however the client would like to extend a verbal offer because they expect the freeze to be over the following week. Great news! I'm excited because I really want this job and it's kinda cool because I didn't even have to go in for an interview.

Fast forward to this week. The original agent I was working with transitioned to a new role and another took over. Over the course of this week, I filled out all of the paperwork, took the drug test, background check, online training courses, etc. This morning I received a call from the agency telling me that the client decided that the position requires an Associate's Degree!!!

Why on earth did they make me go through all that crap knowing from the beginning that I didn't have an AA? I know they have every right to change their mind; it just REALLY pisses me off!!!

Question: I'm thinking about contacting the original agent about the whole situation and seeing if she can find out what happened. I have also thought about calling the person I interviewed with over the phone to see if he can do/tell me anything. I have a hard time believing they just changed their education requirement at the last minute. Any thoughts? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Me too!! I thought I was the only one who felt like this. Calling people by their names just feels weird to me. I will do it to get their attention in a situation where there is no way they would know I was talking to them otherwise, but other than that I pretty much can't do it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He's my congressman, too! I emailed him regarding SOPA and this was his response:

"While I believe that those who violate copyright laws should be held accountable for their actions, I am concerned that this legislation also violates the free speech and due process rights of content producers and Internet consumers.  As it is currently written, SOPA enables law enforcement to target all sites that contain some infringing content (no matter how small), and those who "facilitate" infringing content.  This is comparable to taking down all of Facebook because someone posts a copyright-protected video to his or her profile.  Furthermore, a copyright holder could issue an order to have a website seized without seeking court approval. 

Until actions are taken by SOPA's authors to ensure that this bill does not infringe upon basic civil liberties, I cannot support it."

Love this guy!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got a 6-pack of VHS tapes from my aunt. I subsequently made a "video" with my then boyfriend, which was found by his aunt and uncle. I was 15. Worst gift EVER! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand you were posting your experience. However, I still don't understand how what you described could have been so traumatic for you. It sounds like the hospital ran some tests and placed you in a room until you could be evaluated by a doctor.

I felt so bad for the people who were staying behind. I had been there for one night; what had they been through staying there for days? I wouldn't have wished that place on my worst enemies.

Who are YOU to judge that that hospital was so bad and their experiences were just as traumatic as yours?

all I wanted was help to get back on track with my classes, and I got locked up like a crazy person.

You got "locked up" because you told your counselor you were feeling suicidal. The counselor took you to the hospital because she was afraid of what you yourself admitted to thinking of doing. And not all people that spend time in a hospital for psychiatric reasons are "crazy" people.

And I take personal offense with your use of the term "loonie bin". It is because of people like you and your use of derogatory terms, i.e. "crazy person" and "loonie bin" that mental illness has a negative stigma associated with it.

<TEXT> I really think you are doing a disservice to other people struggling with depression and in need of serious help, i.e. hospitalization. Your experience doesn't sound terrible at all; it's right on par with what happens when you are committed to a mental hospital.

Time to put on your big girl panties and stop being a drama queen about it. There are tons of other people that have and will get great results from being in the hospital for a few days or more. Shame on you for portraying it as "the worst experience" of your life and scaring others away from possibly getting the treatment that can save their lives! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't feel like the meds were working. What's the point of taking them if they aren't going to do what they're supposed to?

I feel almost exactly the same as I did while on meds, except for the fact that I feel terrible physically as well as mentally/emotionally. I also am sleeping a lot more than I did with the meds, but I think that just has to do with my physical state. (I was on 450mg of Effexor.) </TEXT>
