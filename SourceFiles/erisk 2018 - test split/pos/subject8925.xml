<TEXT> Well, there was a girl named Agatha who was more fucked up than I was. Drug addict, prostitute, abusive mother, etc. Then there was a couple named Fishe   Ari. They were...actually sort of boring. I honestly think they were created just because I was lonely and scared, nothing more than that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've always thought that was clever of my psychosis, a real excellent way to protect itself from logical outsiders.

I mentioned this just now in another comment thread: I found out my senior year of high school, years after I had seen any of them last. Talking about it with my therapist quickly unraveled them. It shook me up real badly for the better part of a year. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mentioned something like this earlier: I was on sertraline and seroquil every day for four months, stopped taking them because they didn't seem to work very well. They just sort of made me sleepy and lethargic. I don't trust myself to self-medicate, I don't know what'll trigger a psychotic break and the risk is too high for me.

I think of my crazy as a genetic thing - my dad's pretty crazy, which is great cause he understands me. I wasn't raised in a wholly chaotic household, both my parents loved me very much, I wasn't subjected to any sort of religious indoctrination... </TEXT>

I actually did that with my friend (the one whose place I'm at), sat with him in the waiting room while he filled out intake forms. It's really hard admitting you need help, having someone you trust to not judge you is incredibly helpful. </TEXT>

I'm very distrustful of new people and new situations, I try and have someone I know is real - my brother, or an old friend - meet new people I like, just in case. </TEXT>

**Friend here. I can vouch for this. ;)**

No, really. When I was younger I was fucking because of my psychosis, I was... converting? through sex. That's a good way to put it. At this point I fuck because of and in spite of my crazy. I can only get interested in someone sexually if they're at least somewhat neurotic. Mental illness is sexy.

Also I love "psycho-sex". I'm going to use that in the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I meant AMA, don't even worry.

I no longer have manic episodes, so yes, I am not bipolar. I went through intense therapy for two years to calm my mania. I miss it, sometimes.

Starting at the age of nine, I became convinced that God was talking to me, and that my family was demonically possessed. I would have periods of violence and attempt to hurt my parents and my little brother to exorcise them. When I was 12, I swallowed half a bottle of Tylenol in an attempt to join God in heaven. My father, who is bipolar himself, enrolled me in therapy. </TEXT>
