<TEXT> If we are to judge business by Open and Click Through rate of its newsletters, I guess it's safe to say business is good. As far as having inventory goes... a different story. 

How did I get into Freemason ties? I joined the Freemasons between 2007-2008. I was a callcenter agent by day, and graphics artist / web designer by night with baby number 2 on the way. I wasn't a tie guy but the masons like to meet in suit and tie so I was forced to buy one. I searched online looking for a Masonic tie but everything that was available at the time were tacky and loud looking (keep in mind Freemasonry is supposed to be about subtlety). My wife thought it would be cool if I could just make one for myself- so I made a pattern in Photoshop and had someone overseas made the tie for me. The manufacturer sent me two ties instead of one. I kept one for myself and auctioned the other one on eBay (sold for $70+). Reinvested the funds, rest was history.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My method is synchronicity. I might not be able to help you with the christening but I'll share you how I got mine. "FraternalTies" is my business name and my tagline is "The tie that binds."

Please indulge me.

I'm in the business of designing and selling fashion accessories for the members of the oldest fraternal organization in the world- the Freemasons. My main product is the [necktie](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/5xi94y/i_saw_the_location_vs_picture_in_rfunny_and_it/). But I also design [shoes](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/0152/t/2/assets/slideshow_4.jpg?6889911725727113096), [watches](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/0152/products/Wooden_Masonic_Watch_V2_copy_large.jpg?v=1423682345), [Handcarved box](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/0152/files/FraternalTies_Masonic_Wooden_Box_eye_of_providence_2_b_51416fcf-f8f1-4d66-9956-60045953ceeb_1024x1024.jpg?7096394448000122269), etc. 

I first encountered the term "fraternal ties" as a [DeMolay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeMolay_International) (youth organization for young men ages 12-21) back in the Philippines listening to speeches delivered by Freemasons. I have always liked the way it sounds. I love it when heads of countries the term "fraternal ties" to describe their relationship. 

Around 2008 I joined the Freemasons, realized I needed a tie (wasn't a tie person prior), searched online for a Masonic tie and all that's available are loud and tacky, the idea to just make my own tie came up, I thought that my favorite term "fraternal ties" will sound great as a tie brand for a fraternal organization, checked online and found out that fraternalties.com was available, and the rest = history YAY!

As entrepreneurs, I like to think that the products and services that we promote are extensions of ourselves. With that in mind, I'd say that the best name that we can give our business is a name or idea that will describe the essence of what we're trying to do. Only the individual entrepreneur can discover that name for him/herself. #knowthyself

<TEXT> I'm feeling quite bummed to be honest... I was avoiding this issue because it could trigger an anxiety attack in me but I checked earlier and I found out that so far they have only removed 2 designs- those 2 are the ties I designed for very exclusive sub-groups within Freemasonry. 

For one they are [still selling](https://www.uniqueregalia.co.uk/collections/masonic-ties/products/copy-of-masonic-regalia-freemason-tie-with-square-compass-blue-new-design) my flagship necktie, [the memento mori](http://www.fraternalties.com/collections/classic-collection/products/memento-mori-masonic-tie). We had 5 major deaths in the family and that necktie (tears with the memento mori symbol on back) is a reminder personally to me of how fragile life is. I part of me feels really bitter that they won't stop selling my work despite many appeals from myself and my supporters. But also a part of me is feeling proud for having such loyal customers who would fight for the brand without expecting anything in return.  </TEXT>

I strive to get this right during photography so that way I don't have to spend time correcting stuff in Photoshop.

<TEXT> The regular necktie length is 57". I'm not even tall (just 5"8' on a good day) but I was overweight and had a fat neck when I began with the business and I found out that I can't make extra fancy knots with a 57" tie. That's why all our neckties begin at 60". [I have lost weight since](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4bau2q/is_it_too_late_to_get_in_shape_i_thought_so_but/) but I kept it at 60" for superior knots.

<TEXT> I appreciate your comment Brother. Exact copies. I made the designs from scratch and have the sketches, versions, pretty much the evolution of the designs I have them. Not only that. 2 designs are made exclusively for members only Masonic groups such as the College of Freemasonry in Ontario, Canada and Arabian-Milo Lodge No. 882. Those ties that they have copied as is are not meant to be for sale to anyone outside of their own groups.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello there sire!, your headline caught my beautiful eagle-eyed wife's attention. We have a small family business. We like to call ourselves the original [6 from the6ix](https://www.instagram.com/fraternalties/). lol. We recently invented on a DYMO LabelWriter 4XL. It's the best investment that we've ever made, only next to when we upgraded from wordpress to shopify back in 2010. We will check your website out. Thanks!

<TEXT> Kumusta kapatid! I'm a 36yr old father of 4. I began smoking cigarettes when I was 14, a meth addict in college, was on Lipitor before I was 30, I used to suffer from severe sleep apnea and was so unhealthy I had to sleep with a CPAP mask to help me breath at night. To top all that, I was also diagnosed with severe social anxiety and PTSD.

I never played sports my entire life but when my kids signed up for muaythai not too long ago, I decided to follow (October 2015 to be precise) and I was hooked. [My story here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MuayThai/comments/5c9alm/for_those_wondering_if_its_too_late_to_begin_muay/). I'm sharing this here as proof that the past abuses that we put our body through shall not hold us back if the mind and body is willing to move forward and leave the past. How to gain lost stamina and endurance? The answer is already in you. Like anything in life, you get what you put in it. So train hard and get it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for your post! We've been selling to UK since 2010 but there's not always enough inventory to go around. I actually found out about the infringement from my longtime customer from UK who happened to buy an apron from them. He noticed that one of the ties on sale looks exactly like ours and he notified me. But yeah, on my "contact us" page there's a dropdown menu where people can select "testimonial", "inquiry", or "complaint"- the usual complaint that I get is that our products don't stay long enough on shelf. Sold out usually within hours. Good business problem to have I suppose... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Man, if you follow that logic, how do you explain designers who use the cross? Or other important ancient symbols for that matter? Do they own those symbols? Did I ever claim owning the S C? I don't appreciate your comment at all. I find it highly offensive. I don't just use the S C and make money of it. I contemplate on it and I spend countless hours making patterns that compliment our Badge. Freemasonry is near and dear to me. I credit it for saving my sanity and my life so I surround myself with it. Don't question me about my motive because ultimately I'm just trying to feed my family. Sincere best wishes? What is your motive for saying what you said? Encourage industry, reward merit- lessons from the Second Degree. Keep that in mind.

<TEXT> I appreciate your comment. I have a tendency to take like a hundred photos and pick just one. My wife used to hate it but I think now she understands. I have severe social anxiety that prevents me from doing what other business owners consider mundane (like checking email, picking up the phone, talking to potential clients/partners). 

I'm quite a prolific designer though- I do have a variety of products that my target customers really want (but I never get to produce in bulk)- I mentioned some of them on a [previous response here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/5to3t7/im_a_necktie_designer_from_toronto_a_regalia/ddowncm/). 

I'm familiar with fulfillment centers- I received an offer last year from Shopify to be one of the first to try their Shopify/Amazon integration. Prior to this, an Amazon executive have been emailing me (between 2013-2015) asking if I could give them a time over the phone. I never called. 

I know I need help, but knowing myself, getting me to get help could get tricky. LOL </TEXT>

2 things prevent me from doing it:

(1) Can't pay them. I don't have a regular flow of income so we're living day to day on a very tight budget. 

(2) It makes me very uncomfortable working with other people. I get debilitating physical manifestations of my anxiety when it hits... I don't want people to see me at that state (happens on a daily basis).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That means only one thing- those in charge of the company in question probably know nothing of the Craft. Almost all the necktie collections that I designed since 2009 get sold out within the first few days, if not within a few hours, of offering them for sale. Enterprising individuals know that there's a great demand because they see in my social media channels that customers  keep on asking for more ties. I get a lot of complaints how there's always not enough ties to go around. Unfortunately, increasing production quantities is totally not an option for me at the moment. They're probably trying to fill in the gap or something.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree that the black square and compass tie is a generic pattern. However, the Scottish Rite tie, like the ties in my signature collection, is made from scratch so it is pretty much impossible that you the design from 15 years ago. [Here's a link](http://www.fraternalties.com/products/pre-order-double-headed-eagle-of-lagash-32nd-degree-tie) to the pre-order page for the Scottish Rite tie- the interlinking chains held together by the Square and Compasses as far as I know is an original concept of mine and created from scratch. The simplified and stylized double headed eagle logo itself is created from scratch.  </TEXT>

At the risk of sounding boastful though, my company is at the top of the Masonic necktie niche. I made about USD $10K on our latest collection, $8K of that was made within the first few hours of pre-order. I guess that one thing that makes my customer stick is that I share my life story and the designs I make are usually inspired by what I'm going through at the time of design. I don't know anyone else within our community who does it the way I do.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is partly my fault that this is happening to me. At some point in time I've been so pre-occupied about my mental health issues that instead of talking business, I mostly bombarded my customers with postings and blogs about my struggles. I suppose from those articles where I talked about not wanting to confront people in any situations, certain enterprising individuals realized that I will not go after them if they steal my art. I don't go after individuals anymore but, to borrow words from my daughter, I get "triggered" when a business with an actual physical location does it to me.

I just checked. Formatting is messed up that's why you didn't see it.

Anyway, Im an artist based in Toronto and I design neckties for a particular demographic where word travels fast. I found out last night from a customer that an established store in the UK serving the same demographic have stolen two of my designs. When I looked, I found out they have taken not just 2 but 8. I didn't know what to do because I'm a business newb so i jus calley them out on social media. </TEXT>

<TEXT> About 3 or so years ago, I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I couldn't function well as an office worker so I lost my job and primary source of income. Because I couldn't afford to pay some of my bills, I went on "consumer proposal" which is almost like bankruptcy. I don't think anyone will give me a loan because of that record.

On the positive side, I am capable of pulling in big sales in a matter of hours. We made about USD $10K on our latest collection. $8K of that amount was made on the first few hours when I offered the necktie collection for pre-order. Shopify can corroborate this. By the way, the website of the company who stole my designs also run on Shopify. 

I really appreciate your time sharing your thoughts. Thank you so much! </TEXT>

One of the styles is a necktie that I made exclusively for the [College of Freemasonry](http://imgur.com/kZ3gzGH) here in Ontario, Canada. Those ties are meant to be awarded and was never supposed to be for sale. 

I think they might have taken designs from Masonic Revival and The Craftsman's Apron as well.

**1) What is your product or service?**
I design awesome neckties for the members of the oldest fraternity in the world- Freemasonry. My elevator pitch is *"Family, Freemasonry, Muaythai: Fighting anxiety, depression,   PTSD the natural way- with love, philosophy, and sports."*. And then at that point I bring out my phone and show them [my life story and my cute kids](https://www.instagram.com/fraternalties/). 

**2. What motivated you to start a business?**
I have 3 things: 

**a)** As a means to adapt. I have social anxiety due to traumatic childhood experiences- working with other people have always been a challenge. Art is my therapy- a trait I got from my dad. Entrepreneurship is a natural progression for me. But business savvy I am not- me and my wife fight about this A LOT!

**b)** Growing family and membership requirement. We are a family of 6 now but I was working as a tech support callcenter agent at the time with baby no. 2 on the way when [FraternalTies, the tie that binds](http://www.fraternalties.com) was conceived. I wasn't particularly fond of neckties until I joined the Freemasons- a group of men who love to wear formal attire and speak flowery words when they meet. I thought it would be cool to come to meeting wearing a nice Masonic tie. I looked online and found nothing but tacky ones. I chanced upon an article by My Wife Quit Her Job and an idea came to just design my own necktie and see if anyone would want one as well. We have grown from that 1 necktie that I auctioned on eBay back in 2009.

**c)** My wife constantly challenging me. 

**3. How long have you been working on your startup?**

Since 2009.

**4. What is your 6mo  / 1yr / 5yr plan?**

Honestly, I have nothing penned down. I just go with the flow.

**5. What have been your most memorable positive and negative experiences.**

*Positive:* People telling me how they relate to my artwork and brand on a personal level. It's humbling to know that people are willing to pre-order something and be willing to wait over a year  for a necktie. It feels encouraging that people are willing to give their hard earned money for one of my creations- I have a necktie from our 2010-2011 collection that was originally sold for about 30 something dollars that was sold on eBay for over $200 last year.

*Negative:* My work getting stolen all the time. This is the reason why I'm posting this here. I have pretty much given up chasing after people selling my designs on zazzle, teespring, etc... Last night, a customer informed me about a UK based Masonic regalia company who have taken 2 of my necktie designs. Upon checking their website, I have learned that they have stolen [not just 2 of my creations but 8 of them](http://imgur.com/gallery/Ly125). One of the styles that they have appropriated is the one I made exclusively for the [Fellow of the College of Freemasonry](http://imgur.com/kZ3gzGH)- an education program for Freemasons in Ontario, Canada. Those neckties are not meant to be for sale. They are supposed to be awarded only to those who complete the program. Can I get ideas on what to do? One of my followers already told them that he knows where the original design was from- but my designs still remain up for sale on their website. Can I get compensation from this?

**6. If you could travel back in time, what advice would you give yourself. **

Don't be afraid of emails and phone calls (I currently have 21,700 unread emails). 99% of the time they're actually good stuff- like people asking what's coming up next, or them giving you a good testimonial. 

**7. Not soliciting or selling anything. Actually, everything in [my website](http://www.fraternalties.com) is sold out right now. **

**8. Karma, I hope I have enough. :-)**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Edit:** grammar, grammar.

**Edit:** An update. They commented on my [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/BQbXh0iAHRJ/?taken-by=fraternalties) with this: *"We are just retailer in the UK NOT a manufacturer! As you can see on our website we have more than 70 Masonic Tie Designs We have been supplied all of these designs including the 8 designs which you believe belongs to you. If you have any copyright issues then please contact the manufacturer of these ties directly info@nanbagroup.com"*

<TEXT> Hi all, I know this may seem spammie but this is actually near and dear to me. I'm a graphics artist and dad of four- Muaythai and marijuana literally saved my life. [Story 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4bau2q/is_it_too_late_to_get_in_shape_i_thought_so_but/), [story 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MuayThai/comments/5c9alm/for_those_wondering_if_its_too_late_to_begin_muay/) 

**As a Muaythai addict**, I am delighted to find out that today is also *The Day* of the great sport that saved my life! 

**As a stoner and lover of philosophy**, it's pleasant to share birthdays with the legend Bob Marley. 

**As a Freemason**, it's interesting to note that the founder of the Illuminati, Adam Weishaupt, was also born on this day. I must add though that Illuminati is not Freemasonry. Some people just like to think that somehow they're one and the same. 

What does the Illuminati have to do  with Muaythai? Nothing, unless you believe they control everything. Anway, if you have a thing for nice and unassuming t-shirt, then please consider my work http://bit.ly/2lggfIj *Do it. I command you.* 

Edit: I document my daily progress on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fraternalties/) (in case anyone want to see if the story checks out).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for commenting. Speaking as someone who have lived the life of a bullied child (an only child from a broken family in a society where divorce is outlawed), I used to be wary of people. But the awareness that I am now physically stronger to defend my self and my loved ones from those outside who could potentially us, that awareness gives me a strong sense of confidence and calm that I have never felt before. Same with your experience, my anxiety is at bay as long as I maintain a calm heart and mind and I get that from martial arts.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> (Xpost r/muaythai) Am I too old, or too sick, or too busy for Martial Arts? I'm a 35yr old father-of-four diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Martial Arts saved my sanity and my life. See my journey with before and after videos. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-14 00:05:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> TL;DR If you're just curious to see the before/after videos, see links below. 

I was a physically and mentally abused child. I have a certain naive demeanor that made me a constant target of bullies at home and at school. I didn't know how to label it back then but I've been afraid of gatherings of people for as long as I can remember. This condition gave me a natural aversion to team sports. Though I prefer reading and drawing as my main activities, I also did enjoy certain physical activities that DO NOT involve being with a lot of people such as long walks alone and mountain climbing in my teens. Walking and climbing trees and mountains aside, I have never played any sports in my life before except for Taekwondo back in gradeschool (I never went pass white belt). 

Fast forward to college. I was 16yrs old and on my own for the very first time away from family. I lived in a small apartment cramped with college kids right next to the University. When I say small apartment, I mean 3rd world small (this happened in the Philippines). 

We have a big drug problem in the Philippines and that led to the rise of the current president whose name became entwined with extra judicial killings of users and pushers back home. With that said, more than half of the students in my apartment were meth users. I tried it one time and I was instantly hooked. It made me feel less anxious and depressed. I felt happier when I was on it. I didn't know it then but I was practically self medicating. I kept the habit for 3 years until I began using my college funds for it and I got kicked out of school. I felt extreme shame for my family because I was an honor student before college, and being the last male in the clan to hold the family name, I felt that they have high aspirations for me. 

Fast forward to 2013. My kids number 3 and 4 (twins) were born a day after my mother-in-law lost her battle to breast cancer. 3rd major death in the family within 4 years- first my father-in-law due to sepsis, and then my dad also due to sepsis which led to multiple organ failure. The following year my grandma who I'm really close with passed away too. My marriage was deteriorating at a very rapid rate at this point in time.

One day my left eye began producing tears as if I was crying on just one side of my face. It went on for 7 days until I made a decision to speak to my doctor about it. I was referred to an eye specialist who found my condition peculiar but otherwise nothing was wrong with me physically. After some interviews and test that followed, my doctor concluded that I was having physical manifestations of a mental ailment. I think this was the point where I opened up and spoke about the things that happened in my life. I was referred to a psychiatrist and I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I was prescribed medication which made me feel suicidal so I ditched that and now my therapy and medication is Martial Arts- Muay Thai in particular. 

It's interesting to note that I was over 200lbs (I stand at 5"7 in height) before martial arts. By the time my twins were born, I was totally depressed, couldn't sleep, smoked a lot, ate a lot. My health got so bad that I had to sleep with a CPAP machine just to help me breathe at night. My joints would crack when I walk. My doctor thought that my cartilage and tendons are getting weak so she advised me to avoid all sports and most exercises with the exception of yoga and swimming (no thanks to both). I'm not saying that you disregard your doctor but looking back, if I actually followed her advice and I did not sign up for Muay Thai with my family, I would have never known that all I needed to cure my "weak tendon and cartilage" was Martial Arts. Because of Martial Arts, I became a better version of myself and it placed me in a much happier place.   

I have more videos below but first let me show you my [BEFORE](https://www.instagram.com/p/BI03VgwDXj0/) and [AFTER](https://www.instagram.com/p/BMdQETthg_5/). The 'before' was from November 2015, the after was from November 2016. I don't normally shave my beard except on Movember because I'm a MoBro! I lost about 30 lbs in between Movembers.

[My painful attempt at combining kicks and punches on the heavy bag with my wife on the background also hitting the bag but better than me](https://www.instagram.com/p/BJF28N_jIGC/). I see mustache so I know this video was towards the end of November 2015. For comparison, [here's me from November 2016 video from just a few days ago](https://www.instagram.com/p/BMdCHonh1cv).

[Me throwing roundhouses on the bag on August 2016 eleven months into Muay Thai](https://www.instagram.com/p/BJFp47ajNgw/) I trained consistently with the Kru as our personal trainer for at least 6 months. I stopped formal MT training around summer but I try to run everyday if I can. Thankful that our Kru was kind enough to let me hit the bag when I take my kids there to train. [Here's another video of me throwing consecutive roundhouses back in August](https://www.instagram.com/p/BIySe9MjIlq/).

[Me shadowboxing- day 2 of my coming back to the gym after a long break](https://www.instagram.com/p/BMk9xQzh9fp) After several months of hiatus from formal MT training, I decided to join Krudar Muay Thai once more last week. 

I started this post thinking of just posting my progress videos but I ended up having a joyful trip back to memory lane. Thank you for reading and watching.

<TEXT> I was organizing tons of my scattered files and also looking for stuff I can post on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fraternalties/) when I stumbled upon one of my old [Did-Jah-Kno posters from June 15, 2014](http://imgur.com/YHcbQnP).

It made me wonder how we went from being trusted figures to becoming objects of conspiracy theories? There's no hidden hand here. The primary objective of Freemasonry is simple- and that is to "make GOOD men better." Notice the capitalized word. Our Gentle Craft don't simply admit ALL men. There is no place for men of questionable character in our Brotherhood.

Much like the USA Presidential election, we follow a voting process which involves a background check. A few bad apples slip through the filter every once in a while, but I suspect that a cowan's true color will soon be seen by the Brothers with pure hearts.

<TEXT> Thank you for bringing up the topic of postage (and you forgot to mention custom fee on top of that too). Those things are one of the several reason why we're not increasing production quantities. Good news is that we are working on implementing a [distributorship program](https://form.jotform.com/53524050168248). We have more than a dozen applicants in the US already and a few more International applicants. The future is bright for FraternalTies. If only I have a day job to inject funds it would have been a lot easier to implement things like this.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi everyone! I am John Paul Gomez, a member of Doric Lodge No. 316 in Toronto and an honorary member of Harmonie Lodge No. 699 in Buffalo, NY. In case you're not familiar with FraternalTies, it is a Masonic lifestyle brand that I founded on 2009. Basically, I design stuff using Freemasonry and Philosophy as my inspiration and I monetize some of my designs by turning them into merchandise. I distribute the vast majority of my artworks online for free. I'm a constant target of plagiarist. 

FraternalTies became somewhat of a popular brand among the Freemasonry crowd. The demand for our products far exceeds what we can comfortably handle. Because we are a two person operation only with myself doing the creative and marketing stuff, and my wife on the financial side, we are finding it hard to cope with a huge demand. Being located in Canada with more than 90% of our client base located in the USA presents unique challenges as well specially for a small business like ours. Imagine shipping and customs fees.

Since I lost my job about two years ago due to illness, I found it harder and harder to provide funding for my business endeavors. Like any other business, we need money to pay for hosting, software (Adobe cloud subscription), storage, equipment, manpower, and materials. Though our neckties are bestsellers, the fact that we produce a limited amount only twice in a year means that I have to find other means to support the business that I love and my family at the same time. 

An opportunity came 5 days ago on Holy week Monday when my [personal story of struggle and triumph](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4bau2q/is_it_too_late_to_get_in_shape_i_thought_so_but/) hit the front page of the /r/Fitness sub. Someone introduced to Patreon and I thought it was good. If you're not familiar with Patreon, I invite you to [visit my page](https://www.patreon.com/fraternalties) where I will explain what you can do to help.

That's all for now. I'm here to answer your questions. 

Once more, here's [the link](https://www.patreon.com/fraternalties) to my Patreon page.  

TL;DR: I manage a popular Masonic brand but because I no longer have a dayjob that can inject much needed funding, the business cannot sustain itself anymore. I'm looking for sponsors. There will be rewards. [Here's the link to my Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/fraternalties).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for your comment. It must be the age factor then. The main concern here is that since they were born with the condition, the brain may not learn to see clearly- even if the other eye is okay. Patching can help prevent this but it's so hard to keep a patch on them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Is that wih respect to Peters anomaly or in general?

You put forward a good question. I don't know if it's with respect to Peters Anomaly only. Their doctor, [the Fellowship Director of vision sciences at Sick Kids Toronto](http://www.sickkids.ca/AboutSickKids/Directory/People/A/Asim-Ali-Staff-Profile.html), probably explained this to us but the only thing that stuck to my mind was the low success rate. I remember asking what will happen if the body rejects the cornea and I was told that they will have to wait again until there's another donor.

<TEXT> No quick answer. From what I understand from our doctor, their vision is most probably blurry on both eyes because they were born with the condition and the brain might not be able to learn to "see" good contrast. By the way, Roger have the condition on both eyes but it's very minimal on the left eye. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Roger and Gerry were born a day after my mother-in-law passed away from breast cancer. She was just in her early 60s. My wife, still reeling from her father's death (happened when she was pregnant with our other son), didn't know how to take it when we found out that both our twins have Peters Anomaly on their right eyes. 

It was difficult news to accept at first (specially that corneal transplant only have less than 30% success rate) but over time it turned out that what they have might have been a blessing in disguise. 

They could [read simple names and basic words](https://youtu.be/mqORAw6gDwc) before they turned 2. They also developed a good memory. They could recite (in order- I must add) the colors of the rainbow, days of the week, names of the months, the planets of the solar system, shapes from triangles to dodecahedron, etc... [Here's one of them reciting stuff at 3AM](https://youtu.be/nnYbBiyW1Oo). 

My sons vision might be blurry but their future is definitely bright! I'm feeling mighty proud!

Here's a [recent photo](http://i.imgur.com/1FrFwvB.jpg) of them with the Peters Anomaly in clear view.

<TEXT> If from North America- Toronto, Canada to be precise. But yes, doctors over here can be a little quick to prescribe meds. But some doctors I know also suggest other things such as physical exercise and group therapy and what not. Anything can be easy when one is inspired. The repetitive tasks at hand becomes enjoyable and less of a chore. Finding the inspiration and the motivation to actually move is the hard part. But that shouldn't be a problem with someone with an open mind. Cheers! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I told my trainer about it. For a while we avoid certain jumping exercises and we just worked on [strengthening my leg muscles](http://i.imgur.com/kf71bSY.jpg). I guess it worked because my knees don't crack and I'm not in pain anymore. I can now do jumping squats and other knee intensive routines such as sprinting. But please don't take my word for it- I'm no professional. My family doctor was against it so I consulted a sports doctor. My sports doctor said I should be able to handle the abuse as long as I perform the stretching routines he prescribed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was also stuck in the "I'll start tomorrow" loop. What changed that was when I made my Movember day 1 video and published it on my social media pages on my business website. From that point on, there's no turning back.

why you smoke marijuana 10 mins before working out?

I'm about 10 minutes away from the gym. I find that I'm more in tune with my natural body rhythm if I'm "high". I find that I can skip rope better and I can focus more in technique and power. 

Do smoke only before workouts or are you a recreational user?

I smoke in small amounts (like a bowl per session) throughout the day. I roll joints and enjoy it with my neighbors on Friday nights. MJ helps me with my PTSD and, previously, chronic pain. 

Are there benefits to smoking before exercising?

I'm burning plant material so first there's the risk to your lungs. As for benefits, marijuana affects people differently. It makes me mentally and physically active because of the feeling of motivation that I get from it (it's hard to explain, but I feel it in my chest and my stomach, like a feeling of excitement of some sort). I prefer Sativa in the morning and Indica for night time. 

I hope this helps. There's no shame in asking questions. ;-)

<TEXT> Thanks for the kind words! The conditioning was hell I'm not gonna lie. But the soreness is overwhelmed by a greater sense of well being that I feel after each workout. I strive to be consistent and not miss classes. The more stronger you get, the less painful the routines become and with proper nutrition your recovery rate will speed up. There are high kicks in muay thai but lower kicks is more powerful and can do more damage.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was younger, I would smoke and then watch TV and eat junk food or simply hang out with friends and do nothing. I discovered later on that being a couch potato causes me great grief and anxiety because life will catch up with you if you're living your life slow. I simply switched from smoking and watching TV to smoking and just listening to my body. The best time to listen to my body I find is when I'm doing something productive such as cleaning the house, making art, or working out. I used to get anxious thinking that people judge me when I'm high- but that was because I used to procrastinate when I'm high. Now I have better control and I don't give a hoot about what people think.   </TEXT>

I see what you mean. I go to the gym, nod to people and show them a smile, and then I get to work. I can't say I don't socialize but I keep to a minimum and I focus on what I was there for. That way I don't trip out. :-)

<TEXT> I'm a 35 year old father of four. I design for a living and lived a sedentary lifestyle up until about 6 months ago. I smoked, never played sports, overweight for the most part of my life, had severe sleep apnea, and was a former meth addict (college years. The habit forced me to drop out of an engineering degree on my 3rd year.) 

A couple of years ago I was diagnosed with severe anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I was taking a progressive dose of anti-depressants. The meds were supposed to make me feel somehow confident and uplifted- and was supposed to help me cope with my OCD as well. It made me feel OK at first but later on it made me feel empty and suicidal. After a while of taking it, I found myself no longer enjoying that things that I used to enjoy- like making art, designing merchandise, and cooking. I suspect these activities are somehow tied to my OCD.

I spoke to my family doctor about it and she suggested that perhaps I should try natural means of defeating my mental illness such as exposure therapy and exercise. Due to my plantar fasciitis and joints, back, and knees problem- the only exercise that she would allow me to do was swimming. Thanks to my social anxiety- I abhor swimming. 

July 2015. My 15 yr old girl and 6 yr old boy joined a Muay Thai gym in our area. Driving them and picking them up from the gym became my exposure therapy of sorts. I like the vibe but was very hesitant because I always had the mindset that I was not made for sports. At the urging of my wife and kids (we live in a tiny apartment and, thanks to my severe apnea, they can't stand my snoring anymore) I decided to join them. My doctor was against it but I was born a rebel so I persevered and I found that I thoroughly enjoyed the sport.

I have since lost more than 20 lbs and I continue to burn anywhere between 1-3 lbs per week. My relationship with my wife and family is now waaaay better and I no longer need my prescription. Being physically fit changed my life.

[Here's my Before and After photo. 5 months difference.](http://i.imgur.com/Zlupy3p.jpg) Sorry I have to watermark it, I don't want to fall prey to those with mercenary motives who steal photos like this and use it for their own profit.

TL;DR An overweight, depressed, traumatized, and sick 35 year old father of four who never played sports his whole life tried Muay Thai and almost 6 months later became awesome. :-D

Edit: I violated Rule 4: Progress/Achievement posts require relevant information. Sorry mods! :-)

*********Some information about myself:*********

Beginning (September 24, 2015) Sex, Weight, Height, and Age: [M, 200 lbs, 5"7, 34](http://i.imgur.com/kqUFPwH.jpg)
Ending Sex, Weight, Height, and Age: [M, 178.6 lbs, 5"7, 35](https://www.instagram.com/p/BDH5QhVwu7d)

*********Detailed diet and exercise routine:*********
I jumpstarted my diet change by [eating nothing but sardines with rice and olives](https://www.instagram.com/p/998s1EQu2Q) (and a lot of greens) for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the entire month of November 2015. From December onwards- I pretty much eat anything that I cook and serve my kids but in moderation (I have a Filipino background and we consume a lot of rice. I used to eat more than 2 cups per meal but now I'm down to 1). I have my cheat days on Fridays and have pizza and soda. On Saturdays I workout even if I don't really have to so I can eat my Tim Horton's chocolate dip donut. I drink a medium sized 1 cream 1 sugar coffee in the morning and sometimes at night as well. I smoke marijuana 10 minutes before workout and throughout the day actually. I still smoke the occasional cigarette but I can now go for days without it. I have four kids and a business to run so I sleep anywhere between 3-6 hours only every night.

*********Exercise routine:*********
Monday, Wednesday, Friday: Muay Thai conditioning and some bag/pad work
Saturday: Light warm up and some bag work

What is Muay Thai conditioning? It varies but basically it's about 45minutes - 1hour of nonstop workout followed by about half an hour of hitting the pads or the heavy bag. Here's a sample workout: 

Warm up routine:
*3-10 minutes skipping rope or 10-20 minutes run
*3 sets of 40 jumping jacks, 40 front back front, 40 alternating knees, 40 right kick ups, 40 left kick ups, 15 jump squats

Heavy bag routine:
*4 sets of 25 right swing kicks, 25 left swing kicks, 25 right push kicks, 25 left push kicks, 50 speed jabs and cross punches. [Here's a video of me and my wife doing 50 swing kicks each each leg](https://youtu.be/R30EIHJZjTo). 

*********Here are some tips that help me get from point A to point B.*********

* BE TRUE TO YOURSELF. I admitted to myself that I was sick and I needed help. And so I did admit and I did it publicly. I joined Movember on 2014 and [I blogged about my struggle on my own business website](http://www.fraternalties.com/blogs/news/15850180-demons-depression-and-mustache). Some people thought that it would be the end of my business career for coming out like that but instead my business received more interest. Nobody joined me on my Movember campaign though.

* USE SOCIAL MEDIA. Let your intent be known. I always wanted to be fit but the attachment to my bad habits was strong. When I was trying to quit smoking, I read somewhere that it would be helpful if you let your family and friends know that you're quitting. There's a psychology behind this but that's beyond my area of expertise. So on November 2015 I participated in Movember once more and told my followers in Facebook about it. I also made a cringe-worthy [Movember day 1 video](https://youtu.be/LTpj8xtMTLs). I only managed to get 1 MoBro supporter- my personal trainer but that was enough to motivate me.

* ADD SOME GIMMICK. The more dramatic the better. It's fun for you (and your audience and those around you will react positively!). Example: [I ate nothing but sardines with rice and olives](https://www.instagram.com/p/998s1EQu2Q) for breakfast, lunch, and dinner everyday for the entire month of November. [I skipped rope with PVC rope wearing my suit and tie](https://youtu.be/KqGzMqaOPtM). There are other crazy stuff that I did but the idea is to push yourself and enjoy doing it.

* INVOLVE YOUR LOVED ONES. Be an inspiration to each other. Actually, in my case, my wife and kids involved me. My kids are so into Muay Thai that my 6y/o asked me to make him a [Youtube channel dedicated to Muay Thai](https://youtu.be/B-P-2wQY8gE). My 15 y/o girl can't wait to fight in the ring, and even our [2 y/o twins are active in the gym](https://youtu.be/Y9_h6zBAeZ0). 


Edit 2: 50 kicks each leg for a total of 100 kicks per person. 
Edit 3: Trying to fix formatting to make it more readable. I'm fail at this. Also added a couple of words for clarity. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a beginner student, and haven't been to other gyms but most practitioners that I have met so far refer to the actual certified teachers as "Kru" and masters as "Ajahn". As for the trainers/coaches, we call them by name. Also, Ajahn Suchart whom I have personally met is big on culture, spirituality, and such so he appreciates students call their teachers with the proper salutation to show respect.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for your valuable feedback. The video is actually meant to be humorous. He saw Saenchai doing his signature kick and since my boy can do cartwheels he thought he can pull it off. Well, obviously he was wrong. This video is proof to him that a lot of training is needed if you want to be good at one thing (on one of the annotations we mentioned that Saenchai said in an interview that it took him 3 years to perfect the kick). Question: Did you see the YouTube annotations by any chance? I noticed that if you watch the video on mobile, the annotations do not show up. I just realized that the viewer might miss the humour without the annotations turned on.

<TEXT> I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I am a Freemason and baptized as a Christian but my point of view is different from most of my Christian brothers. 

You can find in ancient holy scriptures many references to mental health problems, albeit veiled. 

This is my favourite from the Bible:
This is why I speak to them in parables: "Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand."

Another of my favourite is this one from Hinduism (also credited to Buddha, etc.)

Be careful with your thoughts because your thoughts become your words. Be careful with your words because your words become your actions. Be careful with your actions because you actions become your behaviors. Be careful with your behaviors because your behaviors become your habits. Be careful with your habits because your habits become your character. And be careful with your character because your character becomes your destiny. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I grew up in a very Christian family. My [uncle is a well known psychologist and missionary priest](http://www.healingeucharistinc.com/fr-glenn-paul-m-gomez-svd/) from where I was originally from. I consider myself very Christian until I separated from my family and moved to a city far away from my hometown to go to university. I met people from all walks of life, got into drugs, got disillusioned, dabbled with atheism, and eventually emerged as an agnostic. Then I moved to Canada, was Initiated, Passed, and Raised, and now I find myself going back to my Christian roots but with a very different point of view. I consider myself a follower of Jesus but I don't see him as God like most of my fellow Christians. To me he is much like Hiram whose work must be emulated instead of himself adored as a deity. I hope this helps.   </TEXT>

We have to appreciate the fact that the Bible is actually made up of 66 books with around 800,000 words in total. Print that on regular paper (as opposed to the fine and thin pages of the Bible) with size 12 font and you end up with a gargantuan book so heavy that it will never leave home. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have [four kids](https://youtu.be/_t8aY8qE2TI) but I'm not sure if I can be of much help to you. I'm very new to Muay Thai- I joined when my twins turned 2 around October last year. From my experience, consider yourself lucky if you get a 2 hour continous sleep during the first 3 months at least. If your body can handle the rigour of Muay Thai conditioning with just that much rest time, I'd say by all means do it. Otherwise just enjoy the time with your wife and your little bundle of joy. Congratulations!

"What nobler relationship than that of friend? What nobler compliment can man bestow than friendship? The bonds and ties of the life we know break easily, but through eternity one bond remains - the bond of fellowship - the fellowship of atoms, of star dust in its endless flight, of suns and worlds, of gods and men. The clasped hands of comradeship unite in a bond eternal - the fellowship of spirit." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a 34 year old father of 4. I have a sedentary job working from home as a designer for [my own company](https://www.facebook.com/FraternalTies) I used to smoke a lot, struggled with meth addiction, diagnosed with severe social anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Last year I lost my day job due to my mental condition and almost lost my marriage. I was overweight, suffered from sleep apnea, almost always in a bad mood, and was in a terrible shape overall. Muay Thai helped me find ways to channel my anxiety (i.e. intense conditioning and hitting the heavy bag after) and in effect made me healthier, stronger, more calm, collected, and focused. I get more respect from my kids (the best feeling on earth!) and those around me because people appreciate it when they see [hardwork and actual results](http://i.imgur.com/V54MXoN.jpg).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have to downvote you. I'm living with depression, severe anxiety, and PTSD and I can guarantee you that Muay Thai is indeed way cheaper than therapy. 

A little background: I was diagnosed about 3 years ago only but suffered from it practically my whole life. I was prescribed zoloft and other related meds. Worked well at first until I started getting suicidal thoughts. I lost my job, was taken to jail due to my condition, almost lost my marriage too. 

I never played sports my entire life and I don't have much confidence in my physical capabilities. A lot of my anxiety comes from the thought that I may not be able to defend my loved ones in case I have to. [Last September I joined a local gym here in Toronto and my life turned around](http://imgur.com/V54MXoN). What I pay for Muay Thai per month is nothing compared to what I went through living with depression. I still have the anxiety in me but it is not as severe. I am no longer depressed and absolutely more confident physically and mentally. 

Source: I don't use a throwaway account. You can go back in my history and you will see that I talk about this things. I even wrote a blog about my mental ordeal on November 2014 and posted on my [business website](http://www.fraternalties.com/blogs/news/15850180-demons-depression-and-mustache). There is no shame in mental illness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Put it this way, I am a 34 year old father of four. I work from home as an [artist/designer of sorts](http://www.fraternalties.com/) (can be a very sedentary job). I have never played any kind of sports my whole life save for a few Taekwondo classes I took back in gradeschool (never went past white belt). The only physical activity for me was cleaning the house, cooking, and running after the kids. Before Muay Thai, I was overweight, clinically depressed (anxiety + non-combat PTSD), smoked a lot, ate a lot, suffered from severe sleep apnea, and was just trapped in a bad physical shape overall. 

I have been interested in Muay Thai forever but was hesitant in joining because I have constant fears in my head that I wasn't good enough and will just probably end up either hurt or humiliated. 

Last September I decided to sign up after much encouragement from my wife and kids who were at the time beginner students at a local gym in our neighborhood here in Toronto. I found out that all my fears were unfounded. The people are respectful, nobody's acting tough or aggressive, and everyone is just nice. I've been training regularly with my entire family for 3 months now and I love every bit of it. [Check out my before and after.](http://i.imgur.com/V54MXoN.jpg). Mind you that I joined the gym on September 24, 2015 only. That before and after only have 3 months in between.

Go for it my friend, you will not regret it! Sawasdee kap!

<TEXT> Hi there! Though I never bought anything from your website, I was one of the many who admire the novelty of it all. I really liked it at first and would visit every once in a while but after some time the novelty, I guess, simply wore off. There's nothing there that gave me a sense of brand loyalty that could have helped me keep on coming back so I guess I just slowly forgot that the website existed. Until today.

I'm not sure if I can be of much help but here are my thoughts:

1. Connect and Engage your followers - you're on all social networks as you mentioned but you really do not have a strong presence. Take your [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Thisiswhyimbroke) for example, the posts are very sporadic and most of them are shallow posts like "please like this page" "heyyy all". You cannot expect your followers to become fanatics if you don't know how to communicate like you believe in yourself and your merch. 

2. People want to see fresh and curated content- some of the stuff on display there are the same stuff that I remember seeing years ago.

3. Use your own products and posts photos of yourself actually using it. Why would I buy from someone who don't even believe on the same stuff they're selling? Use your own stuff and be proud of it. Post photos and true stories and slowly develop a cult of personality. Became the product and it would be easy to sell anything. 

These ideas I give you are from my own personal experience. Please visit my [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/FraternalTies) and see some of my posts and the comments from my audience so you would get a clearer view of what I'm talking about. I hope this helps.

<TEXT> I was the Senior Warden when due to a combination of health, marital, and financial issues I was left with no other choice but to submit my resignation. Our W.M. at the time was gracious enough to extend his service as the master of the lodge for another year just to wait for me, but right in the middle of my 2nd term as the S.W., I had to step out of the progression line to the east because things in my personal life are definitely going south. 

Lucky for me, I never felt that I was left outside of the 'inner circle' because I'm still their go-to guy when they need someone to deliver the final charges (any degree) to a candidate- meaning I still go out and help if I can sans the administrative responsibilities that comes with being an officer. The other thing is I also have a Masonic facebook page with a good amount of activity and following. 

I was right next in line to be the Master of my lodge but I gave it up for my family's sake and I don't regret it. It did not make me less of a Mason. Titles mean nothing to me- character is all that counts. My hiatus turned me into a better observer. It's been a good experience overall.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The "hooks" are 2 wedges with a spacer in between. Without the spacer, you don't have to drive it through the rock- the wedges will simply fit right into the hole without much effort. Once the wedges are in place, simply insert the spacer in between and align the holes and secure it.

It's Teespring but this is not a fundraising campaign or anything. I just need a hoodie and I really want this for myself. If I make 75 bucks from it, I'd use that for grocery and I'd be more than happy. Not looking to sell a lot of it either- I set the goal really low so we can get it printed right away. If you like the design and would like to have one for yourself or a brother, here's the link: https://teespring.com/freemasonhoodies </TEXT>

Here's me cable towing this afternoon at the gym- https://youtu.be/ChsDFKMSHvo

Some background: This is my second year doing Movember. I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for several years now. I was taking Zoloft until it made me feel suicidal. I'm no health professional and I will not recommend anything to you but intense exercise is a big help to me. I joined a local Muay Thai gym just last month and I am already feeling the positive physical and mental benefits.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am Filipino and there's no problem like this in the Philippines (as far as I know) or any of the North American Filipino lodges that I've been to. I spent my entire DeMolay years in the Philippines but I was Initiated, Passed, and Raised in a 'white' Canadian Lodge- I was one of the only two Filipinos in my lodge. We're the combo-breakers. I love my mother lodge will all my heart, I enjoy the deep philosophical exchange with my lodge brothers, and I do not have any inclination of joining another lodge; but after the labor is done, the refreshments consumed, and the parting words said, we all go back into our cars and go our separate ways- of course until we meet again at the temple. 

This is simply not how it is done back home. Over there, Brothers there know each other's birthday, there are regular family events (fundraising, talent shows, etc.), they visit each other's house, and there's a certain degree of fun frat attitude that just cements the lodge together- and they carpool a lot. They don't just go to lodge to usher candidates and to recite words- they also go to have fun. Philosophy and deep thoughts are all nice and cool but the fun factor is a good motivator so if that is missing you will have troubles getting members back in Lodge. Now, gimme me my trillions.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> In Masonic usage, I was told that the actual name for this sign is the 'Masonic Honor Dots'. Some say that it was perhaps derived from the 3 supernals. Holy Trinity; Holy Family; the myth of Isis, Horus, Osiris... Nobody really knows the actual connection but since a lot of Masons insist that everything good comes in threes- instead of using a plain and boring single dot, we use three to make the punctuation thrice blessed and perhaps lucky. :-) </TEXT>

I guess this is where I failed design-wise. In my head, I'm thinking that the random arrangement and positioning of the guns in the artwork will imply a state of disorder and that those guns are illegal. I suppose it will not be readily grasped and requires a little bit of explanation to get. Thanks for the feedback! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A bit of background: I'm a Toronto based artist/entrepreneur and father of 4. I make money by merchandising my art. My Facebook page have a decent amount of active following. Roughly 90% of my customers and page followers are in the United States. My niche is very narrow and specific. There's really not much money in it (because I suck at business mostly) but I really enjoy what I do. 

I'm an immigrant. I landed here on November 2004. I have chosen this city because it is diverse and peaceful (and everyone is so polite!) I thought to myself that Toronto is the best place to build a nest. 

I am now a 34 year old with four kids in tow and can't help but be sensitive to the bad things that are happening in our streets beginning on Boxing Day 2005 (I used to work at the Bell Trinity Square and I was there in the area when it happened). The gun violence rate just kept on climbing year after year since that. We used to live near the Science Centre and it's not exactly a peaceful place- there's police presence all the time, on the day we moved out, someone got shot in the head and died where my daughter used to wait for her schoolbus. 

We are in a different location now but there is juvenile delinquency in the area where we live- we had to call the police on a few occasions because of this. We have been harassed, stolen from, family van vandalized on a freezing 2014 Christmas week... At least there's no gun involved... yet... As much as I would like to move my family away from this particular neighborhood, I can't because I don't have a steady job that could afford us a more secure place (thanks to my anxiety and PTSD).

I thought to myself, if I can't afford to move my family to a safer place, what can I do to influence a change even on a minute scale. That's when the idea for the poster hit me. I imagine the red maple leaf in the Canadian Flag, the maple leaf shape was formed by gun silhouettes arranged in no particular order- the guns were arranged as such to symbolize disorderliness and illegal activities; and the red color that used to cover the entirety of the Maple Leaf shape is slowly draining away because of gun violence brought upon us by disorderliness and irresponsible gun ownership. I began working on it last night and finalized it today this afternoon and I was very happy with the result. I published it on my Facebook page and, following my usual modus operandi, made a Teespring campaign out of it as well (I do this to get some grocery money and to protect the copyright of the artwork). 

After just a few minutes I found out right away that my followers do not appreciate my latest creation. Now I am feeling torn, part of me thinks that I should protect my business and the sensibilities of my mostly American followers by unpublishing the "offending artwork", but at the same time I also feel strongly about the gun violence that is rising in this city that I now call my home... What should I do? Is the artwork sending the wrong message? Your thoughts will be appreciated. Here's the link to the poster: http://i.imgur.com/T4VNKgm.jpg

<TEXT> I think I was about 14 years old when I joined the International Order of DeMolay sponsored by Mindoro Lodge No. 157 F AM in the Philippines. I moved to Canada when I was 24 and became a Freemason not too long after. I joined because I felt that it was a natural progression for me, being a DeMolay and all. I wasn't really thinking much about philosophy and spiritual growth when I first joined- I just wanted to belong. I'm 34 now, been through a lot of dark times, and have a completely different mindset- stronger and better thanks to Freemasonry. Our officers are mostly in their 20's-30's. We're a young lodge and don't have a lot of PM's.  </TEXT>

I haven't met him in person though but we have exchanged emails in the past and have mutual support and respect for each others products. I regularly post selfies of myself wearing Grip or Token hat on my own business page.

I don't know if he have a business partner who can help out with the administration but I think he's doing this by himself. I certainly can't speak on his behalf but as a small time business owner myself, responding back in time can be a real challenge sometimes especially when personal life gets in the way. I know I still have unread emails from years ago. Have you tried messaging him in FB?  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  If I were to desire to see the metaphorical darkness that all religions have as an adversary to the true God of that faith then I can do so and by doing so learn as star wars says, The Dark Side. Ultimately leading me to a God of darkness... God creating all from the void and being one with the void is an entity of nothingness, and if darkness is just an absence of light the true home of God is darkness.

Like you, I am also born and raised a Catholic. We have nuns and priests in the family, an uncle of mine, a psychologist and SVD missionary priest, is currently one of the regular TV mass hosts in the Philippines- the country with the largest Christian population in Asia (5th in the world). I don't mean to brag, I just want to quickly paint you a portrait of my Catholic background so you would know where I am coming from.

I am sad to say that despite that kind of Catholic upbringing, my human mental faculties is not sufficient enough to dissect and have a meaningful conversation with you about the true nature of God and, as a Freemason, I am not inclined to talk about anything that I personally know nothing much about mainly because Freemasons are typically well read and well informed and I don't want to sound like an idiot- so I'd just share with you this quote from Ghandi "If you do not see God in the next person you see, you need look no further."

If your quest for Light is just leading you to a dark place, then perhaps Freemasonry is not for you at this point in time.

<TEXT> For this particular topic, is it really important to cite another source if the answer you seek is observable, immutable, and contained within the ritual itself? Savannah animals, field workers, farmers, and operative masons all have one thing in common- they must take a break when the sun is at its meridian- it's a biological thing to go from labour to refreshment when the sun is at its highest peak- it's all about energy conservation. This point in time is known to boost the power of the brother who sits in the south by over 9000. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my youth I was a diehard Christian, and then I was a stupid atheist, and then a quasi mystic who tried to answer my life's questions by dabbling with drugs and by paying attention to false prophets. I was lost, confused, and angry. I lived my life just drifting along not really knowing where I was from or where I was going.

I joined Freemasonry in 2008 because I felt like it was a natural progression for me as a DeMolay- I didn't expect to gain much in terms of self-improvement or self-knowledge. All I had in my head when I joined was the romantic notions about the connection of Freemasonry to the Knights Templars and ancient mystery schools. 

I began to notice changes in me about a couple of years after I joined when I sponsored two of my friends. To impress them, I memorized the 1st Degree Past Master's / Final Charge and volunteered to deliver it on their Initiation. I was the Junior Deacon at the time. The many compliments that I received encouraged me to memorize all 3 Final Charges as well as other parts of the ritual. 

As I became more adept with my knowledge of the Work, delivering the lectures became second nature. I no longer worry about forgetting my lines. Because I no longer worry about the next word, my mind was free to explore my true self and relate the contents of the charges / lectures to my own experiences. It was at this point when I realized that our ritual holds the key to releasing my full potential as a human being. 

Being a Freemason helped me figure out the many mental complex that used to bog me down. The lessons that I have learned helped me keep my sanity when we went through a series of tragedy which involved 5 deaths in our family and other misfortunes. I am now more confident with myself, my faith firm, more accepting of things that cannot be controlled, and in many ways more focused and more certain of what the future holds. 

TL;DR
Freemasonry illuminated my path.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just want to share what Albert Pike said about commenting on the motives of others.

"Those who are invested with the power of judgment should judge the causes of all persons uprightly and impartially, without any personal consideration of the power of the mighty, or the bribe of the rich, or the needs of the poor. That is the cardinal rule, which no one will dispute; though many fail to observe it. But they must do more. They must divest themselves of prejudice and preconception. They must hear patiently, remember accurately, and weigh carefully the facts and the arguments offered before them. They must not leap hastily to conclusions, nor form opinions before they have heard all. They must not presume crime or fraud. They must neither be ruled by stubborn pride of opinion, nor be too facile and yielding to the views and arguments of others. In deducing the motive from the proven act, they must not assign to the act either the best or the worst motives, but those which they would think it just and fair for the world to assign to it, if they themselves had done if; nor must they endeavor to make many little circumstances, that weigh nothing separately, weigh much together, to prove their own acuteness and sagacity. These are sound rules for every juror, also, to observe." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many have offered to buy us out. Some of them Masonic entrepreneurs who also post here in this very sub. 

I am very much aware of the huge potential of FraternalTies. My mailing list have an Open Rate of 53.3%, the eCommerce industry average Open rate is just 15.9%. Our Click Through Rate is 15.1%, while the industry average is only 2.9%. 

My website have been suspended repeatedly and, in terms of SEO, that is very bad. Our Google ranking have suffered significantly but the interest for my creations have only gone up. The demand continue to increase despite the repeated Google suicide. That tells me something.

Besides those points that I mentioned above, the primary reason I don't want to let go of FT is because I have achieved nothing else in life besides building this brand. I want to pass it on to my kids. I'm currently not capable of performing many of the duties attached to being a business owner but I am doing my best and I continue to look forward to that day when I will be fully capable.

<TITLE> Original 2012 print out of popular Freemason meme on the auction block - 8hrs left </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-29 20:17:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Edit: Correction. 6 hrs left till end of auction.

Brethren, 

Although submissions such as this is generally frowned upon, I am making this post because I was encouraged by some members who genuinely like my work. If you don't like to read about any offerings or promotions of some sort on reddit, please do not read further. If you like to collect awesome (and potentially historical) Masonic stuff and at the same time help a business survive, then please read on.

I am putting up for auction the Masonic meme that brought FraternalTies to the map. [Please click this link and read description for more info.](http://www.ebay.ca/itm/Masonic-memorabilia-meme-poster-FraternalTies-/281638333694)

I am very proud of what I have achieved with FraternalTies- but I am now at a point in my life where I am seriously considering closing shop in six months or less unless we recover our losses. The thought of this makes me sad because we're at the peak of our popularity. 

As some of you may already know, I am on disability with no benefits, I would have funded my FraternalTies projects myself like I always had with the money that used to flow from my day job. But I am out of work, hence I am relying on our supporters on this one. 

If you like my work but cannot participate in this auction, please consider sharing the link. We only have about 6 hours left till the end of the auction. 

Important: I have been accused of artificially inflating the value of my creations. It's a most unpleasant feeling. Please know that the starting price of this auction is 0.99 cents and that ALL my Masonic themed artworks are available in high resolution for FREE download here at http://fraternalties.imgur.com/

<TITLE> Toronto UFO around 2:50 am travelling southbound. Seen near Lawrence and DVP </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-25 08:35:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First of all I know exactly how this sounds like. I stepped outside to have a smoke. When I looked up, I saw six to 9 dull red lights (like bokeh) attached to the edges of a dark rectangular craft travelling at the speed of a regular jet southbound. It was huge. I did not hear any rumbling sound except perhaps the steady hum of the DVP. It was almost overhead me when I saw it. I freaked out and called my wife who was in the living room. She hesitated but when she gave in, the craft was already a little far ahead and she had troubles seeing it.

I am not making this up. I also do not wish to make a fuss out of this. But I know what I saw and I am really curious to know if anyone else have seen it.

I'm not sure if this matters but as proof that I am not some hallucinating nut crack, here's a link to my fb page (I got nothing to gain from this) https://www.facebook.com/FraternalTies

edit:

I was advised, for a good reason, to add a footnote. I experienced an awesome sighting but I don't believe nor meant to imply that I don't know therefore aliens. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was elected and installed as the Senior Warden for my lodge for this Masonic year. After just about a couple of stated meetings, I had to resign my post as the SW. I'm in a situation where I have to choose between welfare of family, or the prestige, pressure, and many responsibilities of becoming a WM next year. I consulted my WM, and other Brothers that I trust. They expressed their understanding of my situation and I was eventually allowed to resign (I first expressed my desire to drop out when I was elected as JW)

This caused some issues because:
1. I am the only one in my lodge who have all the PM charges memorized.
2. Our lodge also have attendance issues and financial issues on top of that.

Though free from the responsibilities of an officer, I promised to attend when there is degree work so I may help them with the PM charge. To help with the attendance problem, I regularly promote my lodge on my facebook page. I don't have to be there every stated meeting but I feel no guilt because I took it upon myself to have minor roles that I know I can fulfill. This arrangement works for me.

I'd say that you should have an honest talk with your WM and express your heart to him while it's early. You could stick it out for a few more years but if your heart is not there neither the lodge nor you would benefit. </TEXT>

I do this primarily as a form of therapy and to express my love of Freemasonry, profit is a nice bonus but what I make is not even enough to secure a guaranteed income every month. If I stop doing this (it's the only thing that I do) will you help feed my kids and keep a roof above their heads? I guess not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> AliveShoes allows the designer to customize the shoes in many but limited ways. I said in "many ways" because you can select your preferred color for the sole, the sole stitching, details, lace, tongue. The color combination is many and varied. But I say "limited" because, though you can change the color of the individual parts to your liking, you cannot dictate how the actual shoe will be cut and sewn. As much as I would like to have the skirret or whatever tool woven in the details, it's not gonna happen. In other words, I can modify the colors but cannot change the template. 

This presents a unique challenge for me as an artist. I want a shoe design that will remind me of the checkered floor (emblematic of life itself..) but how? My solution was to alternate white and black starting from the white sole, and then the black sole stitching, and then white and black details, and so on. It's an abstract representation of the checkered floor of life.

The flower of life hidden behind the tongue. What is that for? If the  color theme of the shoe is a reference to the ebb and flow of life, the colorful flower of life which is hidden in plain sight is a representative of that divine spark in you. Today you might be standing on a white tile, but tomorrow who knows trouble may come and you will find yourself standing on a black tile. The colorful flower of life is there to remind you that despite the black and white nature of life, there are colorful slices of joy in between if you know where to look.

I really hope that makes sense. I'm still learning English.

<TEXT> Find me a graphics artist who can do this http://i.imgur.com/sA8FuKK.jpg from scratch in a few minutes. It's my own rendition of a sacred geometrical pattern called the Flower of Life. This piece is one of the most technically challenging pieces that I have ever made in my decade and half of experience in graphic design. It took me many days (not mere minutes) and many revisions to get it right. If it's such an important piece, why did I placed it behind the tongue where it is hidden from sight? That would have been a good question to ask me. Yet it's easier for you just to just assume and open your mouth. You should be ashamed of yourself for passing judgment without a conscious effort to learn and understand things first. Shame shame shame. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hail from a "classy" family. My late father was a public school teacher, you can say that he used the parents and students community for a living. My mother is a nurse working in a hospice, I guess you can also say that she's using the old and dying to earn a few bucks. I happened to be an artist and web developer whose expertise lies in the production of Masonic arts and crafts. It's the only thing that I do. If I do not promote and further enhance my craft, what will become of me?

You say your many social media hangouts was polluted by these shoes, how difficult is it to just skip it if you don't want it? Not because you do not see the Square and Compasses means it is not Masonic. You climbed the ladder and reached the 32nd step and you proudly display it but you act no better than an eavesdropping cowan whose mouth is faster than his thoughts. You sir are very rough. It is men like you why I bear my current flair. One can climb the ladders and ropes beyond the 3rd but it doesn't guarantee further enlightenment (and maturity if I may add). One word of advice to you, if you do not see Freemasonry in littlest things, look no further- you will never find it. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> EDIT: Shameless is the word I was looking for (non-native speaker)

I don't enjoy posting promotions like this on reddit because redditors have a special place for people like me who sell stuff online. But I am doing it anyway because I learned that to feed a family one must have a thick skin, and also because of the fact that a few members here asked me in the past if I could also post some of my creations and offerings right here (I do my product promotions almost exclusively in Facebook only and for some reason a lot of you apparently do not have Facebook). 

Anyway, here's the link to see the World's first Masonic sneakers. Inspired by the Checkered Floor and the Flower of Life. :-)

<TEXT> We all know that to be really really good at something- be it singing, business dealings, or playing particular sport, we have to devout our life to it. We have to eat, live, and breathe it. But of course, the intensity of how we want it is inversely proportional to the amount of work that we want to put in. So we "pray" to give us the courage to go on and be consistent with the repetitive work that must be done. When we pray, we do not necessarily send our prayers to a sentient "higher" being, prayer is just another way to calm and condition the mind where the real higher being resides- the real you.

I'm a Christian Freemason. Not that it matters. </TEXT>

I will have big problems with lawyers and accountants and contractors using the S C to promote their business- that I would call mercenary motive because by using the S C, they're advertising that they can be trusted by virtue of being a Mason which is very very wrong. But 4 pieces of bacon in the form of the S C (without the G if I may add) for a fellow artist Mason... I don't know... Maybe I got this whole Freemasonry thing wrong. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm quite intimately familiar with all charges, thank you very much. The S C to me means a lot of things and one of that is kaizen and, ultimately, perfection. What we have here is a Brother who asked for my assistance promoting his LIVELIHOOD, I mean his expertise happened to be curing meat. He's been doing this since I was just 9 years old (1990), would it be fair to speculate that this is his passion (aka his craft)? 

As a graphics artist, I have rendered the S C in a lot of different ways as tribute to the working Mason such as [this one for Mason chefs](http://imgur.com/2o2wbq3), [this one for Mason broadcasters](http://imgur.com/geXi8cs), and [this one for the manual labourer](http://imgur.com/JOabd3w) and I heard no complaints at all. Now a Brother who makes bacon and I hear this?!

Mercenary motives? Please enlighten me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, was sup, man? I hope all is well. While I'm certainly no Manly P. Hall, I know a few useless facts which may help guide you in finding the answer to your question.

Everything good comes in threes. The Trinity, or the universal mystical number 3 is the sum of [unity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(philosophy) ), that spot on the pyramid occupied by the eye on the back of a dollar bill, where all things emanated from, and [power](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyad_(Greek_philosophy)). A triangle is a shape made of 3 points. A triangle is deemed more mathemagical specially if all the sides are equal in length and all the angles measure 60 degrees. 

Good luck with your search for light.

<TEXT> Whoa. Easy tiger. My apologies, I thought that the design on the shirt plus the fact that I was having lunch actually makes Masonic sense. Also, I was hoping that someone would notice that cool Masonic hat- a gift from my friend D with Grip or Token. They make the most awesome Masonic hats!

Here's a better view (see link below) of the design on that shirt that I'm wearing. I hope that you appreciate the significance of the grain on the background. There's the salt and pepper (black and white, like a particular pavement) shaker with the seven liberal herbs and spices sprinkling out of it too. Spice of life, gotta love it. Did anyone notice the steak in the middle? It's not T bone, but rather a G bone. Get it? What about the tools that form the S C, it's not your usual fork and knife, isn't it? These, the chef knife and the bbq fork, are the tools of those who serve, not merely of those who partake. Finally, before I get flak, yes- it is on the second degree on purpose. Work... Encourage industry... Reward merit... Just some of the words I live by, I learned that from a particular charge from a particular degree.

Anyway, despite having just celebrated my 3rd reddit cake day, apparently, I still don't get reddit. So, my friend, please illuminate me on what is reddit material vs stuff that belongs in Facebook. Or would you be kind enough to direct me to the proper sub for this photo that do not belong? Or maybe I'll just go back to digg. (not)

<TEXT> As I have already mentioned, I ended up taking the position after much "encouragement" from the Brethren- I agreed but with the understanding that I will not be forced to serve as the WM once I'm done serving as the SW. I have not "bothered" to attend Lodge due to a string of deaths in the family plus the recent birth of my twins who are both afflicted with Peter's Anomaly. I am currently suffering from severe anxiety. Besides what I do in Facebook, I'm unable to work a regular job. Do I feel I'm letting my Lodge down, all the time, but they keep on assuring me that they understand and I'm always more than welcomed to drop by. By the way, if anyone is in Toronto, we have an EA Degree tomorrow 7PM at the Thornhill Masonic Temple, if you got nothing to do, come visit us. I will not sit as the SW but I will deliver the PM charge. :-) </TEXT>

I have been delivering all Past Master charges (1,2, and 3) since I was JD. The PMs are impressed and want to see me serve the Lodge as its WM one day. But the thing is I have anxiety problems and I don't think I'm cut to lead. Long story short, I declined the JW position but ended up taking it after much nudging... same thing with SW and now I'm lined up to be the WM next year.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Brethren,

My apologies for the blatant promotion. I am in need of help and have to make few extra sales. I remember that a couple of Brothers here on /r/freemasonry have previously expressed interest should we ever do a rerun. And so here it is - http://i.imgur.com/txH6XeL.jpg

We are reprinting the stylized SC shirt (above) on black American Apparel tri-blend Short Sleeve Track Shirt http://store.americanapparel.net/tr401.html

And my favourite Sublime Shirt (bottom) on American Apparel's heaviest Jersey t-shirt- the HJ400 Hammer t-shirt. The one shown in the photo is from the first batch- been using it at least twice a week  for about six months now. I machine wash and dry it after each use. It gets better/feels better on the skin with age and the print is still amazing. It's my favourite work shirt and I always wear it with pride. 

The 'Sublime shirt' have four prints. (1) "SUBLIME" on front; (2) "MASON 3 degree" on back; (3) the Plumb tool on the left sleeve; (4) and the Level on the right.

Flat rate prices:

Stylized SC: $32
Sublime shirt: $35

Flat rate shipping and handling:

US/Canada: $12
International: $18

Due to some financial complications, our website is down and will be so for the next few days. But I would like to know in advance if there is still an interest from this group. 

10% discount for /r/freemasonry members.

S F,

<TITLE> When reading online comments, what voice do you "hear"? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-12 07:56:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm sorry if the question is vague. English is not my first language. In your mind's eyes and ears, when reading comments- do you hear or visualize someone of specific gender? Does he or she speak with a specific accent? Nationality? Do you hear a soccer mom, or a basement dwelling teenager? A young adult about to enter the "real" world or maybe you hear a BBQ loving dad? I hope I'm making sense...

Anyway, as for me, I "hear" the comment with an accent of your typical North American male in his late teens to early twenties. Michael Cera type. College level probably working as a food server (pizza delivery or waiter). Even after they reveal their age to be 60+, or their gender, or profession, I still hear it with this typical boyish accent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Filipino Mason residing in Toronto (also initiated, passed, and raised here but spent most of my youth in the Philippines as a DeMolay)

Masonry is big and commands a lot of respect in the Philippines. Most (if not all) of our national heroes were freemasons. Even the Philippine flag is Masonic (designed by our first president and zealous Freemason Emilio Aguinaldo). Masonry here in North America is more on personal building and philosophy whereas it's more about  brotherhood and charity in my native land. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was baptized as a Christian but I have a different take on the Holy Trinity. To me, the human being is the Holy Trinity. Each and everyone of us is a manifestation of the Divine Truth, a sleeping Buddha waiting to be awakened. 

(1) The Father metaphor is your guide- the nagging conscience that urges us to do the right thing even if no one is looking, it is your super-ego. 

(2) The Son is the material body that will eventually rot and decay. This material body, the id, has many wants and needs and thus very vulnerable to temptation (see: the temptation of Christ). Though the physical body seems to be limiting, it allows us to experience the creation or the universe.

(3) And finally, the Holy Spirit is the life force.

So no, the concept here is not 3 separate Higher Powers. I think the idea is to know yourself and unite all 3 and experience the Divine. </TEXT>

I'm not Hindu so please take this with a grain of salt... I just thought that the idea is that these multiple gods is just different representations of the Para Brahman (aka ultimate truth).

I don't know where you're getting your information from but you won't be able to build magnificent structures without the knowledge of Geometry. 

- "crafstmen were illiterate" 

Not because they cannot read means they don't know about proportions and cannot follow instructions. There's a reason for apprenticeship.  

The charges and lecture are everything you need because it will lead you to further studies and better understanding of yourself. All the history in the world such as the connection between monks and masonry will not mean anything unless you know yourself and you know what real charity is.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Brethren, I'm sure that all of us are intimately familiar with Ecclesiastes 12:1. Don't you think it would be nice to hear Mr. Jackson deliver those lines Ezekiel 25:17 style?

<TEXT> This post will probably not go anywhere but I secretly and sincerely wish that Mr. Jackson will somehow take notice. Mr. Jackson's most popular lines are laden with profanity (big fan here and I got nothing against that) but I wonder how he will fare when asked to deliver a somber piece without the usual dirty words (I love Ezekiel 25:17).

The following is a poem by Koheleth from the book of Ecclesiastes. The Book of Ecclesiastes itself was described by novelist Thomas Wolfe as "...the noblest, the wisest, and the most powerful expression of mans life upon this earth... the greatest single piece of writing I have ever known, and the wisdom expressed in it the most lasting and profound."

I have selfish reasons why I want you to pick this one but this is also relevant to Mr. Jackson's cause. I hope that we all, especially those who suffer from Alzheimer's and their loved ones, find wisdom in these words through Mr. Jackson's monologue. This poem is just perfect at 234 words long.

"Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them; While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain: In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened, And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low; Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets: Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern. Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it. (*the following line is optional*) Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity." </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are no "esoteric" explanations given because the journey that you're about to take is a very personal one. I agree that memorization is the key. Take for example the JW's lecture. We've all heard it as we pass through our Initiation but, unless you have a photographic memory, you probably have forgotten most of what was in that beautiful lecture. Take your time to memorize it, as you become more proficient with the memory work, you will notice that you're lips and gestures will be doing all the work without much mental effort- thus freeing your brain to contemplate on your life as you recite the words. I am not sure if that makes sense to you at all but I guess you'll get it when you get there.

<TEXT> Hmmm... It's been more than a decade since my last chapter meeting but I think I still know the main focus or essential teachings of DeMolay.
The 7 Cardinal Virtues of a DeMolay:
1. Filial Love
2. Reverence for all Sacred Things
3. Courtesy
4. Comradeship
5. Fidelity
6. Cleanness
7. Patriotism

I was Initiated, Passed, and Raised as a Master Mason here in Canada but I became a DeMolay and a "Knight" (Order of Knighthood - Thomas Michael Sherry Priory) in the Philippines. Young men take their DeMolay membership very seriously in that part of the world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm now based in Canada but I grew up in a small island province in the Philippines where there are lots of dogs without leashes and feral cats. Some of the houses there keep bucket right outside the kitchen door. This bucket is for collecting leftovers such as fish bones, entrails, spoiled rice, etc. And then people from pig farms collect the contents of the bucket as food for the pigs. The problem is stray dogs and feral cats also find the swill irresistible. Once a dog or a cat discovers where the bucket is placed, it will come back everyday and make a mess. To control the problem, housekeepers poison the animals by adding a very generous amount of MSG (Ajinomoto brand) into the swill.  It's a slow death for the animal.  This is common knowledge in my province that's why a lot of us do not use MSG. </TEXT>

You have 3 here which traditionally represents wisdom, strength, and beauty- but it seems to me that the wrong columns have been used (unless this is intentional)- on the background you have a Tuscan, and on foreground you have two Corinthians which support the sun and the moon. And what iss the significance of the Metatron's cube/Flower of Life's position next to Leo? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been a stay at home dad for more than a year now. I have an 11yr old daughter and a 2yr old boy. I don't like hiring nannies. I like gardening and cooking. Lately I have found love in cleaning and organizing stuff around the house. I don't drink. But I love smoking the sacred herb. I was a corporate slave before I decided to work fulltime on my website where I sell neckties (my own design). When I received the Registered Trademark of my brand, that's when I decided that I'm jumping into this thing full time. It was a very bumpy ride but things are starting to look real well (spiritual, emotional, financial) and it looks like I may be able to extend my stay as a stay at home dad- the job which I've grown to love. </TEXT>

I have 2 Freemason rings. My favourite is a cheap one that I got on eBay for 9 bucks. It's a perfect fit, looks nice, and I know I'm not gonna cry if I scratch or lost it. My other ring is a 1930's gold swivel ring that I got also from eBay for about 300 bucks- the thing that I like about it is I can hide the S C when I have to. I don't wear it as much because I don't like it getting scratched. I'm planning to buy a 3rd ring this time from Jems by Jem- most of the rings there are stainless steel working man's rings. Something that I could wear everyday even while working with my hands.  </TEXT>

1. Around 7am, a red car parked nearby and stayed there for about 12 minutes.
2. At around noon time, a man was seen by one of the camera walking towards the side of the house and he took something from the bushes. Somehow he was able to get to the side of the house while avoiding the camera in front.
3. This video that you see here. 

My theory is they could be trying to clone the remote keyless entry code either to the car or to the garage but apparently code grabbing have been obsolete since the 90's. </TEXT>

<TEXT> An hour with google and you will find most of the "secrets" that a Freemason have sworn never to disclose. A Freemason could care less if you are in the possession of a "secret" which you have obtained outside the Lodge. Freemasonry imparts knowledge through symbolism and secrecy itself is just one of the many symbols it uses. I hope I have answered your question. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks Bro. Don't really know what I was thinking... Must be a case of tunnel vision- I just read the part about the apron corner pointing upward/downward as indicative of a Mason's rank. I reacted right away by saying that not all jurisdictions practice this. Didn't read the rest of what you said. My bad.  </TEXT>
