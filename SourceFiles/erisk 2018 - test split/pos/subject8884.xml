<TITLE> Pro MUAs: Do you need a cosmetology license to volunteer? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-24 17:14:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My friends and I want to start a volunteer program at university to give makeovers to patients at the local hospital. I know that a cosmetology license is necessary if you're starting any kind of business doing makeup, hair, and nails, but does anyone know if this applies to a volunteering organization and not profiting? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah. I'm gonna get myself to my therapist again, pick up a hobby, and come up with better ways to keep myself focused and deal with my mental illness instead of letting it swallow me.

<TEXT> thank you. Sometimes I feel like most people here are only freaking out because they are used to complaining about their workload as a form of humblebrag- this weird, exaggerated facade that getting an A- is ruining their lives. Most of the people I know here don't struggle with mental illnesses and when I try to open up to them, they can't relate on the same level (like on this subreddit) and equate it to the humblebrag. There is almost never true vulnerability. 
I know people like me are out there, maybe eventually I'll find one of them </TEXT>

I've been bad at going to my therapist for the last few months (you have to call them every time to schedule an appointment. Who thought that was a good idea when a lot of the people who are supposed to be calling have severe social anxiety?). I know I should be going back though. Gonna book myself an appointment as soon as I can. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Most of the board games recommended here (betrayal, Eldritch horror, Dead of Winter) are referred to as "Ameritrash" games, as in they're big, garnish, usually luck based, and heavily themed. Their elements are used to create dramatic tension, to make you feel like every decision is big and important and make you win or lose. This is why they lend themselves to great co op, the sense of being a team with a single focus can heighten that experience. I think these are fun, but only when I'm with a group I'm really comfortable with. In general, I am more of a fan of Eurogames which run the gamut the other way - usually reward skillful playing, many interlocking game mechanisms, some to no luck at all, victory points as a measure of who is winning, no player elimination, and generally a pasted on theme. These games are all about elegantly and seamlessly threading mechanics into the core game. There are a lot of variables but none of them should feel heavy or overwhelming. Catan is a classic, and I really enjoy [Terra Mystica](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/120677/terra-mystica), [St. Petersburg](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9217/saint-petersburg), [Ora et Labora](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/70149/ora-et-labora).

2. N/A

3. Co op games are really fun! The couple of issues I run into with with co op games: 

*The "quarterbacking problem"-- If you ever play it with new people you're kind of forced into being the alpha-gamer, because there are optimal decisions that are obvious to you but unbeknownst to new players. Basically those who are too tryhard make the decision for everyone. [Hanabi](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/164236/witch-hunt) deals with well this by having hidden information.

*Elimination-- obviously no one wants to be kicked out of a game halfway through. Secret role games often suffer through this, but I think [Witch Hunt](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/164236/witch-hunt) does a fairly good job of keeping the roles interesting even when you're dead.

*Difficulty-- Hard to balance a game that works for all numbers of players. If a game says it plays 2-6, it shouldn't be impossible to beat with 2 and easy as hell with 6. Additionally, for some games you either lose near the beginning or steamroll so hard near the end that the last few rounds feel lackluster. 

Basically I feel like the annoying parts of something like Dota or Overwatch are the same things that ruin a co op board game, magnified by the anonymity of online play.

4. Four players is the standard unless each turn is shot (e.g. [Seven Wonders](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/68448/7-wonders))
5. I haven't played any :/
6. Around an hour of a really intense game or 3 hours of a more casual game
7. [This article](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/1268120#1268120) is one of my favourite things that summarizes board game design approaches.

You're an amazing guy who is hilarious and extremely kind and respectful to others and work well in multiplayer situations.

I guess the thing is to do collabs with a smaller group of people. But maybe there's not that many problems as there are only a few big group stuff on the server once in a while. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> That sounds like a good idea, but I don't know if Kurt is one to sue others... Etho seemed like the type who would sue the B-team for things they've done, while Kurt just looks like he would let things go. I feel like he wouldn't be able to press any hard charges, but that's just my opinion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This, my sir, is the best fan art I've seen for a long time.I laughed for an entire ten minutes.

The part that says "criticism" might be a little much though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Think of this as the "Beef has no legs" or "Pause is going on vacation" or "Nebris cheats" type of joke. It's a lore people joke about in good humour, but gets old after a while. Eventually it would start to die down. Plus, it's something even the Mindcrackers themselves are talking about, so the subreddit obviously hype about it ;-) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seeing stories like these posted always makes me feel all the feels :') I personally had been dealing with terrible depression for a long time and watching Mindcrack made me feel like for a brief moment, I'm no longer trudging through water and can relax and smile. These guys made me laugh more than I've ever had. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In Generikb's stream he mentioned that he, Btdubs, and Millbee played around together for a bit. I have a sneaking suspicion that it's yet another case where OOG(E) would be replaced with the B-team shenanigans. Personally, I love both groups, so as long as they do SOME type of co-op stuff, I'd be happy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The recent comments are probably reactions to other people suggesting versions of the Mindcrack logo pixelart and Bdubs saying that he hates it when other people suggest ideas to him that implies "I did it better". I love Bdubs but I think not only is he okay with a little criticism, being a YouTuber and all, but he also understands that most of them are good natured joking around. Understand that even the Mindcrackers themselves tease each other about these things. Just look how long the Pause on vacation or the Beef has no legs jokes have lasted. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I completely agree with the sentimental aspects of this. I've been watching Mindcrack for less than a year, but I came from trying to catch up with all the inside jokes to seeing new members join the team. The season 3 world is Mindcrack for me too. I'm very attached to the places and events that had happened in every corner of this world. However, I do feel that a map reset is in order. After all, the interactions are what make this a server instead of a singleplayer world. The dynamics of these people together are what I enjoy the most about these Guys. ;-) </TEXT>
