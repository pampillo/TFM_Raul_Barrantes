<TEXT> I call them voices, but really it's just me thinking the thoughts. I dissociate them to me because I can't control what it is saying or make it stop. So it's not like some morgan freeman is ranting in my head. I like to jokingly call it my inner dialogue. Movies actually portray the thoughts correctly but not the emotion associated with it. My head can say shit all day, but when it starts fucking with my feelings I know something bad is going down.

I was in the shower moments ago, shaving yknow. For some reason I thought it would be a great idea to run the razor across my face (which I ended up not doing). Also there was the cutest little frog in there :D. Today I seem to be very absent.. The voices are just very random not really relating towards anything. ON OTHER OCCASIONS they are usually very mean :(. Some real live quotes coming atcha "That dude is fucking ugly what a piece of shit." "It would feel so good to listen to him dying" "Can you imagine the blood flowing over your hands as you strangle the life out of them?" "You should rape her, she would probably enjoy it.". And when they concern me "You're a fucking psycho how could anyone love something like you?" "You know there is no hope you'll never be better" "You're fine there's nothing wrong with you stop being a pussy".  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like to think that reincarnation is real. Once we die we get reborn as a different person and sometimes dreams can be windows to what past lives were like. Over time your general personality changes and is morphed by certain things that happen. 

I also like to think that the universe is a huge ocean. Maybe we are just floating around on a tiny spick of sand in a huge ocean. Other planets are other little particles of sand, and somewhere out there, there are giant fish swimming around.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Social interaction is something everyone enjoys. If you are giving someone attention they will love it. Don't force it on them, but don't be too reserved. Try talking to strangers in public. Cashiers, waiters/waitresses, people that it doesn't matter if you come off as awkward or anything because guaranteed you'll never see them again. Simple stuff like "how has your day been?" is a good starter, ask open ended questions so they can give a chance to talk a lot about themselves, people love to talk about themselves. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But what is your definition of successful? If you think it is a slim chance do you have other options that you would like to follow? It sounds like you have a passion for flying, if the Air force doesn't work out, you should consider the navy. They have lots of pilots and I'm not 100% positive, but it's probably a lot less competitive than the Air force. Things take time. Don't be discouraged if they didn't work out the first time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hallucinations really range depending on how bad my anxiety or depression is at the moment. They can be anything from like little things moving around on the walls and floor to actual people. When I had made this post, I was going through a moment of increased hallucinations both auditory and visually. I saw things like a black dog in my mirror, I felt like I was being watched and knew something was in the room with me, a hanger I have with ties on it started shaking a lot. I heard doors closing, and people talking in my bathroom. I heard my name being called out a lot. Stuff like that. They can be and usually are extremely terrifying.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not belittling, perfectly normal question. I know its in my head. I don't think that would work. What you're talking about is how some people treat depression. Everyone who tries to cope with depression or suppress memories alone does it in a different way. For me in particular I was manifesting it in my head as anger and violence. Eventually building up to the point where it was comforting. Severe cases of depression could lead to other mental disorders which is what happened in my case. I took anti-depressants and they didn't work well, because by that point it was no longer just depression.  </TEXT>

If you have a friend you're worried about give them opportunities to do things invite them places and don't get upset if they say no. I don't want to generalize because there are different kinds of depression, and mine is very different from normal depression which it seems like you're aiming towards.

<TEXT> Hmm good questions they seem scripted... I'm open about my depression not so much the psychosis. Whenever I tell people I'm depressed I hate when they ask why, and I try to tell them, but then they start hounding me with life stories so they can try to empathize. It doesn't seem empathizing it just makes me feel like they don't care/want to talk about themselves. So don't do that, just listen to what they have to say. 

This question is cyclical. If I knew the thoughts that I had then I would have the thoughts that I have, so meeting me I wouldn't want to help me because it is someone else.

<TEXT> The fact that I'm still here amazes me sometimes, I tried to ignore or power through the things in my head almost my whole life up until a few months ago. When I started seeing help things got a little better, just opening up to someone was a huge deal.

For the second question I'm not sure if you mean in general or for some cases where it gets bad. So I'll answer both. 

In general just keeping my head off of bad thoughts. I have to constantly be aware of my thoughts and whenever I get negative thoughts I try to change the subject. 

For really bad days where hallucinations or voices are acting up, and just trying to ignore them not let them get to me. Reddit helps a lot for keeping my mind off of that when I'm alone. </TEXT>
