<TEXT> I think they should take ideas from all sorts of mythologies and incorporate them into new biomes. Like in Greek mythology, there are the fields of Asphodel, basically a huge Kansas field with black poplar trees growing every now and then. They could add some kind of Nether grass too and have lava lakes. And the black poplar trees could be fire proof. 

Obsidian spike biome would also be cool. As would something akin to the seven rings of hell.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm 20. I'm a virgin. Like, the furthest I've ever gotten was making out. And just with one girl. I'm looking for a friend. Like a real friend. Someone I can really get along with and talk to and stuff. But also is completely DTF. 

If there's one thing about me, I like to learn. I'm wanting to learn the ways of sex. 5'9", 185 lbs. Fairly athletic, but I've kinda let myself go lately. Not a bulky guy or anything. Not fat. Just got some extra doughiness. 

I'm a real optimist. Like, I'm one of those, "I'm just happy to be here!" Guys. If we can drink together, then hell yeah let's do it! 

I'd love it if we could actually talk about shared interests. Anything nerdy or movie related. Hell, if you're a martial artist, we'll have that in common. 

I'd like to discover myself sexually. If you're a college age lady in my area (18-23) and I sound interesting, PM and we can chat more. See what happens.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I too am in that boat. I definitely want kids someday. But I'm a 20 year old broke college guy. 

At the same time, my maximum amount of kids I think is 3. Two planned and one accident. After the third, either I'm getting a vasectomy, or she's getting her tubes tied. 

Also, as a side note, I think it's really unfair how little men get to contribute to the actual physical nurturing and development of a child. Yeah, we can help raise them, but the woman has to carry them for nine months going through all the shit of pregnancy. We men on the other hand say, "I helped! I was there for the fun part! Threw in some chromosomes!"

I wish that guys could like breastfeed at least </TEXT>

<TEXT> He's technically played two Templar Grandmasters in his lifetime. 

Of course he's playing Alan Rikkin in the upcoming movie. But before that he played Rodrigo Borgia in "The Borgias" series. 

I know the tv show has no connections to AC, but still, if you look at the show from the AC lore, then yeah, Irons has played two Templar Grandmasters. 

He did a fantastic job in "The Borgias," and I can't wait to see the movie. 

Also, don't spoil anything past Season 1. I'm starting Season 2 soon.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Geralt has accepted a new Witcher contract. He is to hunt down and kill a Xenomorph Alien. He can use all and every tool available at his disposal, but help from other characters is prohibited. And, for the sake of argument, we'll say the convergence of spheres simply dropped the Aliens into his world. So no firearms or nukes or whatever. Tools and magic from his world only. 

Round 1: a single Alien Drone. He must find a way to kill the creature. 

Round 2: he discovered a nest nearby a deserted village. Apparently the Xenos wiped out the inhabitants and are at risk of spreading further. He estimates roughly 20 Aliens plus a Queen. 

Round 3: another nest, but this time the Aliens have apparently spawned from other monsters. Werewolves, necrophages, Rock Trolls, Cyclopes, and Lesser Vampires. About 30 Aliens plus a queen. Geralt can enlist the help of the witchers of Kaer Morhen, Triss, Yennefer, Kiera, and Ciri.  </TEXT>

I know hoods are more of an Assassin thing than a Templar thing, but I wish we could have the option of adding a hood, like in your beautiful artwork. And in the trailer. The perfect mesh of Assassin and Templar.  </TEXT>

I feel continuing the franchise in that vein would have been spectacular. Still have him in the Animus for about 85% of the game. Get the amazing historical aspect. But the other 15% shows off his skills as he looks for the clues in the MD according to the info he found in the past.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been training for the last 4-5 years. I've gained some pretty neat athleticism. I only do bodyweight stuff and train martial arts. Of course it's important to always test your limits. So, I'd like a list of the most advanced/insane bodyweight exercises /r/Fitness can think of. I love muscleups, clap pull-ups, clap push-ups, handstand push-ups, and hanging sit-ups. Working on the Dragon Flag (getting there). Mostly I prefer the skill increasing exercises that could possibly help me in my martial arts training. I'm starting to run a bit short on ideas.

<TEXT> Little backstory: I dated a girl for 6 months last year. We broke up, but managed to stay best friends. 

Now, we have little siblings who are all 10 years old. I have a brother, and she has two twin sisters. Me and my friend always said after we broke up that we expect my brother to end up ironically marrying one of her sisters. 

One of the twins decided to message me on Facebook yesterday and asked what's up. My brother was in the room, so I snapped a picture of him and sent it saying, "Him."

"Who's him?" She asks. 

"My brother," I say. 

Now tonight, she messages me again, with a school picture of her twin that was edited on some iPad app saying, "This is _____. Do you like her?" She asked me to show that to my brother. I couldn't help but go AAAAAAWWWWWWW </TEXT>

Gave my family a big hug when we left and said, "We'll be praying for your safe journey home. Come back soon, sweetie pies!"

There needs to be more good people with a love for making good food in the world.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A judo throw hurts like a motherfucker. Especially when done quickly and efficiently, it can knock the wind out of you. As for the striking power, a bigger dude is tougher to ko, but usually a knockout is all about the precision of the strike and not the power. Many times have pro fighters knocked out their opponent and said it felt like they hardly hit them. I'm not saying she won't meet her match. I'm just saying don't count her out

<TEXT> Also, keep in mind though that despite her size disadvantage, the whole point of Judo (her base martial art which she won bronze in the Olympics) is to use your opponent's weight and size against them. A truly skilled Judoka like Ronda can throw anyone from any position no matter their size. A judo throw with near perfect technique should use almost no energy on the thrower's part. 

Once on the ground, a couple of precise strikes to the jaw will render the person unconscious. All she needs to do then is go for the kill.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, something like that happened to me. End of last summer before going into my senior year. Went on a kayak trip with my buddy. On the bus-ride upstream, his uncle let me sit next to him. I couldn't escape because it was the window seat. 

Turns to me, "Hi. I'm Uncle Jeff. Let me tell you what, my penis has gotten me into a lotta trouble over the years."

"Come again?" I said. 

"No I came too much, that's the problem."

Cue an awkward 20 minute bus-ride. My buddy was in the seat behind me laughing his ass off. His Uncle was giving me the full-blown (Giggity) sex talk! Gave me tips like "Use plenty of lube" and "wrap that sonofabitch up."

All legitimate advice, but WTF???? </TEXT>

<TEXT> He ended up getting cancer. 

He and my mom sat the three kids (me included) down last year. Mom said, "Your father has Hodgekins Lymphoma."

"What's that?" I asked, afraid cause I thought I knew. 

"It's cancer," he said, tears starting to form. 

The next three seconds dragged on forever. Little sister and brother started crying. I got a huge lump in my throat. Couldn't feel anything. Dad was wiping tears from his eyes, but wasn't outright bawling. 

"But it's very very treatable," Mom said.

"Should've started with that!" I said. I was worried for something very treatable. If you get cancer, you want Hodgekins Lymphoma. 

Next, the rest of my family said they were going to grandma's to tell her the news. Dad said that he'd probably be bawling there with her. Everyone went but me. I couldn't stand seeing my dad like that. 

He's better now. In remission </TEXT>

<TEXT> I honestly loved Heath Ledger. He really embodied what the Joker was. Not insane. Completely aware of his mental faculties. Yet truly believed society was some sort of disease. Something that needed to be destroyed. And the best way to do that? Turn it on itself. He believed society was one big joke. Something that only existed because people believed it did. Like a building built upon an unsteady rock. Just a slight gust can send it toppling over. "Madness is a lot like gravity! All it takes is a little push!" His monologues are some of my favorites.

<TEXT> I'm playing through New Story+... Or I was. 

As we know, we get to keep all the upgrades and goodies from the previous playthrough. I get to the point where you go to Founder's Island for the Blimps. I take out the nearby watchtower then re-obtain the RHD. I decide, "While I'm here, might as well take out the other watchtowers and sky drones." 

I decimate the watch towers and wipe out all the serpent drones. I come to specific copter drone who's light is trained on the rooftop of a building. Without thinking, I hit it with a disruptor round then walk into it's light. Malfunction. BOOM. No more drone. 

Skip ahead a bit. Get to the point where I'm about to take out the Arkham Knight's two radars. Hijack the nearby drone for the part to blind drones with the RHD. 

Fuck. 

Fuck fuck. 

God no. 

No. 

NOOOOOOOO!!!!!

The game requires me to blind the drone that is watching the Radar. The exact one I destroyed earlier. And I can't do anything now. I can't jump to the Radar. I can't blind a drone. I can't grapple. Can't use any other gadgets. I can only look onward at the Radar just [83 M] away and weep. 

I was 48% done with this playthrough. And now I'm sad.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, just a guy who likes things simple. I understand all that government does for humans. But it can only do so much. In part because we *believe* it has power over us. With our population the size it is, government is a good thing. But if our population stayed the size it was during the ice age, and we only had small tribes as a hierarchy, things would be much more simple than all this stuff we deal with now. 

No money, no crime. Any one does something that doesn't benefit the tribe? Kick them out! Let them starve! 

Everything about our society exists because we believe it does. In reality, those pieces of paper with historical figures printed on them mean nothing. Not worth anything. Gold too. And diamonds. It all has value because we believe it does. That's what separates us from animals. 

That could be a good thing. Or a bad thing, depending on how you look at it.

<TEXT> I'm thinking about really buying this card. I follow UFC news constantly. I always watch the free fight night cards and prelims. The only PPV event I ever bought was UFC 181. That was a pretty good night of fights. 

I'm probably going to buy this one, because I'm a huge Aldo fan and I'm upset that I missed Aldo v. Mendes 2 (I'm an even bigger Team Alpha Male fan). 

Not a huge fan of McGregor, but I definitely see why so many people like him. He's a very good talker. People love a great public speaker. He also has some serious skills to back it up. He's funny and entertaining inside and out of the octagon. I'm not sure if he'll win, but I think he's gonna give Aldo a much bigger fight than most Aldo fans are saying. He's very unorthodox and hard to prepare for, kinda like Lyoto Machida. 

But, I can't pick against Aldo. He, GSP, Jon Jones, and Demetrious Johnson I'd say are probably as close as it gets to the perfect fighter. Aldo is crazy. Throws crazy things. I have Aldo, but McGregor will be a motherfucker to put away.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not a debate on who would win. Let's assume Cowboy has won. How would the UFC deal with a champ who wants to fight on every other card? 

Cerrone would be a champ even more active than Demetrious Johnson. Would he really fight every other PPV event, either as Main Event or Co-Main Event? Would the UFC tell him to wait every now and then, which would clearly drive him crazy? Would he even consider giving up the belt so he could fight more often? 

And yes, this is assuming he can hold on to the belt for a while.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because Sony and Marvel Studios only recently were able to close a deal and I'm freaking psyched about it!

Marvel sold the movie rights to several of it's characters a while back. Sony got Spidey. 20th Century Fox got the X-Men and Fantastic 4. 

Fox and Marvel are still at odds with each other. And Sony seemed to be a likely candidate to sell the rights back to Marvel. 

After Amazing Spider-Man 2 tanked, Sony realized they were in some deep shit. So, they turn to Marvel to strike a deal. 

Sony: "We'll let you use Spidey in the Marvel Cinematic Universe if you lend us some of your producers for the standalone Spidey films because most of our films were "meh" except Spider-Man 2 with Toby Maguire. We still own the rights. He's still ours. You just get to use him however you want and we use your producers and tie it in to the MCU."

Marvel: "Deal."

Until recently, Spidey wasn't in the Avengers movie universe, even though he still is in the comics. Now that Marvel can use him and all the other supporting cast, they have a lot more to work with.  </TEXT>

Women, as soon as they get hit good once, get pissed off. I have yet to see a boring female UFC fight. The men most of the time try to get a feel for their opponent's style, and it takes most of the fight, and it can get boring. But the women go balls to the wall (ovaries to the wall?) and try to take each other's heads off </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, first off, that's not everyone in the UFC. The divisions for men go from Flyweight (125 lbs) to Heavyweight (264 lbs). For women, there are two divisions. Strawweight (115 lbs) and Bantamweight (135 lbs). 

If you from what you said, Lightweight (155 lbs) to Heavyweight, I doubt Naruto could make it out of the Lightweight division. You're talking about the division with 100+ fighters and that is arguably the most talent stacked. The longest any Champion has ever been able to hold on to his belt in that division is three successful title defenses. Only two people to my knowledge have ever even managed that. It's the toughest division to make a name for yourself in. You have guys like Gilbert Melendez, Anthony Pettis, Raphael Dos Anjos, and Donald "Cowboy" Cerrone in that division. 

Add in the four other divisions after that with guys like Robbie Lawler, Tyron Woodley, Chris Weidman, Anderson Silva, Lyoto  Machida, Anthony Johnson (Who is an absolutely terrifying combatant by himself) Daniel Cormier, Alexander Gusstaffson, Fabricio Werdum, and Cain Fucking Velasquez, Naruto doesn't stand a chance in the long run. 

If you want *Every* fighter in the UFC, he's even more fucked. He might be able to get through the female divisions more easily (he'll still take an ass kicking though) based on his possible strength advantage, but Joanna HowevertheFuckYouSpellHerName and Ronda Rousey would be motherfuckers to beat even if you're a man. 

Then you have to get through the men's divisions, and I'd say the lighter weight classes in general have far more talented fighters than the heavier weight classes. I wouldn't want to fight Jose Aldo or Demetrious Johnson after fighting everyone and their mother. 

UFC 10/10, 100/100, 10,000/10,000 stomps. Doesn't matter how many times he attempts it. 

TL;DR: A long list of some of the UFC's most talented fighters

Edit: Justus would be very difficult to deal with. But, a skilled enough grappler (like Ronda Rousey or Daniel Cormier) or a fast enough striker (like Demetrious Johnson, Anthony Pettis, or Donald Cerrone) could be able to close the distance to take it to the ground and submit him or knock him out, especially considering he'd be tired as fuck after fighting a shit ton of other talented fighters. Even the guys not in the top 15 of each weight class are in the UFC for a reason </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand the whole thing about having to pretend you're all right. It's part of the whole "be a man" thing. Even if you feel like your whole life is falling apart, you have to act like you've never been better. Gay, straight, or bi. If you're a guy, it's been ingrained into all of our heads by society to be stoic.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, that's exactly what I'm wondering, hence my question. Statistically speaking, the straight population outnumbers the GLBT population. So I'm wondering if those statistics might affect gay people psychologically if/when they break up. 

"I live in such a small town. I don't know if I can find someone else."

"I have no place to meet other gay singles in my area. Do I really want to leave him/her?"

Even straight people when they break up wonder if they'll find someone else for them. But the gay population is at a significant disadvantage.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you've ever watched the movies, you'll know that the staircases like to change. They'll rotate 90 degrees and reach up to a new platform. I'm currently trying to think of a way to achieve this with Redstone. I doubt I could get them to change at random intervals, almost like they have free will, but I figured I could use a pressure plate so that if you stand on it while climbing, the steps change. My biggest problem is figuring out how to get them to rotate 90 degrees. Does anyone have any ideas?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A few years ago, I started my freshman year of high school. I didn't know anyone in this school. I was in a classroom and some teachers were handing out schedules, handbooks, etc. 

The guy next to me says, "Hey, I'm Justin, this is DJ." He gestured to another guy sitting next to him. My brain turned off the moment he said the second name. I thought, instead of saying "DJ," he said something not even close in pronunciation. I assumed it was his nickname. 

TL;DR: "Hey Douchebag, I'm subject7254."

<TEXT> Taekwondo is a fantastic art. It teaches you timing and distance. It's also an art that forces you to be creative in competition. The flexibility you gain in your legs from doing Taekwondo would mix marvelously with Muay Thai. 

Also, there's less telegraphing in Taekwondo when throwing a strike. Almost every basic TKD kick starts from the same chamber position: raising your knee up. From there, you quickly position your hips to the technique you want to throw. Muay Thai kicks start from different chambers. So TKD is a much more deceptive art. 

The more you can confuse an opponent, the more the fight will go your way </TEXT>

One friend, for Christmas, I drew her a sketch of Hedwig the Owl (from Harry Potter. She loves HP) and framed it. She freaked out and it made me so happy. 

Another two (twins) were graduating this year, along with me. I got them big posters from The Hobbit. One was a Middle-Earth map, another was just a beautiful collection of characters. Same story, they freaked out and hugged me. 

Also, if I'm just hanging out with any of these girls, I'm always sure to get them a small treat, like ice cream or candy. Just so that I can see them smile. 

None of them ever ask me to buy them anything. I just like surprising them with something small or homemade to get that classic girl-freak-out-I'm-so-happy! reaction.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> You choose which character, which cheats to activate, etc. Must follow the rules of the cheats. Example: Invincibility lasts 5 minutes, and must be reactivated once it is up. 

List of cheats: 

http://www.cheatcc.com/xboxone/grandtheftauto5cheatscodes.html

The army of Mordor includes the Uruk-hai, wargs, trolls, Mumakil, and Sauron leading them. They have access to war machines such as ballistae, and trebuchets. Takes place at the Black Gate. 

Round one: Sauron without the One Ring, his forces containing 100,000,000 Uruks, and 500,000 troops split among the other assorted monsters. So a total force of 100,500,000 troops, along with war machines and Sauron. 

Round two: Same as Round One, but Sauron now has the Ring.  </TEXT>

You must raise them to adulthood, whatever that is for that species. Then you can keep them or set them free.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Can Gondor succeed in tearing down the Black Gate with an army of crack whores? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Gondor is attempting to break through the Black Gate of Mordor. Scouts have confirmed a copious supply of crack the Uruk-hai have been storing away in Udun for years and years. Gondor believes if they use an army of 3000 crack whores, telling them of *their Precious* beyond the Black Gate, they may be able to succeed in getting through the gate and taking Mordor. 

Mordor's forces: The 2000 Uruks on guard at Morrannon. They wield trebuchets and ballistae. 

Gondor's Forces: 3000 crack-lusted crack whores, each wielding weaponry which may commonly be used by a crack whore (broken bottles, coat hangers, trash can lids, lighters and flammable objects, etc.). 

Keep in mind Gondor wants the Gate torn down to allow the rest of Gondor's forces into Mordor. 

Is the crack whore army successful? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was talking to my friend. He says that Brock could count as black. Same with Iris and Archie. I disagree. Think they're all very very tan. Are there any canonically black people in Pokmon?

Edit: Thanks for the great responses guys! It seems to me for the most part, the people who could truly be considered to have African ancestry mostly appear in the newer generations. Just a trend that I saw. Not many mentions of people before Gen V. 

Adding on to this, I love the idea of the next region being based on Africa. Imagine the culture and landscape that Pokemon could draw from the continent. Have a desert that draws from the Sahara, have pyramids you can travel to and go inside. There could be Savannahs with Pokemon you need to chase down to battle and catch. A great rainforest. Travel along a river that spans the entire region. Then the Pokemon themselves could draw from the native animals and the native African cultures. I am in love with this idea! </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're right in that it doesn't affect the argument for it's legality. We would still have the same arguments. I'm simply saying that I don't know whether or not being sexually attracted to your own gender is a choice or not. Nobody really *knows*. It could be genetic, or it could be a subconscious psychological choice. 

I truly do believe that who you *love* is absolutely a choice. Whether it be Romantic or platonic. It's still love. It still means the same thing. Romantic love just has the added perk of sex lol. 

I love several guys. But it's all platonic. They're my boys. I love several girls. It's all platonic. They're just my friends. I'm *in* love  with one girl. God I wanna have sex with her haha. 

However, if gay marriage were legalized, I could just as easily choose to marry one of my bros, one of my female friends, or that girl I'm in love with. Marriage is a choice. Love is a choice. Sexual orientation is up in the air.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, I meant about choosing what you're attracted to lol. I'm not sure if people do choose that. They do choose whether or not to act on it. 

It's similar to how it's not illegal to be a pedophile, but it is to be a child molester. As long as you don't touch the kid, under the law you're fine. 

Right now, in most states, if gays got married somehow, it either wouldn't be legal or they would get in legal trouble. 

Besides, even as a straight guy, I can still look at a dude and say, "Man, you're not that bad looking. No homo." As in I can see aesthetically how women or gay men would find them attractive, though I don't myself </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Perfect Organism failed to scare an adorable 16 year old blonde girl last night. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-03 18:27:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> She's a very good friend of mine. We love watching scary movies together, so I figured I'd show her what it's like to be IN one. 

She's adorable, blonde, 16, and very sweet looking. 

I get to the point where you choose Crew Expendable, I'm like, "What mode should I choose?" 

She says, "Do Nightmare! Haha!"

I played one time, died, yelled, "Oh crap!" And she's just looking at me and laughing. 

Then I said, "it's different when you're the one playing."

She takes the controller, puts on the headphones. It's dark in the room we're playing in. She dies almost right after the first airway lockdown. Goes out the door and the Xeno is there. I tell her maybe she could throw a flare to distract it. Draw it into the room so she could make it through the hallway. 

Gets to the same point. Lights flare, door opens, couldn't figure out how to throw it (I didn't explain well enough lol) Xeno gets her. 

Third time, she goes through the hallway, nearly makes it to the second vent lockdown before the Xeno got her. 

Not only was she not scared... She was good. 

It was pretty attractive lol. She wants to play more. 

We're gonna start playing story mode together. 

TL;DR: Don't judge a book by it's cover </TEXT>

In his defense, my ex dated a lot of jackasses. 

We broke up, stayed very close friends. Possibility of us getting back together. He one messaged me on Facebook saying, "Don't give up on my daughter." </TEXT>

<TEXT> All three of my parents' children inherited great athletic ability from our father. Like, he could've gone pro in football, but ended up breaking his back in a game. He could've gone pro in baseball, but he married my mom. 

We all inherited our intelligence from our mother (she's a pharmacist). 

As for the fart gene, it's possible my sister inherited it from our grandmother. 5' 130 lbs. She blames it on barking spiders </TEXT>

Maybe in a few years when we both mature a bit. We both care about each other a lot, and I still find her insanely attractive. 

Today she changed her hair color. 

She was blonde. Now she's a red head.

If he killed me, I'm sure Goroth Man-Lover would have raped my corpse in 50 Shades of Grey fashion. 

Edit: First of all, it is not as amazing as I once thought. I confused this Uruk's name with a previous captain I killed right before him. I guess my sexy imagination made a false connection. Here's the link to the images.

<TITLE> Zelda U gameplay wish list </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ok, so seeing how they are making Zelda U an open world game (freaking awesome) I would like them to make combat a little more immersive than press B to swing your sword. 

I recently finished Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor. A Lord of the Rings game on Xbox One. It was open world. It had a combat system like Batman Arkham City. You press X to attack and Y to counter. The bow was brought up with L Trigger and R Trigger to shoot. Stealth is used by holding R Trigger and X for a stealth kill. 

Very simple, yet complex combat. It flows very smoothly. I would truly enjoy it if Zelda U had something similar. Make combat so smooth that you can take on ten Bokoblins at once. Go on missions that require stealth. Mess stuff up with the bow (or boomerang, bomb, etc.) easily accessible and thrown/fired the same way.

<TITLE> Feldush the Crazy almost caused me a lot of trouble today. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It may not seem relevant to this sub at first, but just read the story. It's pretty good and not that long. 

So, like, I cadet teach 2nd graders my last hour of my school day (I'm a high school senior.)

They were all still doing things for valentines day. One girl comes up and tells me they were all playing a game. They write something on two pieces of paper. The first one is something that makes you happy. The second is something that makes you sad. They put it in a box, draw it out, read it, and guess who it was. I said I'd do it. 

When I get to the sad thing, I couldn't think of something, so I decided to be silly and make them laugh. I said, "I get sad when that one weird Orc used to beat me all the time in my video game." 

They all laughed when it was read out loud. Someone asked, "What Orc?"

I said, "His name was Feldush the Crazy."

I kid you not that one of the little boys said this super loud: "Feldushbag!"

I looked away like I had nothing to do with this. 

TL;DR: A 2nd grader read my inner most thoughts about Feldush the Crazy </TEXT>

<TITLE> Who was the most memorable Uruk you've met in the game? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-10 22:52:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I met this one particular Uruk a while back. His name was Gham the Scholar. It was while I was hunting Warchiefs in Udun. Gham was a body guard for a Warchief I was hunting. I figured I needed to kill him to make killing the Warchief easier. So, I find him and we do our staredown thing. 

Now, as we are all aware, the Uruk always say something along the lines of, "Man Swine!" *Clash* "I'm gonna gut you to get a promotion."

Gham however said, "*GWAAAAH!*" *Clash* "Mgg... *MuwaaaaAAAAAAAAHHHHHHRRRRRGGGG!* Herm... Herm.."

He was one of those screamers. It was my first encounter with a screamer. I was taken aback. I paused the game once we disengaged and thought, "What the hell?" I remembered his nickname was the Scholar. Then it clicked. He's a moron! Who made him a captain? I ended up cracking up. 

My thought was that I really didn't want to kill him. I wished that I had the brand ability so I could make him a Warchief. Alas, Gham had to go. I killed him. Because someone as stupid as him surely would have messed up my assassination of the Warchief. 

Any other memorable Uruks? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've so far: 

-Thrown a captain into an abyss
-Eaten a captain with a Graug
-Raised an army of lesser Uruks and simply watched them tear a Warchief apart
-Put a Warchief against a Warchief
-Branded all the archers in an area and roughly half the lesser Uruks and started an all out war
-When I see an Uruk laughing about the kick a slave off a cliff, I sneak up and kick the Uruk off
-Set *EVERYONE* ablaze
-Poisoned *so* many captains
-Branded everyone in a fort then dispatched them. It was a flurry of exploding heads. 
-My crowing achievement: Stormed a Fort with a Graug, shot down all the hanging meat, dominated the Caragors, and shot down all the Morgai Fly nests. 

As you can tell, I enjoy Chaos. I find the game is just fun. There is an endless abundance of ways to kill Uruks and monsters. What is your most creative kill? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Before I went to church this morning, I made sure I had a couple of ones in my wallet for the collection basket. Collection basket came, put a dollar in. Easy peesy. 

I go to Walmart afterwards to get some stuff. Get to the check out. Look through my wallet for my $100 bill to pay. Had that $100 bill because my grandfather paid me back yesterday with it for buying some bleacher seats from my school for him. 

It wasn't in my wallet. Cue "Dafuq?" Face. I notice I had two ones but no $100 bill. 

You gotta be kidding me. 

Paid with debit card. Left Walmart. I hate ADHD. 

TL;DR: At least I'm going to Heaven...

EDIT: So, if you're here to comment and say that God isn't real, or religion is stupid, please kindly leave. Whatever you believe is fine. Not here to convert you. I'm fine with any of you being an atheist. I respect that. Please do the same for me. 

There is a difference between being Atheist and hating religion. Atheist means you don't believe in God or any gods. You choose not to believe in a supernatural force and instead accept science as the only reality. Perfectly fine. Many religious people, Christian or not, also believe in science. 

Hating religion is just that. Hating religion. It's being as closed minded as they accuse religious people of being. Going out of your way to convince people to stop believing in what makes them happy is not ok.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hitmontop in Omega Ruby has movement very similar to Capoeira. Capoeira is a Brazilian Martial Art that was developed by slaves when they weren't allowed to learn how to fight. So, the slaves drew from their African background and developed a "dance" instead. 

The dance involves many spinning kicks. The whole art revolves around spinning and circular movements. 

Just something very interesting I just noticed. Hitmonchan is based on a boxer, and Hitmonlee is based on a kickboxer. However, I never knew about Hitmontop's origins till just this moment.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I was over at my buddy's place, playing Alien. I got the short end of the stick and ended up having to test drive the new Nightmare difficulty setting. Well, after hiding in a room for about 30 minutes, I found my balls and entered the corridor. My friend said, "Pause!"

I pause. "What?"

"It's behind you."

"It can't be!"

"I think I heard something."

I heard nothing, and I had the headphones on set loudly enough that I could hear everything. And the room I'd just come from only had one entrance. Not even a vent. We all decided my friend was just paranoid. But I said I would turn around and check for him. 

I unpaused. Turned, and nothing. 

I turned back to the corridor. And...

THE ALIEN WAS RIGHT FUCKING THERE!

"Gotcha!" Says the alien as he chews off my face. 

There was no way the Alien could have been there. The corridor was straight and reasonably lit. No obstacles to hide behind. No vents. No other doorway. I couldn't even hear him approaching. 

My friends and I have come to the conclusion that the Xenomorph can teleport on Nightmare mode. It's the only explanation we could come up with. Can anyone else come up with a better one? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you! Some awesome tips here!

As for the lighter weight class fighters note you made, yeah, that is probably partially why I haven't developed that kind of power. I doubt I'm going to gain a whole lot of weight. I've been lifting intensely for a while, eating well, etc. still not gaining weight. Only power and speed. And I'm cool with that. I fight very well at my current weight. 

And yeah, you don't see that kind of power often in lighter fighters, but when you do, they're monsters. Cub Swanson for example. He's a UFC Featherweight. He's knocked someone out so hard the mouthpiece flew out of his mouth. Featherweight is 145 lbs, they usually cut 10-20 lbs. So he's roughly my weight and was capable of doing that. 

The way I see it, if I'm able to knock people out with my hands the way I can with my kicks and potentially my knees and elbows, that's just one more (or two, however you look at it) tool I have in my arsenal. 

Thanks again! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, TKD. However, I also look at how other arts implement their techniques and add it to my arsenal. Muay Thai is among them, as well as capoeira, karate, boxing, etc. I've been really working on my boxing lately. That's why my hand speed is so quick. I just need more power lol </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only knockouts I've ever gotten were via head kick. I've never done it, but I'm also certain I could knock people out with elbows and knees. 

I want to build that kind of power in my hands too. I have proper technique when throwing punches (but let's face it, it can *always* get better), I have very fast hands. I can land several punches in a row before jumping out of harm's way. But they lack a certain devastating effect that could end a fight. I've knocked the wind out of people before, but I'm just not certain I have the power I'm looking for yet. 

Any exercises for building that kind of power?

I'm 18, male. 5'8" 155 lbs.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm in love with the acrobatic techniques and am able to effectively use them in sparring (TKD). I need MORE!

Do you have any other examples of acrobatic techniques? Bonus points for an example video/gif.

Techniques I utilize often are the superman punch, jump back kick, exchange jump roundhouse, jumping roundhouse, crane kick, jump hook kicks, jump spin kicks, tornado kick, tornado back kick, flying knees, question mark kick, capoeira roundhouse, cartwheel kick, skipping front/roundhouse/side kick, and recently, I ended up using a spinning superman punch by attempting to set up a flying spinning elbow that I saw in a video. He moved to my left, so I extended instead of the elbow. 

I realize my list is extensive, but I would appreciate any new acrobatic techniques you may know of. I enjoy learning new things and figuring out how to apply them in combat. I'm especially lacking in acrobatic hand and elbow techniques, so those would be especially appreciated.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've got a good friend who, like myself, is a big Potterhead. She's 15, I'm 18. I'm trying to come up with an awesome HP gift to get her that'll blow her mind. 

Problem: she hates it when people spend a ton of money on her. So the gift needs to be inexpensive. 

I was thinking about a sketch (I'm a pretty good artist) of something from the HP universe. 

What do you think? Any other ideas? </TEXT>

<TEXT> People with Aspergers are not assholes. We can't help the fact that our brains were wired differently. It's like blaming a person with Down syndrome for being stupid. It's not their fault. 

Yeah, it's hard to empathize with someone, but part of it might come from simply not understanding why it's necessary. When I learned how awesome empathy is, I couldn't get enough of it! I felt connected to everyone!

I personally believe a true asshole is someone who chooses to be one. An Aspie was born with a differently wired brain. They didn't choose that. But, with encouragement from loved ones, an Aspie can learn how much fuller life can be with empathh </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've always found that sprawling and sinking in a guillotine is the best defense for the double leg takedown. That, or use the Bale Sacrifice Throw. When they go for the double leg, grab them around the waist, fall back, and use the momentum to throw them. Also, if you keep rolling with them, you'll end up in dominant mount.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> What is your specific fighting style? I'm not asking for the name of your art. I'm asking how you implement it in combat. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-24 22:42:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Example: The way I fight in Taekwondo sparring matches focuses greatly on the more advanced, unorthodox techniques. Jump back kicks, wheel kicks, wheel hook kicks, etc. I've also adopted different striking techniques from other arts. Cartwheel kicks, Superman Punches, etc. Pretty much those things that most people say are difficult, if possible, to use in combat. I fight like that because it works for me. And I've won several tournaments thanks to being unorthodox. 

Then there are other people in my Taekwondo organization that really focus more on hand techniques than kicks, even thought TKD is often known for its emphasis on kicks. 

I mean to say that every martial art has it's own style, and then each practitioner has their own adaptation of that style. Some block and counter strike. Some push the pace. Some constantly attack on the ground, keeping the person from doing anything but defending submissions. 

What's your sub style? </TEXT>

<TEXT> My grandparents visited Germany once. Said it was an absolutely beautiful country. The only problem was they were VERY strict about rules and social norms. 

Grandma and grandpa came down for breakfast in the inn, grandma picked up the knife and buttered her bread. She put the butter and knife in different places than they were before. An old German woman who she says to this day might be Hitler's sister came up to her and shouted in a *German* accent, "THE BREAD GOES HERE! THE BUTTER GOES HERE! THE KNIFE GOES HERE!"

Grandma nearly shit herself. It's one thing to be shouted at, but it's another thing when it's in a German accent. It's so guttural. It was a big culture shock for her.

<TEXT> I (18) went to Subway with my little brother (9) and my mother (none of my business). Brother orders a 6 in. Ham and cheese. I was feeling especially peckish, so I ordered two footlong steak and cheese sandwiches. 

Mom's turn. "Nothing for me."

Realization dawned on me at that moment of how expensive my order is. We're not poor. We're not rich. We're upper middle class. Still, two footlongs are expensive. 

In the car, I talk to her, I say I'm sorry. I essentially took my mom's dinner from her. All because of my bottomless pit stomach. She said she was fine. Happy that I was full, but shocked that I could eat that much. I feel horrible :(

TL;DR: I took two feet from my mother.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good questions. The way I see it, I'm *using* my impulses. I learned to control them in this regard. And really it came down to the training. The muscle memory I developed. 

Most people's reaction when they see someone throwing a bunch of fists at their face is to cover up their face and back up. That's their impulse, whether you have ADHD or not. I sucked at first. Like everyone does. 

I am a very physical learner. I know if I'm doing something right if I can *feel* it. It took a lot of training to get to the point where, when someone throws that left jab, I move my feet to the left, center block with my right hand, and counter with a left of my own. The first time I did it correctly, I was like, "I felt that!" 

Yeah, I would sometimes run into the punches, but every time I sparred with a partner, I got a little better. I was rewiring my brain to only follow the good impulses. The split second decisions that let me get out of the way. I wish I could do that with my mouth lol. 

The twitch of the muscle is something I noticed after a fair bit of practice. I thought, "So if that muscle twitches in that direction, then he's throwing this strike. So what do I do to avoid it?" 

I would analyze it. Just like how in a classroom setting, while the teacher drones on and on and on, that mechanical pencil beckons to you. "How does it work?"

After analyzing this-this-this-this, I would put it into practice. I would never think this during sparring. I would be thinking about it after classes. Usually, I remember very few details about my matches. What I do remember, I analyze the shit out of. 

The hyperfocus comes into play during sparring. Usually, for me, my brain skims over all the info around me until I find something very interesting. A person kicking me in the head is pretty interesting lol. Keep in mind I'm also medicated, so I have a degree of control over my focus. I can narrow it to where I'm analyzing everything about what I choose, if that makes sense. 

I'm constantly moving, so I'm using this extra energy to be evasive. It's only when I don't set my feet right that I slip. 

It's not that they're the opposite of what the symptoms are. It's looking at the symptoms in a different perspective. So often, people think about the negatives of ADHD. But there's good and bad in everything. It's how you look at what's been given to you that defines you </TEXT>

<TEXT> I use my ADHD to my advantage in a huge part of my life: martial arts. 

ADHD is possibly the perfect thing for a combat athlete to have. I have Inattentive/Hyperactive-Impulsive ADHD. The Inattentiveness actually works well when I'm fighting. 

We all know how it is. Our focus is constantly shifting from one thing to another. We notice the tiniest details about everything. Well, it's surprisingly easy for me to focus during a fight because of all the stimulation going on. My focus is on my opponent. All of him. I notice things that others simply don't. I notice the way their body moves saying they're about to throw this kick, or this punch. I notice the twitches of their muscles saying they are going to initiate an attack. I notice their eyes dart to my head telling me they're going for a head strike. 

The hyperactivity helps so much in sparring as well, simply because I have an incredible gas tank. I'm constantly moving around the other guy, not breaking a sweat because I'm so used to constantly moving. 

The impulsivity means I have good reflexes. It's just a matter of training my muscle memory to do what needs to be done without me thinking. Using my impulsivity to react faster. When I fight, I never remember anything that happens. My brain simply works too fast. 

ADHD can be a tool. You just have to find how it works for you.  </TEXT>

I'm a martial artist myself. I love everything about it. Watching the females train is a bonus. 

A while back, I showed my ex some basic techniques because she was curious. She was having a lot of fun with it. I had a boner the whole time. Good thing it wasn't Jiu Jitsu I was teaching her. She definitely would've known then, and maybe a little weirded out (we never had sex). 

I think part of it stems from me being in love with both her and martial arts. The two of them together= insta-boner </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very interesting questions my dear internet stranger, lol. 

First one, about the literal interpretation. I was born and raised Catholic. I believe in God. I believe in Jesus. I believe in the Holy Spirit. However, I did a lot more thinking about my religion than the rest of my class (Catholic School) did. In fact, between preschool and 8th grade, when the priest came in for religion class, I would always ask the most questions. The rest of the class would just read from the book and nod. The priest once told me that no one else in the class could seem to follow my train of thought on matters of morality, faith, etc. He could, because he heard most of my questions before, but some even stumped him. 

My Catholic school was very open to the idea of discovering your faith. Yeah, there were the religion classes to help with that, but they also had books in the library on things like Greek, Roman, and Egyptian culture. I was fascinated by these books because they were so foreign to what I was taught, yet so similar. 

I have a very good sense of self. And I've discovered that, yes, I believe in the Holy Trinity. I believe that God the Father is Love in it's purest form and that Love is what created everything (but not in six days. I'll get to that later). I believe Jesus is Love incarnate. Jesus came to help give humanity a push in the right direction. I believe the Holy Spirit is the Love that we feel towards our fellow human beings. I believe the Holy Spirit is what gives humans hope. Gives us joy. Gives us a sense of what's right and wrong. 

However, I recognize the fact that science is true. But honestly, I see no reason why science and religion can't be friends. In fact, science is just our way of understanding the world God gave us. We're all human. We're all curious. We want to know more about nature. When humans study the world around them, they are learning more about God. 

I realize that Love is a series of chemical reactions in the brain. That doesn't mean it's not real. In fact, there's your confirmation of Love. Love does exist. Therefore, God exists. Because God is Love. Love is what makes the world we live in a little better. Imagine if we couldn't Love. Life would suck. It would be truly meaningless. People are constantly searching for happiness. That happiness can be found in Love. If it makes people comfortable to not think of Love as God, then fine. As long as you're living a life of Love, however, in my book, you're living the life God wants you to. God wants you to believe in him. In Love. 

I don't believe God created the world in six days. However, since God is eternal, six days in his time could seem like several million years to us. I believe the timeline of the universe is accurate. I just think God is manipulating everything behind the scenes. Example: Big Bang meant God decided to set up fireworks to celebrate the creation of a new world lol. 

He manipulates these parts of nature, but gave living creatures free will to choose. So he might make that hurricane happen. But how we respond to it determines what happens next. Humans can shape history just as much as God can. 

So, I do believe in some parts of religion literally, but more like the philosophical parts. The "science" of religion was something I had to discover myself. 

As for me being the person I am without religion, I am not so sure. The most liberating moment of my life was realizing that my choices affect who I am. I made all the wrong choices when I was younger. I was a very troubled kid. Depression, Anxiety, ADHD, and Asperger's syndrome. I couldn't feel emotions very well. I was miserable all the time. I nearly committed suicide in fourth grade. 

I would love to tell you Jesus came down and sat next to me and told me everything would be ok. He didn't. I was truly miserable. I cried out, telling God to take all the pain away. I shouted out that I only wanted a friend, for it was something I didn't know anything about. 

I got my first friend two weeks later. She was so patient with me. She helped me through a lot of stuff. It was about my sophomore year of high school that I realized, "Holy crap, God gave me her."

My faith had a big influence on me growing up and developing into who I am. I always believed in God. I just thought he hated me. But now I've grown a lot closer to God. To Love. Because of all the shit I've dealt with. I don't think I could've psychologically made it through my childhood without having something to believe in. 

TL;DR: I say the word Love a lot. Also, fuck depression </TEXT>

<TEXT> Those people that never heard of Jesus could have been amazing people anyway. They could make it to Heaven. So long as they live their life of Love (man I sound like a broken record lol). Jesus has some good teachings. Love everyone. Well, these people in America could have figured it out for himself. From what I know of their myths, for the most part they had a code of morality similar to the one Jesus taught. Maybe God did reveal his Love to them, but in a different way. Not through a preacher, but through their experiences.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe it stems from fear. People are afraid of the unknown. That's a part of human nature. So how do you make it familiar? You come up with an explanation. They explained the forces of nature with personifications, or gods. 

These explanations later made them think, "Maybe if we get on the gods' good side, bad things will happen less often." 

Thus began the practice of sacrifice. Also, the moral code began to develop. Humans naturally have some level of morality. But these religions gave a little more structure to it. Societies with similar morals would survive longer. Subconsciously, humans realized this. 

These beliefs began a long game of Telephone. Details were added in and taken out. Add in the different languages and several thousand years, and you have a mess of religions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's because they realize that God is a benevolent being. Yeah, horrible things happen. I believe God causes them to happen. However, I don't believe it's simply to be malicious. I think it's because he wants to bring out the best in people. If we were handed everything, there'd be no reason to strive for greatness. 

Let's think about that doctor doing the surgery. His life might've sucked. He could possibly have lost his father to heart disease. Maybe this spurred him to be a cardiologist? He spent countless hours studying in college. It sucked horribly. Lost so much sleep. His roommate kept him up all night with the girl he brought over. He failed some tests. Maybe some more deaths in the family. Maybe some heartbreak. Maybe he was so preoccupied with his studies he had no time for heartbreak. 

He goes through so many trials. Probably much worse than what I'm saying here. But it's all worth it. He saves this kid's life. And it all started with his dad's death. 

I think subconsciously, the people in your area realize that God is responsible for the bad things that happen, but these bad things can lead to the good. It all depends on how we as humans choose to live our lives. That doctor could've just as easily given up on his life and been a bum. But instead he persevered. God has a plan for everyone. It's up to us to decide if we want to follow it </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see nothing about hate in that quote. 

"He who does not gather with me scatters"

"He who does not gather with Love scatters"

I interpret this as Jesus using the word "gather" kinda like a farmer gathering the crops. Crops are good things. People are the crops. Gathering people to live a life of Love by showing them kindness, and not shoving it down their throats. "Scatters" is like when you do shove it down their throats. People GTFO. Or when you are horrible to people. You psychologically affect them to the point where they might just give up on a life of Love </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's also the philosophical side of religion. That is somewhat of a science. What is the best way to live life? My answer to that is with Love. Just be a good person. Don't hate on anyone. Let them make their choices. Make your own. And when you mess up, learn from it </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you! The extremists aren't real Christians. I have no idea how much I've said this in this thread lol, but you're a real Christian when you love everyone. We are all sinners. We mess up. It's part of human nature. The thing is that you become a better person when you acknowledge you messed up and try to do better. And I'm pretty sure Jesus said, "Be tolerant of everyone" </TEXT>

<TEXT> My belief of God and Love being synonyms fits very nicely with this. Loving God can simply be by loving everyone, because you're living the life God (Love) wants you to. 

I'm not sure if Jesus ever said anything about enemy. That implies hate. That's definitely the opposite of what Jesus preached. 

"Anyone who isn't for me is against me" can be rewritten as "Anyone who isn't for Love is against Love" </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe actions speak louder than words. If someone sees you being an awesome person, they'll think, "OOH! I wanna do that!" That's probably the most effective way to get "converts." Let them choose for themselves. 

More than once, I've thought, "There should be a Church called *Our Lady of Be a Good Person and Do Your Best*. Forcing your beliefs on someone alienates them. Being a good person is contagious. 

As for that last paragraph of yours: I personally love the idea of loving everyone. That includes gays. Discriminating against people isn't what Jesus asked anyone to do. Whether they think people should be aloud to have a gay marriage, that's their opinion. Keep it to yourselves. If gays wanna get married, whatever. I just won't get a gay marriage. Just cause they're gay doesn't mean they're a bad person. 

I personally believe abortion is stupid. Whether you believe the embryo has a soul at conception or not, no one can deny that an abortion destroys something that could've been a human. In my book, that's just like murder. Birth control I'm cool with. But once the egg and sperm meet, I think that baby has a right to live. 

That last point about education, look up on Askreddit that one thread from a few days ago. It's about people who were in cults. It's very interesting. You're right. Some people just were uneducated because their religion forbade them from learning.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Completely right. These beliefs evolved over many years. I accept that. That's why I personally take my beliefs from all the sources I can find. A lot of influence comes from my Catholic upbringing. Like the thought of God being synonymous with Love. So I prefer to believe that Heaven is more of a state of being after death. Like the soul is at peace because that person lived a life of Love. Hell is choosing hate over Love, thus the soul isn't at peace. 

I love the idea of Jesus's original teachings. Love everyone. This is psychologically healthy. And if it turns out there is an afterlife, I choose Love, just like in this life </TEXT>

<TEXT> I won't lie: I'm not big on going to church. The point of Church is to worship God. You can do this simply by living a life of Love. I previously stated that Christians for the most part believe God and Love are synonyms. So it's technically possibly to be a good Christian by living a life of Love. The life God wants you to live. No Church necessary. So even an Atheist could make it to Heaven if they lived that life of Love because you're doing exactly what God wants you to. Of course, the Atheist would go, "Oops." Upon reaching Heaven, but so long as they're a good person, no harm done </TEXT>

<TEXT> ??? Is there a religion that actually says sinning is ok if it's under God? If so, you're right. That is ludicrous. 

The definition of sin is a choice of action that rejects God. It's impossible to sin under God simply from that definition. 

Also, sin can be defined another way. For the most part, Christians believe God is Love. The two are synonyms. So sin can be defined as rejecting Love. Anything that doesn't spread Love or that furthers hate is sin.  </TEXT>

I've gone through some real shit too. I nearly committed suicide in Fourth Grade. Was bullied my whole life. Anxiety, Depression, ADHD, and Aspergers Syndrome diagnoses from a young age. 

I've dealt with the only two loves I've ever had deciding they don't want to be with me. I've seen my dad suffer through cancer. I've lived with guilt. I'm only 18. I know it's gonna get worse from here on. 

But making the most out of your difficulties gives you the chance to say, "Suck it Life!"

ADHD? Joined martial arts. 

My only two loves decide they don't want me? Decide that I love them enough to want them to be happy. 

Dad has cancer? Remember all the awesome things he does for me (Plus I can get him stocking caps for Christmas) </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are a lot more similarities between the different religions and science than you are letting on. I love looking at all religions and piecing together the similarities. Example: Judeo-Christian tradition, Greek/Roman myths, ancient Egyptian beliefs, most other mythologies, and Science all agree on one thing: the universe was created from nothing. That, or from Chaos. 

The Big Bang brought Order to that Chaos, God created everything from nothing, Gaia arose from the depths of Chaos. 

If you put in the effort, you notice many similarities. Most mythologies have a story reminiscent of Noah's Ark. And I believe I read somewhere (don't have the source) that science agrees there was a dramatic flood at some point in the Earth's history. So clearly this flood must've been something serious that people are still talking about it. 

Even if you don't believe in these religions, just doing the research is interesting in and of itself </TEXT>

Example: My dad was diagnosed with cancer a few months back. My mom said, "This made me remember how much I love your father." You go through daily life, thinking, yeah, I love my SO. But that was a push to get her to really remember everything he does for us. Plus, he's almost cured now. So this has given him the opportunity to say, "I kicked Cancers ass!" Lol </TEXT>

<TEXT> She saved my life. 

I suffered from severe depression and anxiety, as well as ADHD and Asperger's syndrome, though we didn't know about the latter till a year later. 

I was in fourth grade, and after being bullied horribly for a good portion of my life, I was home alone one day. I went into the kitchen, saying I was gonna cut my throat with a knife. 

Didn't go through with it for whatever reason. Ran to my room, cried. Prayed to God, "Why are you doing this to me! I hate my life! I just want a friend."

Two weeks later, this girl in my class sits down next to me while I'm reading Harry Potter and starts a big HP conversation with me. I'm startled she's talking to me, but whatever, she'll leave soon. 

Same thing happened over next few days. I ask why she's hanging around me. 

"I want to be your friend stupid," she said with a big smile. 

She remained my best friend even now that we're seniors in high school. She helped me deal with a lot of my issues with Aspergers, like teaching me social stuff. By being my friend, she gave me a reason to live. 

I got a crush on her in fifth grade. Realized I loved her by the end of eighth. I stayed in love with her till a little over a year ago. I loved her for eight years. I still love her, just not *in* love with her. 

We've already decided we're not ever gonna stop being friends. We never dated. She currently has a boyfriend. And I'm happy for her. She's my best friend.

Keep in mind I have Aspergers Syndrome and ADHD. When I was 5-6, it was particularly bad, and I wasn't on medication and hadn't even gotten the diagnoses yet. I sat on his lap, noticed the elastic holding the beard to his face, and ripped it off. Shouted, "YOU'RE NOT SANTA!"

TL;DR: Made a bunch of kids cry in the mall, and I believe I saw tears from Santa as well </TEXT>

<TEXT> Earlier this year I was in a martial arts tournament. In my fight, I used a kick called a wheel spin kick. It's essentially a jumping spinning kick that lands with a heel to the head. The guy backed up, front kicked up the middle. The force of my spin combined with his kick equalled immense pain. Ref stopped the fight to let me recover. He looked at me and said, "I know you're not ok, but are you ok?" 

Thank God for my cup. I finished my fight and won my division in the tournament. 

TL;DR: I got power-nutted and dropped like a sack of potatoes </TEXT>

<TEXT> A little over 3 years ago, freshman year of high school, I started martial arts training. It has absolutely changed my life. I had very little self esteem (though more than I had in the early years of my life) and martial arts gave me a ton of confidence. 

Of course, we all have to start somewhere. You're not gonna go to one class and suddenly be Bruce Lee. It takes time, effort, and practice. It's a fantastic way to fill your time. It's somewhat addicting. 

You get fitter, you learn self defense, you have fun. It's awesome. Plus, sparring sessions, whether you do a striking art or a grappling art, boost your confidence. Something primal about combat that all humans understand and get an adrenaline rush from.  </TEXT>

I hadn't played the game in years when last year my little brother comes up to me and tells me how awesome he is at Yu-Gi-Oh! I laugh, dust off my old deck, and promptly annihilate my brother. 

I started helping him build a better deck, decided to collect some of the new cards myself. In one booster pack, the dragon was there. I say, "Dafuq is this?" Do my research. Very rare copy. 

Edit: Galaxy-Eyes is also a very good card. Hard to summon, but once it's out, you essentially dominate most people </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sometimes flashy works very well. Capoeira is far flashier than TKD and is very effective. Many people that I've fought in TKD don't often use the flashy stuff because it does sometimes leave you vulnerable to counterattack. I personally love the flashy stuff. I'm good at landing the flashy techniques and have a good idea for my range. You see Olympic TKD fighters use these advanced techniques because they're very technically sound with the basics </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know where you got the lack of hand strikes idea. We work on them almost as much as kicking. 

Yes, there are complex advanced kicks, but they all stem from the basics that you learn in Muay Thai: Front kick, roundhouse, side kick, back kick, axe kicks, cresant and spin kicks. 

You learn the basics, then when you've got them down, you learn the advanced stuff. The advanced kicks are somewhat applicable in MMA, but yes, unless timing is right, takedowns will be successful. Really the advanced stuff are used more for conditioning. If you pull them off in a sparring match, extra points. 

Great for developing speed and power. Learn to react and counterattack effectively. 

The list goes on and on </TEXT>

<TEXT> Take out the knee. YouTube search the front kick. It can be angled at the knees, body, or face. However, without proper training, body kicks or head kicks aren't a good idea. However, if you take out the knees, you disable their movement. From there, you can run away, or you can jump on them and attack the face. 

If you're anticipating a fight, I suggest training martial arts. Taekwondo is a fantastic striking art and Judo and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu are great arts for throwing and submission holds. If you can find a Sambo school, even better. Sambo incorporates both. It's like Russian MMA </TEXT>

<TITLE> Stories about playing with friends? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-02 03:05:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I figured I'd share some of our stories. Big wall of text ahead. 

1. First time we got together to play, I never saw any of the movies, so I asked my friends to give me info on what we're up against. They told me what they knew about the Xenomorph anatomy and the owner of the game explained that it's impossible to kill the alien. You can only hide and pray. 

I decide to watch my friends first, each falling (in survival mode) to the Xeno. Keep in mind I just watched my friends die before my very eyes. And I realized: I was next. I was going to die. Like everyone does in this game. 

I start my turn. I hear the Xeno's cry in my headphones. I freeze. I say quietly, "Oh God." It heard through the mic. I heard footsteps. "Oh God." Closer. "Oh God." Closer. "OH GOD!!!"

It looked like the scene from the first movie where the tail dangles down then you see it's face. I saw it's tail in my peripheral vision and turned in time to see it's little mouth. We all promptly screamed then laughed. 

2. My friend was playing. He hid in a locker. He used the motion tracker and saw the alien was nearby. Then we see it walk in front of the locker, and we could see from it's waist up to its head. My friend forgot to hold the "Hold Breath" button. 

It stops straight in front of the locker, turns slowly, and looks directly at it. Our hearts stop. It rips off the door and guts my friend. 

3. Keep in mind this shape of the vents. 

0--|
     |
     |
     |--0     0=vent entrance. 

My friend uses the motion tracker and sees it's nearby, so he jumps in the vent here: 

0--|
     |
     |
     |--0 x     X=friend

And makes his way here:

0-x-|
      |
      |
      |--0 

And uses the motion tracker and realizes the Xeno is patrolling the outside near his current location. He backs up to here:

0--|
     |
     X
     |--0 

And uses the tracker periodically to keep track of the Xeno. Clearly the alien heard the beeping because we immediately see this:

0--A
     |
     X
     |--0       A=Xenomorph

Cue the pause button and us shouting and saying, "Oh, God, God, God!" My friend said, "I'm so dead guys." We spend ten minutes on pause. Five freaking out, five formulating a game plan. The plan was to bring out the flamethrower as soon as it was unpaused, shoot, and GET THE FUCK OUT! Here:

0--A
     |
     X
     |--0  lt;----- GTFO Spot

Then we spent the next 2 minutes reviewing the exact combination of buttons to press. It works, he hides in a locker, for 20 minutes, saying, "I really don't want to move."

4. Last story: I was playing, I hid behind some boxes near the door because the tracker said the Xeno was near. Seconds later, it walks in the room, completely ignoring me, back almost turned to me. I pause. All of our faces look like:
O_o and :O and a combination of the two. 

We come up with my game plan. Very similar to before. Bring out flamethrower, shoot, run to the nearest locker. 

Everyone counts down, "5! 4! 3! 2! 1!"

"I don't wanna!"

Everyone counts down, "5! 4! 3! 2! 1!"

I unpaused, shot, and through the flames, the Xeno's face appears. We all scream as the little mouth takes a bite out of me. 

Funny thing was, I don't think he would've noticed me if I hadn't brought out the flamethrower. When I brought it out, his face appeared like, "GOTCHA!"

Those are my stories with friends. What about you guys?

<TEXT> Considering WWE is choreographed, I'd probably use my Striking and Judo/Jiu-Jitsu experience. I'm a much better striker than grappler, I'm much lighter. Use my evasive footwork to stay out of his range and counterattack. Shots to the liver would be devastating. Once downed by a good liver shot, I'd either throw as many punches to his face as I could, or if he gave up back control, try to sink in a rear naked choke. 

If he tried to go for the double leg takedown, I'd do one of two things: either knee him in the face, or sprawl and sink in a Guillotine choke. 

If he managed to take me down, I'd close up my guard and attempt a submission. I'd say that armbars, kimuras, and omoplatas might not be as effective because he's much stronger, so a Guillotine or triangle choke might do it. 

I'd do my best to keep it off the ground, but if he took me down, I'm confident in my submission skills

Edit: Also leg kicks. Kick the shit out of his legs to reduce mobility </TEXT>

<TEXT> Keep in mind all the people who care about those people. The kids might get kidnapped. If they survive, they have the opportunity to grow. If they die, more than likely they're going to Heaven. Either way, their parents, family, and friends also have the opportunity to grow. 

Those born mentally retarded... Have you ever met people like that? They're usually some of the nicest people. They're suspended in childlike innocence forever. Like a really young child. Young children that only seem to know Love. Their families and friends struggle with their disabilities. They also have the opportunity to grow. 

My parents were probably just as miserable as me while we dealt with my depression and Aspergers and ADHD. Now that I'm no longer depressed, and my Aspergers is under control, they're filled with such relief. They're the best parents I could ask for. They've grown from the experience as well. Considering I'm their first child, they weren't expecting any of this at all. It's been a positive experience in the end. 

God doesn't create misery. Love provides opportunities </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember hearing about a theory about parallel universes. I believe it applies to this concept as well. The parallel universes are shaped like planes, and every now and then... *boop!* 

The planes touch for a very brief time, therefore allowing interaction. I'm sure something like that does occur. Just enough for God to influence an event and set a chain of events into motion. 

I also think of the Old Norse view of the cosmos. There are nine realms. Midgard is earth, possibly the rest of our universe. Helheim is Hell. Asgard is the realm of the gods (or God). And there are other realms like Alfheim, Vanaheim, Jotunheim, and I believe Svartalfheim. They're linked together through the branches of Yggdrasil, the World Tree. These worlds are separate, but connected. Because they're linked, our souls may move on, possibly not physically, to these other realms. 

Asgard means our souls are enveloped in God's Love. Helheim means we rejected his love.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really use Jesus and God as synonyms. Jesus is Love incarnate. 

I've noticed when you discuss religion with some people, they're more willing to talk about God than Jesus. They might shut down when you talk about Jesus because, historically, he was just a man. So the fact people worship a "regular guy" makes it sound like a cult. 

So I prefer talking to people when they ask about Christianity about God. And really, if I mention Jesus, I'll just summarize the bulk of his teachings, "Do your best. Do your best to be a good person. If at times you fail (and often you will) that's fine. Just never stop trying." </TEXT>

<TEXT> There isn't any evidence. It's impossible to use evidence from our plane of existence to prove or disprove something from another plane of existence. Which is why science will never prove or disprove God. It's a matter of faith. 

People choose to believe for comfort reasons. That there is someone out there that loves you unconditionally. That you don't really die. 

If people choose not to believe, that's fine. As long as you live a life of Love, you're going to Heaven anyway.  </TEXT>

But I wouldn't change anything about it. I believe those horrible experiences helped to shape who I am today. God doesn't just make you an awesome person. He lets you choose to be one. He gives you crap to deal with because he wants to see you succeed by yourself. And that is Love </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, in Heaven, you're not really praising some old guy. God has no definite form. He's pure spirit. Most Christian denominations teach that God is Love in it's purest form. So when someone is worshipping God, they're worshipping Love. If someone is living a life of Love, then they're living the life God wants them to. 

Heaven is that connection you have with God (Love) at death. If you've accepted Love by the end of your life, you're at peace. You're in Heaven. You're rejoicing in God's Love with everyone else who has accepted it. You're seeing your deceased relatives and friends you've missed so much. Making new friends. And just happy. It's like a new relationship. Super exciting and makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. That's my understanding of Heaven. 

Hell, on the other hand, is when someone rejects Love. They choose to hold on to anger, and hate, and hard feelings. Their soul stays that way after death. God doesn't send people to Hell. They send themselves. He wants nothing more than for everyone to make it to Heaven and enjoy Love, but people have to make that choice. Yes, he could make everyone accept Love, but then it wouldn't be real. It's like your mom telling you to love this girl because "she's nice," and yeah, she may be, but your mom forcing you to date her makes the feelings false. God needs us to choose his Love for it to be real. 

As for what Hell is... If you've ever experienced depression, that's a good analogy. It's like depression on steroids. Your soul has rejected Love, and now lives in hate, wrath, and sadness. 

The afterlife is a reflection on how you choose to live your life, and whether you decide to do your best to choose Love. It's a state of the soul, not necessarily physical places. I've always viewed Christianity more as a way of life than a religion. The major thing they teach is Love. Do that, and you'll be fine. Doesn't matter if you've never set foot in a Church. Doesn't even matter if you killed 1000 people and are about to be executed. If right before they zap you, you feel true remorse for what you've done, try to put yourself right with Love, you're gonna be in Heaven. 

TL;DR: I'm a philosophical 18 year old who should be asleep and who studies many different religions and the philosophies of Christianity and have described my beliefs on the Christian afterlife, taking much from Catholic doctrines.  </TEXT>

Figured it was time to share this story on the Internet. Back in the summer before my Freshman year of High School, I loved watching funny YouTube videos. Sanity Not Included was one of my favorites. Being an immature and dumb almost-freshman, the series appealed to all of my comedy interests: vulgarity, sexuality, awkwardness, and things that I didn't really get, but laughed anyway because I felt I was supposed to. 

There was one episode where the dialogue goes:

"What's that sound?"

*shows another character* "Well it wasn't me drawing Hentai and vigorously masturbating... Just saying."

Hentai? What's Hentai?

I was fresh out of Catholic School mind you. Still very naive to the ways of the world. So I turn to my old friend Google. He has all the answers a young pubescent moron could want. Ranging from: "How do I ask out a girl?" To "Funniest cat video ever."

I type in Hentai, and up comes cartoon porn. 

"DAFUQ!!!" I shouted. 

I had never seen porn before. Believe it or not, I just didn't see the big thing about it (at the time). 

First porn I ever see are gifs of Danny Phantom getting it on with his sister, and some weird Japanese chick rubbing her penis. 

I exit out, run to the shower, sit down in the running water, and cry, "Not clean. Not clean."

TL;DR: Was stabbed in the back by my close friend Google and my Catholic upbringing. TIL that Google is Judas.  </TEXT>

My friend was wanting to know if you were in any relationships at any point with your fellow cast mates. 

My question: since you were a star in one of the world's biggest franchises during most people's most phase of life (age 10-21), what things did you do either during filming or behind the scenes that makes you cringe to this day? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Me and my friends have a fantastic memory of playing that together. We turned the lights out, and played it around 10:00 PM. I went last. I saw each of my friends die before me. The thing about the game is that you know you're gonna die. You don't know when. You don't know how. But it's gonna happen. 

Watching my friends die and knowing what was coming made my heart pound against my chest. I heard the Alien. I say "Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. OH GOD!"

It hears me through the mic. You see a tail swing in my peripheral vision. Next thing I know, I'm impaled by that tail and me and all my friends are screaming and laughing. 

It really looked like something from a horror movie </TEXT>

This is a link to an AMA I did a while back for adults wanting to know about my previous experience with depression. I haven't felt like this in years. Yes I've asked myself why I feel this way. Nothing. Zippo. Zippidy-doo-da. No idea. Constantly bored with life. Not to the point where I'm considering suicide, but I just don't feel good.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes demonic entities can possess the human body. However, I don't think it's that they are controlling you. The three stages of possession are 

1) infestation 
2) oppression
3) possession

Infestation means the demon becomes attached to you. Oppression is when they wear you down emotionally and spiritually. Possession is when you do what they want. However, I don't think they are forcing you to do anything. You still have your free will. It's just because of the Oppression stage wearing you down so, that you give in to the temptations of Satan and his demons more easily. If you've ever heard accounts of possession and Oppression, you'll notice they're depressed severely </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think Satan's a deity. He's a fallen angel, therefore immortal. However, he has no powers that a deity possesses. He doesn't manipulate any part of nature. He doesn't even have the power to make humans do evil things. He just whispers in your ear, "You should get back at Phil. He keyed your car. What are you waiting for?"

Edit: This is from my comment later in the thread regarding possession

Yes demonic entities can possess the human body. However, I don't think it's that they are controlling you. The three stages of possession are 

1) infestation 
2) oppression
3) possession

Infestation means the demon becomes attached to you. Oppression is when they wear you down emotionally and spiritually. Possession is when you do what they want. However, I don't think they are forcing you to do anything. You still have your free will. It's just because of the Oppression stage wearing you down so, that you give in to the temptations of Satan and his demons more easily. If you've ever heard accounts of possession and Oppression, you'll notice they're depressed severely

I would add to this that people who are depressed (which I have experienced) are somewhat more prone to misbehavior. Worn down spiritually and emotionally to the point wear you give up on what's right and wrong. There have been cases where someone possessed had told the demon to leave and, in the ensuing spiritual battle, the demon does leave, defeated.  </TEXT>

Don't get me wrong. She's a family friend. She's so nice. I just hate the sound of her voice. She sounds like Female Squidward. 

She asks me very personal questions too. Things I just don't want to talk about. So normally I give one word responses and she just drones on constantly.

<TEXT> I currently train Youn Wha. Thing is, Grandmaster Han's Organization quickly became a McDojo. He started taking most of the money for himself. So, several Masters, some I trained with personally, each started their own organizations. They split off from Grandmaster Han and called themselves different Organizations. Traditional Youn Wha, Youn Wha Ryu Federation, etc. I'm with Traditional Youn Wha. All the sister organizations still get together for tournaments and stuff though. 

As for the training, it can be very effective. I'd say the training is roughly 75 % Taekwondo, 24 % Judo, and the other 1% is split between Hapkido, Jiu Jitsu, Kung Fu, Aikido, and Karate. It's certainly a mixed martial art, but it's not MMA training if that makes sense. 

The sparring is point based. Kicks to side of the head and body, hand techniques to the body only. You wear gear like you see in Taekwondo in the Olympics. 

Going with Grandmaster Han's Organization would mean your school isn't as well funded. The sister organizations provide better funding and overall better teachers I'd say. The Masters in charge of Traditional Youn Wha draw experience from training with other schools too, then come back and teach their students what they learned. Like, 4 times a year, Royce Gracie comes to the St. Louis area and teaches BJJ. The masters go and any student is welcome to learn as well. These masters went to Las Vegas earlier in the summer for the martial arts expo and trained with all sorts of people from the UFC. 

You must learn forms to advance in rank, but, even though most people say forms are useless, and they are not my favorite part of classes, they do help you learn control. Help you put that punch or kick exactly where you want it. 

It's a great style, as long as you pick the right Organization. Been training for 3 years. I mostly refer to it as Taekwondo, since that's what most of the classes consist of. However, the higher in rank you get, the more grappling is involved. Also, just like any other martial art, the only way to get good at it is to keep it up and do your best.  

TL;DR: I've trained Youn Wha for 3 years, I love my specific organization, a lot of people, especially the instructors, can really kick ass, but be careful about joining Grandmaster Han's Organization. Stick to the ones that split off </TEXT>

<TEXT> Technique really is the biggest thing I'd say. The better technique you have, the more efficient you are with your movements. Strength training helps build up the strength, but using it in a technique requires training. 

I remember reading an article (don't have the link) where Georges St-Pierre said his Muay Thai coach was overweight, smoked like a chimney, had a poor diet, etc. His coach could still kick the crap out of him and all the other students. It was because he was efficient in all his movements </TEXT>

One of my classmates worked at the local Walmart. She was a cashier. One day, the Nazi was in Walmart wearing a large coat. She thinks, "Oh no. It's him." He comes up to her at the register and whispers, "Hey! Psst. Wanna buy a VCR? I got VCR's in my truck." She politely declines. 

He reaches into his coat and she thinks, "Oh no, he's got a gun."

He takes out a bar of soap and throws it at her. "Fine! I don't want your soap then!" (To be honest, I'm not sure if it was soap or not. It's been a while since I heard her tell the story. It might have been gum or something, but I do remember it was a ridiculous object.)

He runs off. Security runs after him. He beats the crap out of them. The cops show up, he beats up two cops while being tased. The taser doesn't even faze him. 

He's eventually subdued and I believe he's currently in prison

TL;DR: crazy black Nazi tried to sell VCR's, threw soap, beat up security and two cops, taser energized him, Hulk Smash, is currently in prison </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seriously, Xenomorphs from the *Alien* franchise are weird creatures. I'd like to discuss biological aspects of their existence. Such as: if they never eat their prey, how do they acquire energy to metabolize? Why do they kill just to kill? 

Any questions you've asked yourself about the Aliens but never thought of an answer would also contribute to the thread.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been getting into Judo for the last 6-8 months. I have a training partner at my TKD school who had some experience in Judo before. Mostly what we do is we get to class an hour early and have our own "class". Just us, practicing Judo takedowns and ground game. Something awesome that he did (that I get a kick out of) is he made me a *syllabus*. He found this video (http://youtu.be/J6xiq-RKhCg) that has all the most common takedowns and went through it and wrote the Japanese name of the technique and the English translation, as well as a short description. He also marked what time in the video each technique is at. It's a fantastic video. Check it out </TEXT>

<TEXT> It really does depend on the school. But also depends on yourself. 

My TKD school has some younger kids. But it also has a bunch of teens. Kids 14-18 years old. Also this one guy whose 39 who has the HARDEST elbows out there. 

Most of the time, we spar people our age/height. You'll see these kids who are 7-11 years old really going at it. The teens (myself included, as well as the 39 year old most of the time) push each other VERY hard. We all have our own styles of fighting that we developed sparring each other. 

One girl always blocks and counters. A guy is a pressure fighter. Always comes at you and rarely takes a step back, and utilizes punches more than kicks. Another girl fights similar to the guy: applies pressure (while throwing in spinning elbows). The 39 year old is very calculating. Then there's me who circles opponents, constantly switches between orthodox and southpaw, applies pressure and a fast pace, and uses flashy unorthodox techniques to catch people off guard. 

We don't spar soft. We don't pull punches because we realize that we're taking away from each other's training when we do. I can't remember the last time I left a sparring night without an injury of some kind. 

TKD is a fantastic striking art. The problem you faced is finding training partners to push you to your limit </TEXT>

<TEXT> The worst kind of boner (or best, depending on how you look at it) is the kind that ache. Like it's almost painful so much blood fills the penis. It throbs, your mind is full of testosterone. The testosterone fills you with so much passion that you feel you will die if you don't release. You start looking at every girl you see. It doesn't matter if you're absolutely in love with someone. The lust doesn't mean that you love them any less. It just means you have a hunger that needs to be filled. 

Something that I read somewhere on Reddit described men and women's views of sex/orgasm pretty well. For men, it's like eating a big steak. For women, it's like enjoying a chocolate Sundae </TEXT>

The way the body works comes pretty easily to me because I've learned about it in martial arts. I'm probably gonna go to school any way for the backup plan. But I'm still gonna find a proper MMA gym as well. Was planning on getting a few pro fights while still in college to see where it takes me. If I ended up in a big name promoter before I get my degree, I'd probably quit school and train full time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think of professional mixed martial arts as a way to better yourself in your combat skills. Nothing like a competition to bring you up to that next level. Not only that, it's a very controlled situation compared to street fights, where it's very possible someone could die. In the cage, you can fight knowing that the referee will stop things before it gets too crazy. 

I believe the only times it's acceptable to fight are for competition or self defense. Outside competition, everything should be done to avoid a fight. 

My draw to it is the rush and unpredictability. When I fight in very heated point sparring matches, I feel more alive than ever, and it is somewhat safer than cage fighting. I just want to see what I'm made of, if that makes sense. I will NOT be one of those disrespectful fighters. I will be the guy who's exciting to watch, kind to everyone, and a great sport, like a true champion should be </TEXT>

<TITLE> How can I change my parents opinion about me fighting professionally? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-27 20:38:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Background: I'm a high school senior, training Taekwondo for 3 years, last six months I've been practicing more Judo/Jiu-Jitsu as well. For about the last year and a half I've been looking at how strikers from other martial arts throw their techniques, and integrated it into my Taekwondo point sparring. As a result, I've become a very good striker in my organization. Won my division in several tournaments. People always come up to me after I fight and say they really enjoyed watching me, said I did crazy stuff, etc. 

My grappling is coming along very well too. It's very different from striking, but just as much fun. It's my dream to fight MMA professionally. Anytime I fight, I get this huge rush. I love everything about martial arts. Not only am I a good fighter, I'm really good. I think it's something I could do for the rest of my life and make a living at. Maybe even end up in the UFC. 

Problem: My parents don't want me fighting professionally. They want me to become ANYTHING else. I'm a straight A student, top 10% of my class, and could probably get into almost any college I wanted to. I've had enough of school, it's boring, it's too easy, I've already got a few college credits under my belt from dual credit courses. Each of them, more A's. 

I'm thinking I'll go to college just to make my parents happy, but at the same time train MMA and get a few professional fights to see if it's really what I want to do. If I'm making good money fighting, and I keep winning, I'll chase my dream. 

My parents don't really approve of the plan at all. The say, "God gave you all those brains, and you want to go get concussions?"

I just have no idea how to convince them. I don't want my relationship with them strained because of my dream. I've been asking them to let me do ANY kind of martial art for as long as I remember. When I was a little 5 year old, I would ask them to let me do Karate. I've wanted to fight my whole life, before I knew about MMA. It was only 3 years ago, when I was about to turn 15, that they said yes finally. I haven't regretted it. But they see the difference (and so do I) between Taekwondo point sparring and MMA cage fighting. Taekwondo has the chest protector, forearm/shin guards, etc. MMA just has gloves, a mouth guard, and a cup. 

They don't want their son getting hurt, like all parents, but it's what I want to do and it's what I love. I understand all the risks involved. But my dream is my dream. Do you have any advice for an aspiring future champion? </TEXT>

<TEXT> As suggested by a Redditor, the rule is changed to include any G rated movie

EDIT 2: Producers of Disney, you sick bastards. I CAN'T believe how easy it was for all of you to do this! I mean, I could see a few movies being dark, but there are ones I've never heard of, and ones that I've always loved even now as a high school senior, if only for the great stories. 

I am especially appalled by the fact that Simba screwed his half sister. Thank you Reddit </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've practiced Taekwondo for three years now. I've got a reputation among my organization as an unorthodox fighter, even for Taekwondo. Flying, spinning, jumping kicks is part of the advanced curriculum. I've been looking at other martial arts, grappling and striking alike, for more ideas for things to practice and use in sparring situations. I've taken a liking to the Superman Punch and Cartwheel Kick. I've used the walls in class to jump off and land punches and kicks. I want to learn more though. Can you give me the name of a crazy unorthodox striking technique for me to practice? If you have a link to an instructional video, that would be amazing. Thank you :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> She broke up with me about 2 months ago. Said that we'll try to be friends. Like real friends that hang out every now and then. Not the "yeah we're friends, but we never talk" friends. 

After an awkward 2 weeks of barely talking at all, we start texting again. Like every day. For the next month and a half up to the present. Snapchat too. Tag each other in Facebook posts. 

When school started up again (we're in high school), we started hanging out in person again (she went to stay with family after we broke up, the reason for all the cyber communication). The breakup wasn't ugly at all. It's complicated. We both admit we're still crazy for each other, and we both agree that some day we'll get back together. Just not now. 

Things feel exactly like how it was during the relationship. The only difference I see is that we no longer kiss. We still cuddle when we watch movies or if she's cold. We give each other hugs. We flirt a bunch. Just no kissing. 

Me and my (ex?) girlfriend are bad at breaking up with each other.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So my friend brought up a very good point. I thought you all might have good opinions. He was watching X-Men 2 when the woman with Wolverine's powers shows up. Somehow his mind wanders to virginity and he thinks, "Is it possible for her to lose her virginity?"

His logic was that since her regenerative healing repairs any damage to her body, that would most likely include breaking the hymen. So she would never be able to lose her physical virginity. Thoughts?

Btw, I hope I picked the right subreddit.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I will admit, on the scale of the kind of stuff I've seen on here, this really isn't that big of an FU. In the moment, however, it was the worst thing I've ever done. 

So, I had a long day. What I really needed was a hot shower to relax. I was showering, feeling good. The hot water running over my skin. I felt a pressure in my lower abdomen. The familiar fart pressure. I decide to release. 

At the moment I released, intense pain shot to my butthole. For that split second, I believe I felt what it must be like to be anally probed. I nearly ripped my butthole apart. My rectum spread and stretched before slamming shut again. As for my cheeks, if you played it back in slow motion, I believe it would look something like a horse's lips flapping. The pain subsided very quickly, so I went back to enjoying my shower. 

For anyone who has farted in the shower before, you'll know that every now and then, you'll smell it, and it smells way worse than normal. I have no idea about the chemistry involved (if someone would explain it to me, it would be appreciated.). I think it has something to do with the water molecules bonding with the fart molecules and the steam lifting it up. 

What I smelled... Was something akin to absolute, concentrated death in its purest form. My first thought was, "Oh, God! What have I done??"

Second thought, "*THAT* came out of my body???"

Now, thirty minutes later, I can still smell it. 

TL;DR: nearly ripped open my butthole and smelled Satan's nuts.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Difference between being a fighter and being a martial artist? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I have a brown belt in Taekwondo and am starting to really work on my judo and Jiu-Jitsu. I'm a big follower of MMA, and I've noticed that some of these fighters are just that: fighters. 

I believe there is a major difference between being a fighter and being a martial artist: a fighter knows how to beat you up. A martial artist will only beat you up in competition and do everything to avoid violence outside of it.

<TEXT> Gals, your cramps, tampons, and bleeding is over, but you have no idea whether or not you'll get pregnant. 

Guys, your "manstrating" will of course vary from person to person as it does with females, and your cramps are constant blue balls, but, hey, more worry free sex if you find out your body's rhythm. 

EDIT: for guys, orgasm feels exactly the same as regular ejaculation </TEXT>

<TITLE> TIFU by taking my medicine. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-07 14:11:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Literally just happened. First off, I'm a 17 year old male. Second, I have to take medicine in the morning before anything. Well I was off work yesterday, so I slept in. Took my medicine later than usually, about 11:30. Couldn't sleep well last night, about 3 1/2 hours total on and off. Woke up about 6:30 this morning for work (feeling like crap I'm so tired), took my medicine, started making breakfast. Then my boss calls two minutes later saying I didn't need to come in today and we'll work tomorrow. I work on a farm, so the weather determines if I work normally. Last night it rained horribly and still is. 

Here's the fuck up: my medicine is a stimulant. So I won't be able to sleep until it wears off a LOOONG time from now. Nothing disgusting or cringeworthy, just a sad 17 year old who won't be able to sleep. 

TL;DR: Took my stimulant medication late yesterday morning and couldn't sleep well last night. Woke up early for work today, took medicine only to get call from boss that I didn't need to come in. Now I'm tired, very sad, and will probably spend today Redditing.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Edit: These are some good responses guys. I totally get wanting to be leaner for fight day. I always had a problem with fighters dehydrating themselves, taking the biggest dumps of their lives, etc. though. I mean, when they step on the scale, they don't look healthy. And I think they aren't even really a 155 lb fighter if they cut 10 lbs to make weight. They're just pretending to be one. I also get cutting 2-3 lbs if you're barely over the limit, but it gets ridiculous. 

I'm an aspiring fighter, and I've already promised myself that I'm going to fight in my natural class. 155 lbs lean </TEXT>
