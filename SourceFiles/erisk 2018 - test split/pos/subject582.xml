<TEXT> I know what you mean. People just call them bad because they're not exactly the positive experience that we have on our best trips. They can get bad for some people. I, for instance, was experiencing sensory overload for about an hour, but what seemed like forever, and it was pretty scary. 

But like I said in my other comment on here, the thought process after is extremely revealing. I realized how I felt must be how a person with extreme Autism must feel all the time. That said a lot to me about other people's experience that I have none with.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm happy you've taken precautions on all those measures. Young teens shouldn't have all that free reign. 

I know it's probably not looking the best from your POV, but believe me when I say it's not unusual at all. Some kids and teens just need someone there not only as a friend but to supervise. You could also think of it as a tutor when he works on school work. 

I'm no expert OP, but I wish you the best and highly suggest reading and researching up more on current and future diagnosis's of his.

<TEXT> I'm sorry that this is happening to you, OP. Consistently unruly kids are never easy for anyone.

First off, take this kid to get some counseling. It can save you years of emotional and financial damage this kid can do when he grows. 

Why does he have a cell phone? Get rid of it when he's misbehaving. Get rid of his video games if he does something he's knowingly not supposed to. I grew up without the luxury of these things, and as a 21 F, I'm fine now. 

Think about getting a babysitter, even if you don't necessarily need one. Some kids feel they relate better to teens/young adults than to actual adults, and it could change the moods of things; you could have more free time and he will be monitored. 

Get locks on your fridge, freezer and pantries. I once had a friend who's family had to do this because of their weight issues. These things can't be opened without a pass code, that you should NEVER tell him. You're not starving him, however he needs to learn about impulse control. This has worked out well for my friends family (except for my friend, who now works as a mechanic's apprentice and buy's all the junk food he wants outside of his home, unfortunately.) 

Lastly, OP, lay down the law. I had a tough, old-school dad growing up. And in many ways, I appreciate it, because I learned to be a self-sufficient, healthy person. He was not the nicest most times, actually, and had a very condescending demeanor. But he made sure to let me know very sternly whenever I wasn't doing something correctly, wasn't going to get something I didn't need or was acting like a child. Maybe not in the right ways, but he did. Basically, don't be afraid to play the bad dad, but don't be a dick or abusive about it. He needs you to do this and you need to do this.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, disease thanks to the disgusting Europeans that came over. This is coming from a Cherokee who has much family in the Tribe in North Carolina. Almost nothing before the settlers came had been affecting the tribes. 

The term genocide usage was correct. The damage physically and with intent done by the pilgrims and settlers were malicious and COMPLETELY done on purpose. The majority of the white men and women tricked, lied to, stole from, raped, killed, and belittled any native in their way.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A man tried to lure me into his car when I was 4 or 5. My dad came out of the building shortly after, luckily. He was a 30 year old dude in a business suit and a nice car from what I could tell. We're both white.  He looked ordinary to me. 

I learned then that monsters are everyday people.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was 4 a man tried to lure me into his car. I was outside an animal shelter, near a semi busy road. The man was about 30 and I could instantly tell he wasn't trying to help me. I was saying no, but he wouldn't leave me alone. Luckily my dad came out and the guy drove off pretty damn quick. 

The world changed for me that day. Nobody had to explain anything to me. The world and men in general just because a lot darker after that, and I knew I had to watch out for myself.  </TEXT>

Exposure to radio frequency (RF) radiation has climbed rapidly with the advent of cell phones and other wireless technologies. Studies of the link between exposure to RF and to electric and magnetic frequency (EMF) radiation have found RF and EMF to be potential carcinogens, but the data linking RF and EMF to cancer is not conclusive. **World wide, health physicists (scientists who study the biological effects of radiation) continue to study the issue.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> My grandfather was adopted by white people because his birth mother, a Cherokee, passed giving birth to him. He was put in a boarding school. He became an alcoholic sometime in my mother's early childhood, and when she was in college, he and my grandmother split. He finished off doing great after he settled on the rez, where alcohol is prohibited, for damn good reasons. 

I now live with an alcoholic mother who is falling apart at the seams after  living through a lot of shit, especially because of how things were left for her native elders. She's done a lot of work for the tribe and wall street in her life.

So, does it matter? Think about how the dots connect. At the end of the day, nobody really knows the half of it when they think they do. This is why I continually give a shit about other people, no matter who they are or when their kind suffered, because in a way pain is like energy, it can't be created or destroyed.

And white people suck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, because more effort could be put into working with those tribes they have done wrong. Building stronger relationships with leaders worldwide is what should be done, because "reservations" still aren't really ideal, and never were. 

If I saw more government subsidies go towards tribes for compensation generally, it would make up for past mistakes, awful laws made, loss of land to settlers AND allow tribal leaders to decide how the money is distributed. Which would be used for spending most likely on funding for education, infrastructure, etc.

Also, you are just so wrong about the last part. I'm a Virgo, buddy. Sincerity is like white out on paper to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depression makes us really incapable of what we used to be capable of. Believe me. This work overshadows completely what actually defines you. Fuck a grade. 

It's not you, it's that society is really really bad at finding out how to deal with us, so they toss us into the same mix of other kids without mental health issues who can move at faster paces, do more work etc. This isn't what the world should be doing, if you ask me. I think universities should have separate, slower-paced programs. Not dumbed down, however, because we are intelligent. 

Depression should be an excuse for someone to leave their life and just go far away, from needing a degree or a job and just go. </TEXT>

Nobody could convince her to change and the only thing that seemed to stop her was when I was ten and switching the vodka with water. Tell her to stop. She needs someone to make her stop before she's sucked in too deep to listen, please. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They will accept it. It's sincere, and sounds like it's coming from the heart. They want to know you want to come back and they want to know you want to change and make yourself better. This happened to me last year, and my essay looked a lot like yours. Here I am, chillin the weekend before finals. 

By the way, I went from a 0.0 GPA last year back to getting A's and B's, one year later after a medical leave. Thank you, 225mg of Venlafaxine daily.

Also, throw in some things about how you were before the depression happened, if there were better times and better grades (I'm sure there were), and relate that to what you want to do in the future.

Random things that help my severe depression that I never thought would help: Positive notes to myself in a place where I can see them. One says, "Breathe. Drink water. Rest." Whatever helps you man. Every day is an achievement so keep going. 

I also had to add, message me if you'd like whenever you feel like going over the edge. I can help you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi to all. Please take the time to read this.

I'm not from Cherokee, but my roots are. My grandfather resided there and passed in 2009. I have many fond memories of the Eastern Band of Cherokee. I spent a lot of my childhood exploring the reservation, the Cherokee river, watching the casino in progress, and many others.  

To anyone bothering to read, I have been to this park as a child more than once. I have seen these conditions and remember leaving with a pit in my stomach every time, like I left that (or my heart) behind in the zoo. I'm going to try to find petitions to start or find links to but...

PLEASE please thumbs up this!! 

The news NEEDS to be spread as we are a rather quiet and not media-centered tribe. However, we are one of the only tribes with a semi-strong economy, and we can do much than this treatment with our resources, and reddit's help, if the people want a zoo.  </TEXT>

"i don't feel like i have chronic depression"
^buddy, you really wouldn't have a clue if you did or not. Believe me.
You sound like myself, life story wise. 19F. 
Dude, don't sit at home, that's the worst thing. I never do. Do you have a car? I drive around and smoke weed a lot, stay at my boyfriend's, friends houses, or just myself. Don't be afraid to walk around your town and ask about jobs if you think you can handle a second one (it's less free time, but it's something to do with benefits.)
I'm sorry buddy. I went through so much like you did, I was diagnosed MDD last year and doubted I was depressed before that. You gotta get used to solitude because a lot of people just don't know how to do that, and don't even try until they get out of bad places in life. What do you like to do? Can you afford to pay for a few community college classes? Just try to do whatever you can to have yourself juggling. You'll get back in the swing of life and you'll feel better. Reconnect with a few old friends, sometimes the best ones may have been trouble in your life, for whatever reasons, but a few are worth keeping if you take some time to think about who's good for you.
Loneliness sucks but you gotta embrace it, we're adults and its new but it's something that isn't as bad as it seems later on. Trust me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In all honesty you don't have to have anything further to do with your mom. You're an adult now and can decide who you don't and do have relationships with. Tell your mother to go royally fuck herself AND when she has her 80 foot pole thats up her ass removed, she can come talk to you. You have to value your self worth and work on wiping her out of your mind, she's only done bad things to you and from here on out you deserve good things.

<TEXT> Hang out with your mom and a few close friends. And some animals. Lovely cuddly animals. This fall, before I went to college, I was very nervous about going away for my sophomore year because my freshman year, I got my MDD diagnosis and had to take a semester off. About three weeks before I went to school, there were four baby squirrels in my yard that had fallen from their nest. Three survived, one did not, and my boyfriend's family took care of them from that day on. They were the most precious things and it really takes your mind off of things just to have something young to take care of (that's not a child, I suppose). If you're a nurturing type, consider adopting something. I promise that it can help. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you. These people just need to be reconditioned into acceptance. The racist, wild west days are old, and a great majority of America has moved past that phase, but a good amount have not. These are older generations teaching the young, and like you say, they do not supervise like they absolutely should. These things hit home fast, but I'm happy there are people like you around to take a few minutes to acknowledge and react to this.

<TEXT> Why not? It's been like that ever since... forever. Until say around 1988 when the first actions were made to let US women join the armed services. They only this year became allowed to fight in combat, but with these promises come catches; they won't get to actually FIGHT in the combat/infantry devisions, they can do background work like janitor work or nursing work. I wish I was kidding. Otherwise, they can still fly fighter jets and be rescue pilots and things like that, away from direct interference. Women in the US services are just not included, and put off to the side as much as possible. You should watch the Invisible War. </TEXT>

I told my boyfriend of almost a year not to call me and I reject his calls because I feel annoying. His texts have 20 minute intervals, and that alone is enough to make me go back in my shell. 

I have class in less than an hour and I hope I can make it, let alone stop crying. I take medication but it seems that I'm just too emotional today. 

I'm beyond lonely in person, but know I'm not alone in this subreddit.

____________________________________

I left for some Taco Bell and a pick-up at 8:30 tonight, when I left the door to my dorm (which needs one specific key card to get in, mine or the RA's or school) was locked. I know this because when I came back around 9:45, I had to unlock it to get in. 

When I leave, I always leave my grinder and bong on my desk/window seat, in plain sight if you're in the room. You can't see out of my window because the shade is closed and a fan is blowing out, blocking the bottom view. 

My bong and grinder were missing when I came back. I do not misplace things easily. I feel weird knowing someone was possibly in my room. 

-edit- There were no notifications, through email or anything, about room searches. There was no notice left or anything.

TLDR; My bong and grinder are missing from a locked dorm after I left for an hour. What gives? Any suggestions?

Sincerely,
A sad ent </TEXT>

<TEXT> If it makes you feel better, I had the same experience as you growing up, except I didn't start smoking every day until I was 17, and I got diagnosed with severe depression at 18 that I'll probably have to deal with for a long time. Which also stemmed from reasons being untreated personal issues and just being hard on myself academically. 

I am 90% sure that I would have gotten depression anyway, and although my marijuana usage has taken a toll on chemical balances in my brain, I think it was a way for me to deal with it, helping me deal with the present while my mind was thinking about the past and future. I also think dually, it exasperated the depression slightly, so basically it's a win-lose. 

The other 10% knows science hasn't completed its research yet.

<TEXT> OKAY, for starters, I am not advocating that all parents should start smoking weed. They shouldn't.

My boyfriend and I smoke pot with his whole family. The mom, the dad, the little brother, and us. It's a lifestyle I've never really been introduced to before, besides smoking hookah with another buddy's parents. It's only been that way for a few years.

I'm a 19 year old female ENT. Come to think of it right now, I don't think pot smoking with/around your teenagers will really affect their well being. Around kids and infants though, I feel differently.

I feel like more parents should consider it. It's bonding to the extreme.

TLDR; What do you you guys think about family toke sessions? </TEXT>

<TEXT> TLDR; Mets met with American Indian Community House and NativeOne financial of wall street to host a "Native American Day" on June 25. The event was planned for months and was scheduled on the day the Mets played the Braves. Out of nowhere, the Mets decide that it's probably a bad idea to associate the Native American Day with the Braves, and feared it would strike backlash with people with the wrong idea. The Mets had the bright idea of canceling the main events, singing and dancing and a video before the game. HOWEVER, they still offered the charity funds to go through with and to keep the title of the day, but without the celebration, just to keep the deal in place. Therefore, the Native American Community drew back on the plans out of frustration, and the Mets screwed up a good business deal/charity event. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can vouch for this! My current boyfriend was pretty direct with me, and he straight up told me he was attracted to me and that he wanted to get to know me when I came home from school. I was very flattered by this, and his whole brave approach (later on he admitted he was very shy and nervous to at first, thought I was going to reject him) really turned me onto him in the beginning. It shows you want it. Go for it! From the sounds of it, you will have her smiling like a fool at the request. Wishing the best!

<TEXT> At first it didn't do much, which is why the meds take so long to work. After a few weeks of regularity with them, I would generally feel more focused, energized, and motivated. I don't know how to describe it. Over time, I just got... happy. When the meds don't regulate out you're going to be getting headaches and random side effects (it changes from person to person but it's best to push through them.) After the side effects stop is when the meds are working properly. Now, I never get bad headaches if I take mine every day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was that sad roommate last semester, my first semester away at university. I was diagnosed with mdd just like your roommate.
He needs to be in a better environment, asap. It's the only thing that helped me. No matter who is trying to reach out to you, his brain is saying that everyone in that environment is one-sided, can't help, won't understand. Nothing against you, I'll assume. He just doesn't want to open up about what kind of awful things go on in his head. 

Tell him that he needs to give himself a break from school and open up about how he feels and give medication a chance. Tell him things that make him feel better, like a joke or something funny that happened during the day, little talk. It helps suit the mood a bit better, none of that "are you okay? what's wrong?" nonsense. There's no way to put what's going on with him into words, to be honest.

I made it out all right, i hope your friend does too.

<TEXT> Tell her times will change and she won't have to be like that forever. 
Tell her not to be scared to try to fight back, to try to live normally. 
Tell her to get up out of bed everyday and that the sun comes out every day, and that you think of her every day. 
Tell her that life is not out to get her and that she is stronger than her brain is telling her.
Tell her that medication can help as long as she doesn't miss doses.
Tell her not to isolate herself and to TALK to people where she is for support. It's vital for her therapy.
Tell her she's going to be okay.

These are some things I think I would have liked to hear when I was away at college during a bad depressive episode.

-edit- and tell her to exercise. It helps with energy and seratonin levels. It will boost her up a little. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't remember much of elementary school as far as my emotional status. Middle school comes, and by that time there is a lot of fighting going on at home. One temperamental father + one emotionless alcoholic mother + one rebellious older sister = an overwhelmed me. There was a lot of crying, a lot of anger. I didn't know how to handle the anger; not to say I was violent, but I lashed out at people verbally when it wasn't my complete intention. 
Mind you, I'm a shy kid, so showing anything besides my normal self is difficult enough.
High school comes, and then I hit that being bullied part of my life, which now that I look back, triggered a lot of depressive symptoms. Frequent crying, anger, isolation, irritability, dropped grades, no motivation, gained weight. Any symptoms after I did better at a new school after one year of torture stopped for the most part until college, but I still carried around of unresolved bitterness.
College comes, and I'm doing all the right things; making friends, going out, doing my homework. I had a broken hand, so that restricted from me doing anything physical. Then I got mono, which went away about mid october. The lines between where everything went bad are faded between a lot of time being stressed about grades, being away from my home (I live at a best friends house at home currently), and being sick maybe 90% of this semester. 
These are the symptoms I can come up with now, and they're pretty spot on for what I was going through before medication.
Extreme fatigue, feelings of guilt/worthlessness/extreme pessimism, insomnia, waking up from sleep often, sleeping through alarms, irritability, isolation from people, no appetite, no motivation to do school/physical work, physical aches, horrible memory, bad focus, constant state of sadness, suicidal thoughts. I've dropped ten pounds since september. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes. Emotional bullying, it was my freshman year of high school at an all girls school. All the girls spread rumors about me, nobody ever included me, and they were from a rich town while I wasn't. I did no harm to anyone and was just a shy girl when people would actually talk to me. I didn't "cope," I kind of pushed myself through everyday and came home in tears no matter how the day went. I tried to get help from teachers and my parents, telling people how mean the girls would be to me, but nobody did anything, especially my parents who didn't want to jeopardize my place at a very highly regarded school. I did retaliate a few times and confronted a few snobby girls, but they ran off the second I asked if they had anything to say to my face. I'm happy with how I handled it that one time, but it never stopped. After a year of that turmoil (I transferred sophomore year), it left a huge footprint on who I am today. There are a lot of issues with me making friends and trusting people now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So are a lot of other young adults, sadly. I don't know much about those two. I'm on 150mg of Venlafaxine daily, but the dosage is subject to change. I don't have a lot of side effects besides being leveled out emotionally... as long as I take my medication. Otherwise, one missed dose and so begins the anxiety, mood swings, heart racing, bad headaches, isolation, and an overall really bad mindset. I fear not being able to live without it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a young woman in the 21st century with the name Maura, it's not every day I cross paths with someone sharing the same name (Maura's language of origin is Latin. It is predominantly used in German, Irish, Italian, and Spanish, and can be translated to meaning dark, dark-skinned, star of the sea, bitter, and great.) I am already rather confident with the name I was given. However, I don't hear much feedback about it, other than it is rare. What do you guys think of it-strange, ugly, nice etc.?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> UPS Reports Troubling Drop In Residents Answering Doors In Lingerie </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-12-04 02:32:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> "SANDY SPRINGS, GAIn what delivery personnel are calling an alarming nationwide trend, customers who answer the door wearing alluring lingerie and little else now account for less than 24 percent of the shipping business, a six-month investigation by UPS officials confirmed Monday. The latest numbers are, frankly, unacceptable, and a far cry from where the industry stood a decade ago, when the observed rate of middle-aged women receiving packages in titillating undergarments soared as high as 60 percent, UPS spokesperson Mark Dickens told reporters. Perhaps more upsetting is the fact that, of those still wearing carelessly fastened negligees or lace garter belts, a mere 12 percent are remarking on how very, very hot it is outside, inviting the deliverymen in for lemonade, and then conspicuously mentioning that their husbands are away at work and wont be back for a long time. This is a problem that must be rectified immediately. Despite the grim outlook for the home delivery service, a recent employee survey conducted by Time Warner Cable found that its repair technicians continued to report a steady bra-and-panties rate of 92 percent." </TEXT>
