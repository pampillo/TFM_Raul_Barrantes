<TEXT> Yeah I don't understand the whole "only band wagoners would go to the pirates subreddit and downvote them."

I don't really think band wagoners care enough to go and trash talk on a different subreddit. Most of those people in the Pirates subreddit are probably huge Cubs fans who have been watching every game since they were kids.

There is no correlation between "loyal fan" and "being a good sport." </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-02-28 19:08:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I go to a very large state school in the Midwest. I still have no friends whatsoever despite tremendous effort. I was diagnosed with depression and social anxiety about a month ago.
Anyway, having no friends I naturally eat by myself. I was eating in the main dining hall today as I usually do, no person sitting within 20 feet of me. Suddenly, a guy starts walking towards me. I started freaking out in my mind. "Surely he isn't coming up to me, he's probably going to walk past me." But he didn't. He shook my hand and introduced himself. My pessimism still persisted: "he's probably going to try to sell me something or sign some dumb petition." But he didn't do that either. He started asking me about what year I was and what I was studying. I couldn't believe what was happening. He told me he was a grad student and somehow we got talking about sports, which is my favorite thing to talk about. We talked about hockey and basketball, and he seemed so interested in what I had to say. I was actually having a conversation about my interests with someone I actually liked. I hadn't had that in so, so, long. After we talked s but longer he had to go. He said he and his buddies play basketball a lot, and I should play with them sometime. So he gave me his number and bid farewell.
Right after lunch I went to my room. My roommate was there, but the moment he left I broke down in tears. This person made my month (school year, even) just sby simply initiating a conversation with me. I'm trying to keep myself together as I type this. This man gve me an indescribable amount of hope and happiness today. It reminds me that however depressed and even suicidal I am, somewhere out there there ARE people who want to get to know me. If people see someone eating alone, they feel the person maybe really odd or repulsive. But we just want to be talked to. Even if we are very introverted we still want company and friendship.
Thank you, random grad school stranger. Thank you so much.

UPDATE: I just got off the phone with him. I thanked him and We are going to play on Wednesday afternoon.

<TEXT> Very likely. He was just a normal looking guy sitting with a group of guys, so I didn't think he would have had anxiety or depression issues. Then I remembered that I'm a normal person too, so really you can't tell who does or doesn't have emotional issues. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The whole time he was talking to me I kept trying to figure out why he was doing this. I kept thinking he was trying to get me to invest in his business or talk about his role in student government or something. I couldn't be that exciting for him to talk to, why was he doing this? No one just goes up and talks to someone. I finally realized that he was just a nice person. I've been so blinded by depression and anxiety that i didn't think I was interesting enough for anyone to talk to me. </TEXT>

When I hear a car honk, I think they're honking at me, and I get startled and scared. Of course they're just beeping at a car in front of them or whatever, it just sucks. What kind of strangers did you talk to? What did you say? Where were you whe you did this? I'm sorry if I'm asking a lot of questions, I just really want advice. </TEXT>
