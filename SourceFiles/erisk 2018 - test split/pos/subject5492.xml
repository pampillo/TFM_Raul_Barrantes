<TEXT> 21/M/Straight

I just got out of a 8 month relationship and have jumped back in. Downloaded tinder over the weekend and so far have 11 matches, talked to 3, 1 has responded. Haven't gotten any matches in a few days though. Before my relationship I did fairly well with tinder, 60+ matches, good conversations and 3-4(don't remember) dates.

Maybe I'm just uglier now. Do your worst please, I need some good criticism 

Bio:

I definitely watch more Netflix than you so I can show you all the good shows.

Feed me sour candy and tell me I'm pretty

You is 100% of the shots you don't take and that is why my bank account is so low after the weekend

That isn't my dog, but hopefully you don't care

<TEXT> First time commenting here. Used to lurk.

Just got out of an 8 month relationship and downloaded tinder a few days ago. Only 11 matches so far I messaged 2 but no response. This will be harder that I thought. Last time I had tinder I didn't do so bad, 60+ matches, a lot of talking and 3 meets/hookups. Seems the game has changed.

Gonna do a profile review so you can all be brutally honest at how much I suck.

There is one girl that I am head over heels for that matched with me and I'm messaging her later tonight so hopefully it all goes well

Other than that breakups suck, especially at a small school like mine. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Lifting Goals during the summer. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-19 02:06:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Current Big 3 Maxes (1 rep):

Squat: 245lbs

Bench: 195lbs

Deadlift: 335lbs

Working Sets (3x5):

Squat: 215lbs

Bench: 165lbs

Deadlift: 295lbs

My goal by the end of the summer is to hit 225, 315 and 405 on bench, squat and deadlift respectively. I'm currently following the ICF program(3x5 version). My training will begin the 2nd full week of June(going on a 3 week study abroad trip tomorrow) and I hope to hit these numbers by the 2nd or 3rd week of August.

My main goal is to hit these numbers for one rep each, but I would love to be able to hit these numbers for sets. I did some calculations and it seems that it would take me 7-8 weeks to reach my bench and deadlift numbers and 6-7 weeks to reach my squat number. This is without any deloads and almost constant progress. My question is, is it better to work towards the goal of a one rep max for each, or to work towards the goal of preforming sets?

Any comments or suggestions would be appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If we keep advancing I think the defining image will come next series.

Most likely we will face off against the Lightning. I believe after a 1-2 start against them we come back in Game 5 to secure a 3-2 lead where someone scores an OT winner or late 3rd period goal. Or on the other end of the spectrum...Murray shuts the door in a one goal game and as the buzzer sounds the Pens jump on him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand that. I just wanted to talk about a part of all this that it seems people have overlooked. In no way am I condoning what he said or giving him a pass. In what I saw in the orginial thread was that people were mad that he didn't stop and think of what to say during that heated moment. I'm arguing that it isn't that easy to do and people should realize that.

I agree that what Shaw said was completely wrong. I just wanted to point out another view of the situation. People say things in rage and with a clearer mind they regret them for the most part. Unfortunately it was on national television and reflects poorly on all parties. I bet Shaw does regret saying it and it should be handled appropriately. But those that want suspension shouldn't be disappointed when he doesn't get one.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What I would really like to say on the issue would probably just get downvoted to oblivion without a reasonable discussion so I'll say this...

In the heat of the moment people can say anything. Anger takes over and you are just spitting out anything to get your point across. There are those moments were you just can't control yourself. Shaw most likely had one of those moments. Everyone has. I remember a specific time where I had the same moment. I said derogatory things. Do I say those things on a regular basis, in normal conversation? Absolutely not and would never, I know better. But when rage takes over sometimes you lose control of emotions.

Shaw lost control of his emotions and I bet he regrets it, it happens sometimes, especially in a very tense and emotional setting like the NHL Playoffs. Calling for his head is just a way to make y'all feel better about this thing. Chances are he will offer a public apology and recieve a fine for all his actions. And that is what should happen. He shouldn't be suspended for being emotional.

That's just my 2 cents. </TEXT>

1st Date: 12/12/15. The day the Pittsburgh Penguins hired Mike Sullivan and we began an historic turnaround into the playoffs and became one of the most dangerous teams in the league.

2nd Date: 4/13/16. The day the Pittsburgh Penguins began on of the most amazing playoff runs in NHL history. Truly a sight to behold.

And finally...

3rd Date: TBA. The day the Pittsburgh Penguins lifted their 4th Stanley Cup in franchise history, catapulted by a core group of some of the greatest players of this generation.

This is it...This is our destiny. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm still in college so obviously there is an immense drinking culture. Especially at the small private school I go to where the only thing to do on weekends is drink from dusk to dawn.

Unfortunately I can't follow down that path anymore as I've been diagnosed with substance-induced mood disorder, which basically means if I have too much to drink I run the risk of becoming severely depressed or angry. Last time it happened I was forced to go to the hospital after campus police got involved. Really made me look at things in a different light. My buddies and I are all heavy drinkers so putting down 10-12 a night wasn't a big deal. Now though my view has changed to where I must limit my intake or abstain from drinking all together.

At least there are no more raging hangovers and I can make a few bucks off DDing. </TEXT>

The best time is after the workout. Yes, you'll be tired from already lifting but it will be more beneficial. Ladder drills take a lot out of you and it would affect your lifts negatively if you did it before.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Two questions:

1) What exactly do aminos do for your workout? I'm currently taking 2 scoops of PWO but would it be worth it to switch to one scoop of PWO and one scoop of aminos during my workout?

2) How do you count breaded chicken cutlets? MFP lists all these different options with all different macros. I like to get a buffalo chicken cutlet from my local deli about once a week but never know how to track it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wish I had someone to workout with from time to time. I love being at the gym alone don't get me wrong, it's basically my "me" time. Sometimes though it would be nice to have someone there to chat with and motivate each other. It's tough sometimes to mentally hype yourself up without help.

The gym I go to at home is basically full of people 30+ and I'm only 20. Also at school most of my friends play on sport teams so they already go to the gym at different times. </TEXT>

<TEXT> TL;DR: Don't judge a book by it's cover because the book might deadlift more than you.

This isn't my victory but hopefully it counts. Yesterday I was doing deadlifts and my gym doesn't have chalk and mine hasn't come in yet from M S. So I ended up doing 3x5 of 255lbs because that's all my grip could take.

I'm on my 2nd warmup and this kid comes up to me and asks if I'm using the bar that was in front of my in the squat rack. I say no so he takes it and low and behold he sets up for deadlifts. I'm not a judgemental person but wveryone has those moments in the gym. This kid didn't strike me as a big lifter or someone who is pulling weight so I was curious to see how much he does. 135(check), 165(check), 185(check). Pretty impressed at this point and now I'm working on my first working set. He moves up to 225 and gets 5 reps. Then 245lbs. Now I'm looking like a fool cause I doubted this kid and he is lifting almost as much. I finish up my last set and am unloading when he pulls 265 for 5 and finishes up.

He walked past and I told him nice job. He wasn't big or anything and was not expecting what happened. So good on him for making me feel stupid and pulling 265lbs no chalk. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My bench is stalling very badly on 135-140. The mental aspect is just killing me. My chest is always just pretty weak in general. I have two options that I'm considering.

I'm running ICF and know you arent supposed to change anything. I feel as though chest isnt emphasized enough. Could I do one of two things?

1) change bench to a 5x3 format instead of 3x5. Same amount of reps, but easier in the mental aspect.

Or

2) add in DB bench(3x6/moderate weight) for my volume.  </TEXT>

If you have pretty good lift numbers i'd go with PHUL. PHUL got me pretty toned on the 6-weeks I did it and it was always fun. I also enjoyed having 4 days in the gym.

For HIIT look up the bodybuilding.com 8-week program. It is basically just running, so nothing too complicated. I always work up a sweat and feel great after </TEXT>

<TEXT> So this wasn't me, but my friend who texted me this yesterday while on vacation.

He was working out in the hotel gym which only has one bench. The only people there were him and some other kid. He was doing sets of dumbell bench and going good. Then the kid comes over and doesn't ask to work in or ask how many sets he has left, he just says "hey I'm using this now and proceeds to bench as well." My friend is a pretty nice dude and was kind of shocked so he just agreed and didn't cause anything. Although he got really angry when the kid wouldn't gwt off the bench after his sets and he would have to continously ask him to move.

When I saw that I actually got pretty angry as well, goddamn entitled brats. </TEXT>

Where you playing if you don't mind my asking?

As for advice, school comes first. The season will be rough. you'll have a lot of classwork as well as practices that will take up about 3 hours of your day. If you are struggling, talk to your coach, a captain, anyone. Don't hide it like I did. The best thing is to face a problem.

It'll be a great time though. I am still good friends with the entire team and some of them are brothers to me. You'll develop connections and relationships that will last forever. Have fun, play hard, party hard and work hard. Good luck to you man! </TEXT>

Sometimes they don't want me to touch the bar unless they are almost about to die and sometimes they want help at the first sign of failing. Depends on who you help. I would ask them what they want you to do.

If the person has no preference then I'll usually just stand behind them if they are doing good. If they struggle I'll begin to put myself in position to help and when they start to fail I will actually help them finish the lift. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello /r/hockey,

With the offseason about halfway over I thought it would be fun to create a poll where you can submit a player from each position (C, LW, RW, D, G) that you believe is the most underrated, or does not get enough attention for what they do.

Poll: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_YlckgmquaTB4W1aMQQRlLTeAIR333B2ngxW0BTjEZg/viewform?usp=send_form

What I have just posted is a link to the poll. Please fill in one name per position and please only submit the poll once. Only serious answers will be counted.

After about a week I will collect the data and then do a write up of the position and player, in order to give a little background about their accomplishments.

Hopefully this will help us become more aware of these players and watch out for them this upcoming season.

Edit: Please upvote for visibility (self-post=no karma). If there are not enough responses I cannot continue with the write-ups.  </TEXT>

One more question if you don't mind. I know that taking creatine will cause in increase in water retention and cause some water weight gain. Once I get more used to taking it will the retention slowly go down, or will I always be prone to retaining more water as long as I take creatine? </TEXT>

The only thing is, is that everyone says 5g a day, everyday. I am fine with that. But the C4 I use has 1g of creatine nitrate. Will taking 6g a day (1g from C4, 5g from creatine supplement) be okay? Or are the creatine in them different (creatine nitrate and creatine monohydrate)? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The people at my gym I swear. Go to the gym on Sunday, some guy is curling in the squat rack. Luckily he left before I finished stretching so I was able to still use it no problem.

Yesterday, the same goddamn guy is curling in the squat rack again. He is still going by the time I finish warming up so I'm forced to use the shitty other one that barely lets me hit parallel because the saftey bars are too high. Whatever, do my squats its all good. Not as angry.

Couple exercises later I'm still using the rack, other guy comes up to me and asks if I'm done. Tell him I have two more exercises but I can move to the other rack after this one. Finish up, let him take over, chat for a bit and all is good. Start setting up next exercise and then see him proceed to start doing curls....

I had given him access to gains, and he betrayed my trust. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My suggestion would be ICF, the cutting version. It is 3x5 for compound lifts and 2x8 for accessories. You also only progress every other workout. I am currently doing it and love it. Once you get past the compound lifts the accessories are really not that bad. It a high amount of exercise for a beginner but more volume will help you gain muscle and burn the fat off.

Gaining muscle is not a bad thing, yes you will gain some weight from growing muscle but you won't look fatter, you will look fitter. As long as you eat at a caloric deficit you will lose fat. Doing a novice program will help you increase muscle and make you looked more toned out. If you don't do some sort of strength training program you run the risk of becoming skinny-fat. Also due to what you said about your lifting numbers you can gain muscle, it is called noob-gains. It only last 2-6 months, but they are gains nonetheless. Follow ICF guidelines and you'll be getting stronger in no time.

I highly suggest using the search function and reading up on novice programs and learning how to track and count calories. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You said you were looking at PPL, but I'd check out PHUl as well. I was doing it for most of the summer and really enjoyed it. You have the time to do it and even the power days include a bit of hypertrophy. It is also easy to mix and match exercises to fit your likes and needs without straying to far from the original routine. 

Unfortunately had to stop because my lifts, which are already beginner level, were slowly decreasing and I needed to switch to a more strength-based program. </TEXT>

I used to use the ez-curl but for some reason it put a strain on my wrists so I switched to barbell and like it more. I didn't really seem to see a gain or decrease in production though as I switched.

I would say whatever is comfortable. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Ice Cream Fitness(Cutting Version) Lifting #'s to start out. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-08-02 00:06:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Next week I will be starting ICF, the cutting version, once I get back into my gym. I would like some advice on my numbers I have choosen to start out with.

Stats: M/19/5'9/160/~20%BF

My current 5RMs are:

Bench: 145lbs

Squat: 165lbs

Deadlift: 185lbs

Bent-Over Row: 155lbs

OHP: 85lbs

For starting out I have figured to do around 75% of my 5RM as my lifts. My numbers will essentially look like:

Bench: 105lbs

Squat: 125lbs

Deadlift: 135lbs

Bent-Over Row: 115lbs

OHP: 65lbs

I will be adding 5lbs every workout to squats, 5lbs every other workout for bench, row and OHP and 10lbs every workout for deadlifts.

As for accessory work, I am deloading about 10% to start out and adding either 5lbs or 10lbs every other workout depending on the exercise.

Is this a good starting point for me or should I consider going lower?

Unfortunately I am getting my wisdom teeth out today, and also small plate removed from my jaw when I broke it about 4 years ago.

<TEXT> So after 8 weeks of PHUL on a cut, it is getting to a point where I have begun to stall on all my lifts.

My numbers are pretty beginner (All 5 rep maxes):

BP: 155lbs

OP: 80lbs

Squat: 175lbs

Deadlift: 185lbs

Bent-Over Row: 145lbs

But I wouldn't consider myself a brand-new lifter/beginner. I guess I would classify in somewhere inbetween beginner and intermediate. I played lacrosse my first 2 years of college and thus have knowledge of lifting and working out from team lifts and trainers. The problem I encountered was that my lifts were even worse when first played, so I was always embarrassed to lift in front of teammates and thus never gained strength.

My question is, should I do a beginner program (looking at SL5x5) because of my numbers, or should I try some sort of intermediate program.

I am still looking to be on a cut for the time-being if that helps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The question that haunts all us males...how do I talk to my girlfriend about fitness?

She is trying to get fit but is lacking a lot of knowledge that could help. She doesn't know about calorie deficit, her diet is not the best (healthy, but with many treats intertwined) and she doesn't quite understand you can't target specific fat. 

Her diet is basically low-carb, she barely eats them. But she'll have ice cream with her friends a few times a week and eat a lot of fatty foods like red meat and cheese. I don't know how to convey that if she changes her diet it will work much better.

I have given her some of the things I've learned here but it isn't much. Don't get me wrong she has made progress but as much as she could. I believe explaining a lot of the things I've learned here will help her tremendously. Of course weight loss is a touchy subject and I don't want to hurt her by saying the wrong thing or getting into a fight. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First off we have around the same TDEE. I personally am at 1700cal instead of 1900 but thats just me. Work with your diet and meals. You can always change your calorie intake and you should once you start losing weight. If you feel like you are eating too much or cant hit your macros go down a little.

As far as running I am not sure. You could google "how many calories you burn in a mile at x pace" or just run to your hearts content. Personally I would give serious thought into a lifting program as well. You're BF% isn't high at all (which is what you should take note of instead of BMI) and the more muscle you have, the harder your body works to preserve it which means more calories burned. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Losing weight means eating at a calorie deficit (calories in  amp;lt; calories out). To find that you need to find your TDEE then minus about 500-700. A quick google search should bring you to plenty of TDEE calculators you can use. Remember, diet+exercise  diet  exercise. Diet is the most important part of losing weight.

If you are new to the gym and lifting you will see muscle gain (noob gains). Even on a diet it is possible to build muscle, you won't build a lot but it will be there. The wiki has a ton of great starter programs you can use. For cardio there are a ton of options out there. Find one or a few you like and stick to it. Doing something you don't enjoy won't help your goals

It isn't possible to target fat though. Fat loss is fat loss is fat loss. Some places are harder than others to lose fat. Unfortunately the stomach seems to be one of them. Don't be discouraged. What I do is weigh myself once a week and take progress pics. If I am feeling down I just look back at all that I've done and it motivates me more. It'll take time and hard work but if you really want to get fit, you won't give up. Hope this all helps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I started at 178lbs. Currently 166lbs.

The problem was the first 3 weeks I was doing a bodybuilding.com workout that was a complete waste of time. I actually started decreasing in my lifts so I had to switch. I lost a lot of fat and water weight at that time though because it had me running 4 times a week. I switched to a PHUL routine in week 4 and have experienced many gains. I've definitely built muscle which is why I am currently plateauing at around 166 </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah im currently 7 weeks in but held a ton of water weight and excess fat and I also had stopped lifting for about 2 months so any progress I made was gone. I'm just now starting to see gains and definition. Mostly noob gains that are already slowing so this is the real push I need to make.

Long term I'm looking to shed as much BF and have a lot of lean muscle then hopefully in a year start a monster bulk. But for the near future its all about getting lean </TEXT>

<TEXT> What's up everyone? I first started my cut in May and so far have lost around 12lbs. After switching workouts about 4 weeks ago and this already being mid-July it is time to step it up. I'm looking for someone to help me get the motivation I need to stay one track and also not take that dreaded trip to Five Guys haha.

Same goals would be preferable as I am competitive by nature and would love to try and race someone to get fit first.

Here is some more info I posted on /r/fitness about my cut: https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3d0wvr/routine_critique_diet_4day_split_for_cutting_male/

<TITLE> [Routine Critique + Diet] 4-day split for cutting: Male, 19 years old </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-12 18:25:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So after a few weeks of tweaking my workouts/diet I think I have found a good balance for my goals. I was hoping /r/fitness could take a look and give some criticism on what could be done, if anything.

Stats: Male, 19, ~166lbs, ~20% bodyfat (not sure how accurate)

Goals: Lose body fat while maintain or even increasing strength. Also set building blocks for healthy lifestyle

Background: So I started doing getting serious about weight loss and fitness in June and found a program on bodybuilding.com to use. I didn't like it as it focused completely on hypertrophy, but also I felt like I was just wasting time at the gym instead of making progress. I consider myself to be somewhere between beginner and intermediate (played lacrosse and had organized lifts for a couple years) so was looking for something more than a 3-day split. I found PHUL after a few days of researching routines and I really like it. I have changed some of the workouts to more strength based than hypertrophy because I am relatively weak and am happy with the size I am at currently. Below is my 4-day routine plus have added in my diet to make sure I am cutting correctly.

**Routine**

For reference here are my 5 main lift 3x5 maxes:

Bench: 145lbs

Squat: 175lbs

Deadlift: 165lbs

Bent-Over Row: 155lbs

Overhead Press: 85lbs


Day 1-Upper Power | Day 2-Lower Power | Day 3-Upper Hypertrophy | Day 4-Lower Hypertrophy
-----------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------
Barbell BP: 3x5 | Back Squat: 3x5 | Barbell BP: 3x5 | Back Squat: 3x5
Incline BP: 3x6 | Deadlift: 3x5 | DB Flye: 3x10 | Barebell Lunge: 3x10
Bent-Over Row: 3x5 | Leg Press: 3x6 | DB Shoulder Press: 3x8 | Leg Extension: 3x10
Lat Pulldown: 4x8 | Leg Curl: 3x8 | DB Lat Raise: 3x10 | Leg Curl: 3x10
Overhead Press: 3x5 | Standing Calf Raise: 3x10 | DB One-Arm Row: 3x10 | Leg Press: 3x10
DB Shrugs: 3x10 | Cable Side Bend: 3x12 | Seated Cable Row: 4x8 | Calf Press: 4x10
Barbell Curl: 3x10 | Russian Twist: 3x30 | Preacher Curl: 3x10 | Cable Crunches: 3x10
Skullcrushers: 3x8 | Side Plank: 3x30secs | Tricep Pushdown: 3x10 | Plank: 3x1min
 |  |  | Toe Touches: 3x20


I have 3 rest days (one between day 2 and 3 and two after day 4). I use 2 of them to do cardio and on those days I run about 2 miles. So far I have seen good progress on all of my lifts except for bench press (more mental than physical).


**Diet**

At this point I would love to have criticism on my routine but if you feel like taking a look at my diet that would be very helpful as well. My TDEE is estimated at between 2400-2600 calories. I am currently eating around 1400-1600 calories a day. I am only counting macros and my grams per day are: Protein (170g), Carbs(160-180g), Fat(20-30g). I do good at hitting them all, except carbs I am sometimes low. Below is my diet which is usually pretty consistent throughout the week.

*Breakfast:* 4 eggs (3 egg whites, one whole); One slice of whole grain bread and one tbsp of peanut butter (on lifting days) or one packet of instant oatmeal (on off days); 6 ounces of unsweetened coffee with 2 ounces of 1% milk.

*Lunch:* 4 ounces of baked chicken or one packet of starkist tuna salad; 1 ounce of black beans or one whole wheat tortilla or 2 slices of whole grain bread; 2 ounces of spinach or 4 ounces of mixed vegetables (carrots, green beans, peas, corn); One apple or two baby clementines

*Dinner:* 6 ounces of baked chicken; 1 cup of instant brown rice or one medium sweet potato or 2-3 ounces of whole grain pasta (with 2 ounces of tomato sauce); 4 ounces of broccoli or 4 ounces of mixed vegetables

*Snacks:* One banana (before workout); 2 scoops of ON gold standard protein powder (in8 ounces of water); one scoop of C4 blue razz pre-workout; one small handful of cashews (on rest days)

You basically have my entire routine and diet here, please feel free to critique and offer any advice as needed. Thank you! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I saw this music video on reddit I believe a month or two ago. I remember a lot of it, except of course the band name and song name.

Sort of an indie style song, upbeat tempo. Starts off with a kid in a car with an attractive woman. Then it shows different lives, each with something taboo occuring throughout the video. One is a guy beating up his neighbor, another is a guy having sexual relations with a neighbor's daughter, one is a wife cooking her fat husband and the last is a girl hoping someone shoots her religious dad.  At the end the kid in the car gets in an accident and it shows that from each perspective of the lives it was something the characters wished would happen, but actually didn't.

Hope this helps. I would really like to know the song. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's the beauty of the what if...but I do think Toews is more talented than Staal and even if he isn't who he is now he wouls still develop into a top-tier player.

But you could also argue that with the talent, you have Crosby as 1C, Toews as 2C and move Malkin to the wing.

<TEXT> Don Sweeney is the new GM of the Boston Bruins. Aside from him making Claude Julien wait while he decided his future he has made quite a bit of bone-headed moves in the last 48 hours.

First off he traded Dougie Hamilton (considered the future of the Bruins defense and one of the best young d-men in the league) to Calgary their 1st rd and two 2nd rd picks of this year. Why? Dougie wanted too much money.

Next he resigned Andy McQuaid to an extension with an AAV I believe of around $2.5mil.

Then he traded Milan Lucic to LA for Martin Jones, a prospect d-man and this years 1st rd pick. Noteworthy to add the Bruins retained salary on Lucic. 

Adding this together makes it questionable why the Bruins would trade Dougie and then re-sign a different defenseman and retain salary on Lucic. There was also a rumor floating around that Dougie only wanted $5.5mil per year, but not sure how reliable that is.

Onto the draft. With Boston having 3 consecutive first rd picks (13, 14, 15) there was speculation that they would use those in a trade with Arizona to move to 3rd and grab Noah Hanifin. That did not happen, and there was another rumor that the package Sweeney was offering Arizona had none of those picks in it, again not sure how reliable. With the three picks, Boston choose to keep all three and proceed to draft 3 players that were not even Top 20 in rankings, and I believe one was ranked low as 40th. These choices of course angered fans everywhere and turned the Bruins into the butt of the joke. Also something about a goalie in the 3rd round they could of easily gotten in the 6th or something.

That is basically it. I think. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd put Jarry over Murray. Jarry was talked about as a future NHL starter, while Murray was rarely noticed until he blew up this year. Murray had an incredible and historic run, but that was also behind arguably the best defense in the AHL.

I think they will both become great goalies but I'd still over Jarry over Murray, at least for right now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So there was this kid that used to come to the gym about a year or two ago. I never saw him since then but he just returned yesterday. The thing is this kid has a fake leg right below the knee. 

Now when he used to come he only really did upper body, and maybe some single-leg calf raises. So I'm sitting on the bench and he comes in and walks straight over to the squat rack, does some warm-ups, then puts on 185lbs and fucking bangs them out. Few more sets, finishes up and just walks away like it was another day at the office. You could even see is friend try and talk him into using light weight. I was in awe and just watched these magical gains unfold.

I've been feeling shitty lately about my progress cause I've been stalling but fuck that, if this kid can do that with one leg, then I can get my ass out of bed and go to the gym as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I'm currently on week 5 of a cut. I've been still trying to figure out my diet and decide to try a IIFYM calculator to help me. It helped in terms of how many calories I need to consume (~2460 maintence and ~1900 for a cut) but in terms of nutrient it said to consume 240g of carbs, 150g of protein and 45g of fat. I understand the protein and fat, but the carbs amount just seems very high. Yesterday was my first day trying it, and even with eating complex carbs with every meal, I was only at 210g with about 200 calories left.

Should I decrease my carb intake and up my protein intake to help balance the diet more, or leave it at that?

I'm new to all of this so any help would be great! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Video: https://youtu.be/tldPKY0Ys8I

Each of these exercises I completed for 3 sets of 5 reps. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

**Squat:**

Questions: 

* It looks as though I hit parallel everytime, but should I be going lower if I can?
* My elbows are jutting out, obviously and is that a bad thing? I did my last two sets with my elbows tucked in, but it felt uncomfortable and put a strain on my shoulders.

**Deadlift:**

To me it looks like my overall form was shit. I never was properly taught how to deadlift so have been watching youtube videos to learn. The one that really helped me was Alan Thrall's video, which is what I used as a basis. It looks as though I'm using my back too much and not enough of my legs. Also I kept rocking back when I got all the way up, how can I stop that? The weight was relatively easy, but should I use a lighter weight just until I can get proper form? </TEXT>

If you like ICF then do ICF. You are obviously still hurting so it is good to be doing a workout you enjoy so it makes the gym as fun as possible!

As far as nutrition I would look at the wiki and search bar as they can both answer questions you may have. Also look up youtube videos to help with tips and proper form on exercises.

Make sure to set your goals and stick by them. You got this dude! </TEXT>

Someone was curling in the squat rack! Can finally cross that off on the gym bucket list.

But real story time, so does anyone feel like they are that unliked or outcast regular? I've been going to my gym for about 2 years now and know pretty much the regulars. The thing is is that they all talk and interact with each other, except for me. Plus someone them give me dirty looks, especially this one trainer who just stares at me while I do my workout. I mean maybe it's just me, but I feel like I'm disconnected from the others cause I'm one of the only young people who use my gym. I don't mind it to much though cause I pretty much keep to myself but just something I thought I'd share. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I'm currently running a 1200-1500 calorie diet (19 Male on a cut). It's been about 4 weeks and I've already lost 10lbs (178-168). Is this too much? I presume most of it is water weight. I'm just wondering if I'm also losing muscle mass as well cause of all the weight loss, but my lifts have been about the same though and I'm hitting my daily protein goal as well according to MFP.

Also, where is the best place to by a small food scale? I'm guessing any grocery store?

Edit: My diet basically consists of chicken, eggs, whole grain rice/bread and fruits/veggies. Pretty basic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is it bad to change to a new program if you haven't finished the old one. I'm currently doing a bodybuilding.com workout plan, but I don't enjoy it much. The workouts aren't that great and it seems to have a heavier focus on cardio than lifting. I was thinking of switching to a p/p/l split with cardio in between but not sure if I should finish my current program first. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am going to go ahead and be the one with the unpopular opinion and take the downvotes.

Honestly in my eyes he only got fired cause he was the women's coach. If he was the men's coach he would still be there and nothing would of happened.

 In one instance, according to the report, a player asked Handrahan to stop yelling at her during a meeting and the coach responded by saying, I havent yelled. Do you want me to show you what yelling is?

If that really is one of the reasons why he ~~got fired~~ then that's kind of bullshit. Coaches aren't there to be your best friend. They are there to get the best out of you and if that means hurting your feelings then so be it. My old lacrosse coach said things 100x worse to us then "get horny for the puck." We just sucked it up and moved on. He wasn't our friend, he was our coach. If he needed to be tough, he got tough. </TEXT>

<TITLE> A Look Back At The Arizona Coyotes Last 10 First-Round Draft Picks </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-06 00:20:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So a user on /r/nfl is doing something like this right now where they take a look at the past 10 draft picks of each team. I thought this was a cool idea and wanted to try it myself. If it gets good feedback and y'all like it then I'll keep going. Enjoy!

Team Subreddit: /r/Coyotes 

**Overview**


Forwards | Defensemen | Goalies
--------|----------|-------
7 | 3 | 0

* *Players Still With Organization:* 7
 
* *Non First-Round Picks Whove Had Success:* Keith Yandle, Daniel Winnik, Kevin Porter
 
* *Biggest Hit:* Oliver Ekman-Larsson
 
* *Biggest Bust:* Peter Mueller
 
* *Best Chance At Success:* Max Domi

**Picks**

*All information for players taken from either HockeyDB, HockeysFuture, TheHockeyNews or Wikipedia(no shame)*

*NHL Stats current as of 3/3/15*

**2014: Brendan Perlini-LW (12th) NHL Stats: None**

Analysis: The Yotes newest draft choice, this young boy from England is a pretty big one at 62, 212lbs. A solid draft year saw Perlini score 71 points in 51 games. Known for his hands and puck skills, Perlini adds a nice scoring touch to the offensive game, as shown by 42 goals in 3 seasons of OHL play. Mix size and skill together and you have yourself a nice net-front presence for the future.

**2013: Max Domi-C (12th) NHL Stats: None**

Analysis: Son of Tie Domi, this kid most likely wont be known for dropping the gloves at any time. With slick mitts and a great shot, Domi is an offensive threat anytime he steps onto the ice. Whether it be passing or shooting, look for him to be in the action. His maturity and decision-making has been questioned, but once he hits the show and receives some veteran help, look for that to fade away.

**2012: Henrik Samuelsson-C (27th) NHL Stats: 2 GP, 0G, 0A, 0P**

Analysis: Another son of a former NHLer, Henrik is the son of two-time Cup winner Ulf Samuelsson. With only 2 NHL games under his belt, Samuelsson is still developing and hopes to make the big jump soon. Playing for Swedens MODO as a teen, he made the jump to the OHL in his draft year, putting up a respectable 23 points in 26 games. Currently with 25 points in 51 games for the Portland Pirates, Samuelsson is a big body, power forward with a nice set of hands.

**2011: Connor Murphy-D (20th) NHL Stats: 86 GP, 4G, 10A, 14P**

Analysis: Seriously? Another son of a former NHLer, Murphy is the son of Gord Murphy. A product of the U.S. national development team, Murphy ended up backing out of his commitment to play at the University of Miami and signed with the Sarnia Sting. I say it was a good move as he became one of their top defensemen in his two seasons there. Only spending half a year in the AHL, Murphy made the big jump for the end of the 13-14 season putting up 8 points in 30 games. This season he currently has 6 points in 50 games but hopes to remain a fixture on the Yotes defense for years to come.

**2010: Brandon Gormley-D (13th) NHL Stats: 26 GP, 2G, 1A, 3P**

Analysis: Son of a formerjust kidding. A highly touted prospect in the 2010 draft (6th higher N.A. prospect) Gormley is blessed with a wicked shot and is known for his power-play abilities. Dont knock his defense though as he can shut you down there as well. 4 years in the QMJHL and 3 in the AHL has given this kid all the time in the world to develop and he has excelled at both levels. His current situation has him on the Coyotes roster with 3 points in 21 games.

**2009: Oliver Ekman-Larsson-D (6th) NHL Stats: 321 GP, 49G, 93A, 142P**

Analysis: One of the most dynamic defensemen in the NHL right now, Ekman-Larsson has been a contributor ever since being drafted by the Coyotes. His first full NHL season was in 2011-12 and he put up 32 points in 82 games. A very mobile puck-mover, Ekman-Larsson knows how to find spots and create opportunities. Finishing 7th in Norris voting in 2014, the sky is the limit for this young stud. 

**2008: Mikkel Boedker-LW (8th) NHL Stats: 383 GP, 67G, 107A, 174P**

Analysis: Speed, speed, speed is Boedkers primary asset. A very fast winger with a nice set of hands, look for him to dish the puck around on the offensive side. Going back and forth between the AHL and NHL since being drafted, Boedker got his first full season in 2011-12, putting up 24 points in 82 games. A regular fixture in international play for Denmark, look for him to be a solid 2nd-liner for years to come.

**2007: Kyle Turris-C (3rd) NHL Stats: 376 GP, 84G, 121A, 205P**

Analysis: The Man, The Myth, The Legend. THE Kyle Turris. A great offensive center with a nice shot, Turris was the Coyotes highest draft pick the past 10 years. Coming from the U of Wisconsin in 08, Turris played a solid two seasons with the team before being traded to the Ottawa Senators in 2011.

**2006: Peter Mueller-C (8th) NHL Stats: 297 GP, 63G, 97A, 160P**

Analysis: Ew. That pretty much sums it up. All signs lead to this guy being a great NHLer and having a pretty good career. 2 seasons in the WHL saw him put up 136 points in 103 games. The transition though never happened. After an awesome rookie season, Mueller could never replicate the production and it just kept sinking and sinking. Finally, traded in 2010 Mueller now is out of the NHL and playing in the Swiss League.

**2005: Martin Hanzal-C (17th) NHL Stats: 493 GP, 88G, 158A, 246P**

Analysis: A gritty center, with a solid two-way game, Hanzal has been a consistent 30-point player in each of his 8 years with the organization. Getting the A in 2011, Hanzal has now provided a nice veteran presence that will be good to have in years to come. A respectable 24 points in 37 games had come to an end this season when he suffered a back injury that looks to have him sidelined till the end.

**2004: Blake Wheeler-RW (5th) NHL Stats: 516 GP, 138G, 209A, 347P**

Analysis: A big, burly winger at 65, Wheeler is a very gifted player who can get into the dirty areas. Coming out of the U of Minnesota as one of their top players, Wheeler never played a game for the Coyotes as he was traded to the Bruins in 2011.

 **Final Thoughts:** 

The Coyotes have drafted some solid pieces in these 10 years. With a focus on offense, even with defensemen, the Yotes have been doing well at keeping their picks in the system and helping them grow. Now with their focus on a rebuild, look for them to continue their successful drafting.

Ehh. A bit high, but really this was our only option. No real #1 goalie on the market this year, I don't see Griess being able to handle a #1 role and Jarry is still a few years away.

I do like it though. Flower will do his best to earn that money and with a new system in place things could start going his way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Redshirting means that you sit out a year of playing. But it does not take off a year of eligibility.

You can still fully practice but cannot play in games. If you truly believe that you won't get much PT talk to your coach.

Just cause you redshirt doesn't mean you can skip practice. Tell your coach about school and everything and he may let you skip a day of practice here and there to help with your schoolwork </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is data comparing two teams. There isn't even a league average in there. So I don't think it's fair to assume that.

Also when looking at the graph, the two biggest drops were when the team was one of the worst in the league and on the verge of being sold. Now yes it spikes up once Mario and Sid are drafted, respectively. But still is pretty stable other than that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So i currently have an internship at a pretty big company. I have silver tie clip that I like a lot and wear it with my outfits. Although, I seem to be the only one wearing one, from what I can tell. Our dress code is shirt, tie, slacks and dress shoes so to me adding a tie clip doesn't seem too out of place. But I do feel that it might be a bit tacky/show-offy.

What do you guys think? Or do you have any opinions on them? </TEXT>

<TITLE> My high school bully is now coming to my college. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-31 02:44:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This really put a damper on things.

So I was browsing around my school's sports website (I'm on the lacrosse team, so I was wondering if any news about us was up). There was a post about the incoming recruits for the football team and I decided to give it a look. Scrolling down the list mindlessly, one name caught my eye and as soon as I saw it my heart dropped. It was the douchebag that bullied me all throughout high school.

This guy abused me mentally and physically. I was originally cut from the JV team in HS and he made fun of me for it everyday, he also called me names relentlessly. I was also a total loser so it was pretty easy for him to pick on me. He is around 6'3 250lbs and I'm only 5'9 175, so easily he shoved me around, hit me and knew that there was nothing I would do.

I hate his fucking guts, he made me miserable. Ever since college, I have never been happier, I have tons of friends and being on the lacrosse team is a dream for me, and something I strived for. I am a completely different person than in high school. But now he is going to be here, and it is quite a small school and I will easily see him at times. I know some of you might say that he is may of matured or whatnot, but trust me, if he gets that chance he will just bully me again. He is crazy, and I'm pretty sure not all there in the head. At times he would act like my best friend, then all of the sudden snap. He would relentlessly bully me, follow me around, shove me if he saw me, the works.

I am honestly scared to see him at school. I don't know what will happen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know what it is. I don't want to die but I think it's that if I do, then I know people will care about me. A lot of my childhood and teenage years I was bullied and didn't have a lot of friends, this turned me cold and emotionless. Now that I'm in college and nothing from my past is with me, I have a lot of people who care for me but I still can't comprehend it. I don't think I'm suicidal but I think I'm insane.

Each time I've had people talk me out of it and make sure that I knew that I was special. It's helped but there is still just something there. Something that makes me want to get behind the wheel and risk it all.

I've also been getting more fucked up at parties, last Saturday I snorted vodka to feel a rush. I've been getting trashed and that has just worsened my intentions. Right now I am a mess. I've considered talking to a therapist. </TEXT>

**Mini-Biography:**

Mario Lemieux was born on October 5th 1965 in Montreal to Pierrette and Jean-Guy. Lemieux started practicing hockey at the age of three in his basement and eventually his father built a rink in their front yard so he and his brothers could play.

At the age of 15, Lemieux was drafted by the Laval Voisins of the QMJHL (Quebec Major Junior Hockey League). He had declared he would break records, and that is exactly what he did. During the 1983-84 season, Lemieux broke the season record for points with 282 (133 goals and 149 assists). In his last game of the season Mario needed 3 goals to tie Guy Lafleurs goal record. He ended up scoring 6 goals and adding 6 assists in a 16-4 victory.

The Penguins selected Lemieux with the 1st overall pick in the 1984 NHL Entry Draft. Lemieux had said that he would play for any team that picked him, but because the Penguins and Marios agent had not agreed on terms for a contract, when his name was called Mario refused to shake hands with management and also did not put on a Penguins jersey. Despite the conflict a contract would be agreed upon and Lemieux started the season as a Penguin. He made his first appearance on October 11th, 1984 against the Boston Bruins. On his first shift, Lemieux would steal the puck from future Hall of Famer Ray Bourque and score on his first shot. During this season Lemieux would be named to the NHL All-Star Game and go on to be the first rookie to win MVP honors. Lemieuxs rookie campaign was tremendous; as he had posted 100 points and went on to win the Calder Trophy as the NHLs top rookie.

The next few seasons Lemieux kept up with his crazy point production and in 1988 won his first Art Ross Trophy (top point producer) with 168 points. During this year he would also collect the Hart Memorial Trophy as league MVP. In the 198889 season, Lemieux led the league with 114 assists and 85 goals for 199 points. Lemieux finished the season a close second to Wayne Gretzky in voting for the Hart Trophy, and set several milestones and records in the process, becoming the second player to score 70+ goals in two seasons, the fourth player to score 50 goals in 50 games, and the only player to score 13 shorthanded goals in one season.

During the 1992-93 season, Lemieux scored a goal in his first 12 games and was on pace to possibly surpasses Gretzkys single season goal and points records. This was until he made an announcement that shocked the hockey world. On January 12th, 1993 Mario Lemieux told everyone he was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma. Lemieux underwent aggressive radiation treatment and missed two months of the season. On the day of his last radiation treatment, Lemieux flew to Philadelphia to play against the Flyers, where he scored a goal and an assist in a 5-4 loss. Before the game Lemieux earned a standing ovation from Philadelphia fans, which just goes to show how much he meant to the game. Even with missing two months Lemieux would score 160 points and beat out Pat LaFontaine for the scoring title. He also went on to earn the Bill Masterson Trophy and Pearson Trophy.

During the 1993 season, Lemieux experienced many back problems and underwent back surgery for a 2nd time. After the season Lemieux would take a leave of absence to recover from his treatment. He would return for the 1995-96 season. During that season he again led the league in scoring with 69 goals and 92 assists, and became the 7th player to win 3 Hart Trophies and the 4th player to win 5 Art Ross Trophies. The next season Lemieux again led the league in scoring with 122 points, and also announced this would be his last season. When he retired Mario Lemieux was the only player to average more than 2 points per game. On November 17, 1997, Lemieux was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame and also becoming the ninth player in history to have the mandatory three year waiting period waived.

In 1998, the Penguins were in trouble financially and the threat of moving or folding the team was very real. At this point, Lemieux offered to buy the team. Years of deferred salaries, adding up to $32.5 million, had made him the Penguins' largest creditor. He proposed to convert $20 million of his deferred salary into equity, enough to give him controlling interest. He also promised to keep the team in Pittsburgh. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court gave preliminary approval to Lemieux' bid on June 24. Lemieux later said that he would have put in a bid even if he had not been owed the deferred salary. The NHL's Board of Governors approved his application for ownership on September 1, 1999. Two days later, the court gave final approval to Lemieux's reorganization plan, allowing him to formally assume control. This made the then-retired star the first former NHL player to become majority owner of his former team. Lemieux assumed the posts of president, chairman and CEO of the Penguins.

In 2000, Lemieux decided to make a comeback into the NHL and on December 27th played against the Toronto Maple Leafs, where he would score a goal and add 3 assists. Despite playing in only 43 games Lemieux scored 76 points to finish 26th in scoring and finish the season with the highest points-per-game average. On December 23, 2002, during his afternoon radio show in Pittsburgh, host Mark Madden said he would donate $6,600 to the Mario Lemieux Foundation if the hockey great ever scored off a faceoff. That very night, the Penguins played the Buffalo Sabres in Pittsburgh and Lemieux, who was aware of the challenge, made good on it when he scored the game-winning goal right off a faceoff during the third period. On January 24, 2006, Lemieux announced his second and permanent retirement from professional hockey at the age of 40. This followed a half-season in which he struggled not only with the increased speed of the "new NHL" but also with atrial fibrillation, which caused him to experience irregular heartbeats. Also, Lemieux remarked that" I can no longer play at a level I was accustomed to in the past, possibly another reason for his leave.

Nowadays, Mario Lemieux is still owner of the Penguins Organization and has brought them back to the top of the league. He also founded the Mario Lemieux Foundation to fund medical research projects. He and his wife, Natalie, along with their 4 children; Lauren, Austin, Stephanie, and Alexa reside in Sewickley, Pennsylvania.

P.S. We have the same first name...tehe.

<TEXT> **DAY 16: BROOKS ORPIK #44
PLAYER SUMMARY**


Born September 18th 1980 in San Francisco, CA, Brooks Orpik (Brooksy) currently plays defense for the Penguins. Orpik started off his hockey career by playing for the Nichols School in Buffalo, NY then heading over to Massachusetts to play at Thayer Academy. Although never playing in the CHL Orpik went on to play for Boston College for 3 years winning the Hockey East Championship twice(1999 and 2001) and the NCAA Mens Ice Hockey Championship in 2001.

Drafted 18th overall by the Penguins in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft, Orpik spent a year with the Baby Pens before in the 2002-2003 season was called up and has been with the Penguins ever since. In his first full season Orpik played in 79 games, registering 1 goal, 9 assists and 127 penalty minutes. In 2008 he signed a 6-year deal worth $22.5 million that will expire at the end of this upcoming season. Along with Evgeni Malkin, Orpik wears an A on his sweater to represent alternate captain.

**BENEFIT TO THE TEAM**

Not only is Orpik a hard-hitting gritty defenseman, he is also a leader in the locker room. His play on the is always physical and he tires opponents down with his checking. He doesnt back down and do whatever he can. Although in recent years he has lost some of his touch he is still a valuable player on and off the ice. He is a leader in the locker room and a force on the ice.

**HIGHLIGHTS**

* ["The Shift"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpBXdefDulU)
* [Huge hit on Daniel Paille](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwdHmuiJZyw)
* [OT winner against Islanders](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-x91Snvs6I)

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

Brooks Orpik has played for the Penguins all his life and myself, like many of us hopes to see him retire that way. There has been speculation of moving him in order to make the cap. Although we do not know what will happen we know what Brooksy provides. Most likely playing on the 2nd and 3rd pairings and PK, Orpik will still be a tough defenseman to play against and along with Scuderi will be the veteran leadership the defense needs.

P.S. Sorry about the weird formatting.

<TEXT> It is a temporary crown on an implant. Not a temporary implant. Sorry.


So I have a question about my temporary crown on my implant. I got it today and it will be on for 2 weeks until my permanent one is ready. So on Saturday me and some buddies are going camping. This will include kayaking, rope swinging into a lake and cliff jumping. I was just wondering, would by implant pop out from any of this. Like when hitting the water would the pressure and subsequent biting down make the crow loose?  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I have volunteered to do the /r/hockey 30 Greats in 30 Days thread for the Pens. Lemieux is our great. Now I could do this myself and put all of my opinions in it but I wanted everyone to be included. So you guys are going to help me, I want this to be the best post of them all and I can't do that without all of you. I want everyone's opinion on this, not just mine.

So the categories that I want you guys to help me with are:

Rivals: This can be a team or player, we can have as many as we want.

Career Achievements: Obviously a lot of will go on here, many of them without discussion, but if you feel like there should be something listed here that is significant let me know.

Highlight reel: I want to see all of Lemiuex's greatest moments in this thread. We can have as many as we want so go crazy.

Extra Information: Anything else you feel is significant.

Like I said, I could do this all by myself and only put in my 2 cents but I wanted to get everyone involved so this can be the best 30 Greats in 30 Days post of them all.

<TEXT> That was a great thing Young did after he stepped on Hudson's ankle. I have never seen a player run up and help a player he injured. Young seemed generally concerned for Tim. Even when he was being carted off, Young was over there talking and making sure everything was good. I have never seen a player do that. Now I haven't been able to watch a lot of Mets, since Dish Network hates them, and ESPN just pisses me off but that was the first time I have seen that.

Stay classy, Eric Young. </TEXT>
