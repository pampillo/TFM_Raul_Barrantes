<TITLE> I am a 23 year old solo traveler from Alaska going to Portland for 2 and a half days in the beginning of June. Any recommendations of things to do within that short window frame? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I love peaceful sightings like gardens and public parks, I am willing to spend but the less is better! I also love hipster shops and coffee shops, but don't know any specific ones. I just plan to roam around most of the time. I can uber, walk, and take the cabs, but do you guys think that if I rent a bike, I can reach most of the great spots in Portland?

Thank you! I appreciate the help. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I need travel help: PORTLAND to FLORENCE (Heceta Lighthouse) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-17 20:22:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello, I am traveling to Oregon by myself this June 3rd - June 7th by plane from Alaska. For the first two nights, I am going to stay at a AIRBNB and probably be leaving on the 5th (Monday) to try to explore the coast. I don't want to rent a car, I want a different type of transport. I prefer buses. I was wondering if Greyhound + Taxi is reliable to get to the Heceta lighthouse? What is the timeframe you recommend? I don't need things to do at the lighthouse, I simply want to go there for my photography.

Any advice on how to get back to Portland as well?

Thank you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I totally agree. I've always seen **Spanish Sahara** as this soft yet hardcore lullaby that represent unsaid words Chloe that didn't get to tell Max up at the lighthouse after the ultimatum.

When I listen to Spanish Sahara, I imagine Chloe's ghost hugging Max when she has difficulties falling asleep at night due to thinking back at the horror that she has went through in the course of that week and saving The Bay. Chloe being there, constantly in the back of her head, existing only as a memory that existed only to Max. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am diagnosed with Major Chronic Depression, and I fell back into another phase where I constantly think about death and wanting to die. I've been plotting my death for a few days ago and this brings me comfort. 

I even had a major mental breakdown at work where all my co-workers saw me cry and I was sent home, because I was plotting ways to ask for paper clips to cut myself without anyone knowing. I told my boss about this.

I bring myself to therapy because my parents ignore my depression. They never say anything when I try to talk about it, they turn their nose at me. Then they only say things like, "are we getting charged for those 'therapies you go to?' That seems to be their only concern.

One time my dad even told me, "You don't even have a reason to be depressed."

Few weeks ago I told my mom that I've been cutting my wrist for awhile. She just guilt tripped me and said that I make her feel ill.

Since I work with her, she knew about my breakdown a few days ago. This morning I was telling her that I was feeling low, I've been trying to let her know. She told me to just snap out of it, because it's embarrassing that everyone is talking about us at work now.

I almost broke down and I'm just trying to push through. This job makes me miserable, but I'm trying so hard in life. But it piles up so much and I am so overwhelmed and feel like I am drowning constantly, depression makes me feel like I am suffering. I want to die so much. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess it was more of a turning point and motivator for me :) I am clinically diagnosed with Major Chronic Depression with suicidal tendencies, and instead of actually hurting myself, I decided to put myself through a change to better myself emotionally and physically. 

I didn't lose weight to get back at him, but instead more like revenge because I was with someone who constantly talked down at me and made me feel worse about myself. I wanted revenge to feel better, but in the end I ended up benefiting more than I could ever imagine; health, physique, mindset, etc. 

It all fell into place and for myself only.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> THANK you :) I basically started doing mostly cardio in the start, and reducing my calories but by bit, then whenever I hit a plateau, I always sped up my metabolism by having random cheat days or changing up my workout routine (and eventually incorporating weight training)

The whole process took around 4-6 months. It left a lot of loose skin in the belly, but worth it :) I am still working on it! I have 20 more pounds to go :D </TEXT>

I could see them not selling the soundtrack due to licensing, but they could totally sell the Necklace and the Hotdawg mug... I have no clue why they won't do so. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They look like someone literally just made a necklace XD They do feel like real bullets though :) Made of brass, I believe.

I tried to make my own before after buying a fanmade one, I used real bullets and this was the result:

<TEXT> Yeah! I actually bought one from him before and it's great :) The official one is great for collecting... but as for wearing? Well, let's just say you have to be careful, it does get unscrewed very easily and I can imagine the tops getting lost easily. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's great! However one thing that I prefer with the fanmade ones over this is that the fanmade necklaces seem to be more sturdy? The bullet tips on this official necklace are all unscrewable and removeable for whatever reasons. It looks exactly like the game and it has a good weight to it. </TEXT>

I only added the quote so far around my ankle, but I'll see if I'll add the butterfly in the beginning of the quote like how it is placed in the "This action will have consequences" text ingame :)

Thank you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes! It's interesting how people interpret it differently though... I guess the Sacrifice Chloe ending kind of made people associate it with sadness, but to me it's more about moving on and not letting the suffering get to you, because it's only going to be here for a limited time :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would never sell it... it really is priceless D: I don't know why anyone would, but perhaps financial reasons... It think that person is really lucky as well well...

True though, I feel like they really wanted to release it as a merchandise, but I heard it had something to do with the copyrights in music? It's unfortunate though, I think it would've helped the company greatly, since music is one of the selling points to the game ^__^ </TEXT>

<TEXT> The CD version of the soundtrack is included in the limited edition release of the game if you wanna get one :) The vinyl itself was released to DONTNOD members, and very limited of 5 copies were given out during a sweepstakes during the live streams and during the pre-orders of the limited edition. I believe that you can also get it from the REWARDS from Square Enix site, it takes 600 points to get it, I think $89 worth of items is 60 points though... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would love to see them one day! I live in Alaska, So perhaps I'll travel just to see them one day. I've actually been checking out their other albums too, recently Antidotes was on replay on my playlist :) They are amazing! I actually got the tattoo of "It's future rust and it's future dust" around my ankle, that's how much of an impact this game, this song, and this band had one me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Why Spanish Sahara?**
This song means the world to me, it empowers me. I am so grateful for this game for introducing me to few of the best songs I've ever came across. One being especially this song. It captured me from the start. The cinematography is perfect with it (the memories erasing, Chloe's funeral, and the butterfly.) I will never forget the memories it has given me.

**Why pick *"It's future rust and it's future dust"? * **
Because it means that pain and suffering will eventually fade as rust and dust would. I've had so much suffering in my life, whether it'd be emotional or physical, and I am diagnosed with Major Chronic Depression as a base of it all... and in the end, I have to remind myself that only the good memories matter. Pain doesn't last forever, I need to leave the horror here :) This quote keeps me moving forward when I'm feeling lowest.

<TEXT> *Life Is Strange* is a choice and consequence-based  video game that is very dear and precious to my heart. It helped me through my suicidal phase last year, because I related to the characters so much and the story really did distract me from all the horrors in my life, at least for awhile. The soundtrack in the game definitely a gem and one of the most beautiful collection of music I've come across, and no words can describe how every single piece makes me feel.

Recently, I went through a loss, and It was a very low point in my life to which I was also self harming but going through therapy all at once. At the right timing on the right day, I received an unexpected package from Square Enix. I was not expecting to ever win this or anything, consider how limited in quantity was produced for promotional purpose only... and it was signed by the voice actors! I was glowing for days and it still definitely lightens my mood looking at it, and I still can't believe that luck can somehow turn around. 

It also gave me the kickstart to collecting vinyl! I only have 8 so far, but I hope to grow it :) I collect mostly of the indie folk/rock genre. If you guys have any good artist suggestions, I would love to check them out!


**Edit:**
The song I love the most in it is **SPANISH SAHARA** by FOALS. It's my biggest coping tool, the lyrics are beautiful and haunting.

*Forget the horror here*
*Leave It all down here*
*It's future rust and it's future dust*

*I'm the fury in your head*
*I'm the fury in your bed*
*I'm the ghost in the back of your head*
*'Cause I am* </TEXT>

<TEXT> I won this from the Sweepstakes ^^' Hence why it's signed by the voice actors... I heard that it's very hard to get it as a SE reward, I think $1,400 needs to be spent in merchandise to obtain it with points, unfortunately :/
But sometimes I think they randomly have contest and Sweepstakes for Europe too! Don't lose hope :D </TEXT>
