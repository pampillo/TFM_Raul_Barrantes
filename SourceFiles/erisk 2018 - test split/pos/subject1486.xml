<TEXT> I'd go into a strip club. I'm a 21 year old in a smallish town and I just want to know what it's like! I'd go all around the place, into the back rooms of shops, I'd freely stare at whoever I wanted to. Maybe I'd just follow someone around or explore places like people's houses, the boys' toilets, all of those sorts of places. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a law in Australia, too. It's the biggest load of shit, you can't even defend your home or your family from a burglar without the risk of being sued, or having charges against you as well.
It happened to one of my friends' family, who own a swimming pool and hire it out to people. A woman broke in, trespassed on the property, "tried to find the light switch" and slipped on a step, breaking her arm. The family got sued, the woman got off. Apparently the judge's reasoning was "There was not enough safety reflective tape on the step to prevent accidents".
Edit: She broke in in the middle of the night, when it was completely dark. Hence the light switch. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm Australian and I've had "snags on the barbie," "cold ones" (beer), I've called people "mate", backed slowly away from a mad kangaroo, fed an emu (wildlife park obviously) and been scared shitless by a Tasmanian Devil in the bush whilst camping near the beach (I live in Tasmania [No this is not Africa])...
I've waited in line at a footy game (Aussie rules) for far too long for an overpriced meat pie to eat with sauce.
I've been asked to repeat things for Americans, you either can't understand me properly or just like my accent, who knows!
I've also been to the beach on Christmas day and seen Santa in board shorts!

Edit: I also call "candy" or "sweets" lollies.
HOW COULD I FORGET VEGEMITE ON TOAST? I grew up on that stuff!

<TEXT> Sounds like a game we played called Murder in the Dark. Basically you get a bunch of people in one room and draw out of a hat whether you're a citizen, the murderer or the detective. You turn out all of the lights and everyone hides, and the murderer has to find and "kill" the citizens before the detective figures out who he/she is. In a pitch black room with furniture, it's pretty dangerous but still fun. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I personally have no idea why people have this fear of "sounding homosexual"... Having to add a disclaimer so people know you don't sway that way is just adding to the crazy misconception that any gay man, upon thinking another man is gay, is immediately going to want to crack on to them.
It's like, I'm a straight woman (most of the time), and yeah there are attractive men around, but having the same sexual orientation as a potential mate isn't enough of a reason for me to pursue or sleep with them. .
Gay people have standards just like everyone else :/

P.S. Not trying to be all personal I'm just venting what I think :/ </TEXT>

Not all women are man-haters, not all men are mysogynists. It's people like you who are the reason there's still sexism around the place (both ways, not just towards ladies) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have NEVER heard of someone doing that. The last guy I dated still has my Nintendo DS though, and a Game of Thrones inspired cookbook that he hasn't returned after about 3 months. Maybe that's his doucheface "fee" of our 3-week-long aborted fetus of a relationship. Apparently saying my ass was fat, whilst feeding me pasta and as much grease as you can imagine (I am 55kg, and pretty insecure about my body, and usually eat quite healthily), and telling me all of my opinions were wrong and that I was crazy (despite having a college education, while he had dropped out of senior year high school). He also hijacked all of my cooking. I LOVE cooking, especially breakfast. He fucked with my french toast and it was awful. He mixes the egg and milk together on a PLATE. a PLATE!!! It practically went all over the bench! It doesn't even mix properly! So we had to have a breakfast-off, until he finally admitted my cooking was better. 

He borrowed my pokemon games too. He's NO GOOD at sex or pokemon, and it was just as painful to endure either. :/ 

Whoops. That was a wall of text if ever I saw one .

TL;DR: Asshole took my DS and can't cook. Also, never tell a chick her ass is fat if you want to keep her around/are not a complete turd. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I totally agree. Relying on someone else for your happiness only sets you up for disappointment/heartache cause ultimately all anyone cares about is themselves. A few months back my long term boyfriend broke up with me and I thought the world was ending, I was depressed and abusing whatever substance I felt like... Until I woke up and realised that no-one is worth being miserable and wasting your life over, and decided to take control and move the fuck on (currently still single but happier than I have been in a long time).
It's an overused saying but, "Every 60 seconds you spend being sad is a minute of happiness you'll never get back". Life's too short to let people who aren't worth it bring you down :)
