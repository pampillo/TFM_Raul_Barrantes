<TEXT> That's not true you can be forcibly hospitalized for Suicide attempts and even saying to your friends, listen I'm going to kill myself and I wanted you to know because I care about you and don't want you to be shocked. 

That friend can then call paramedics to  your house and those paramedics will take you to the hospital where they will likely make you stay until you are no longer a threat to yourself in their opinion.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The freedom of speech is a right, as is owning a gun, and publishing articles, and not incriminating oneself in trial. 

Not a single one of those rights require the government to do anything for you. 

The traditional definition of a right is that one is free from government intervention barring them from exercising that right, as opposed to the government having to assist them in carrying out that right. 

The government doesn't have to buy you a gun, or fund your paper, or force people to listen to you. They just can't stop you.  </TEXT>

I will say you've somewhat changed my view on minor physician interference but not so much governmental interference. In that the doctor should at least get them to wait and be sure they've not changed their mind after a week or two.

It felt like the dude I knew was dying and even to this day we aren't great friends anymore. Mostly because I don't get on well with girls.

<TEXT> Good point in favor of my view. 

If parents can not vaccinate putting all manner of vulnerable populations at risk for death, or attempt to pray the epilepsy or diabetes away for their child based on a very wrong interpretation of scripture. Why can't then a adult be allowed to do what they want also. 

I'd say not getting your child medical care based on generally accepted false religious beliefs and an adult with depression committing suicide are pretty much on the same level. </TEXT>

Like a person with Stage 1 cancer, who for whatever reason decides to either rely on prayer or homeopathic nonsense instead of proven medical care. Or decides fuck this, I'm just going to let myself die. Now does a doctor get to stop that adult from not getting care?

<TEXT> Personality disorders often include suicidal ideation as a part of it. 

They're not exactly, not thinking clearly or rationally. And personality disorders tend to not have medications that help with that and are entirely dependent upon things like DBT and learning behaviors. 

And worst of all there are quite a few Psychiatrists and therapists that won't work with people with personality disorders because of their tendency to manipulate situations.  </TEXT>

To be fair, their life could just get infinitely worse the longer it goes on. Just as easily as it could get infinitely better. 

In my own specific life I'd say me 10 years ago was at a much better position in life than me now. And I can definitely see it getting worse as time goes on. I'm sure there's a good chance it won't. But things tend to go wrong just as easily as they tend to go right.

<TEXT> Okay you have a point, but then does that mean that someone else gets to decide at what point a person has had enough of trying to deal with the illness or that the individual can decide when they've tried enough treatment. 

If one consider it as the same as cancer, can doctors force an adult with treatable breast cancer to seek treatment rather than allow them to choose to let the disease run its course? Or furthermore, when a person has stage 3 cancer, can the doctor force them to continue to seek treatment under the hopes that it just might work, even if they would rather not? 

If the answers to those questions are no, then shouldn't the suicidal person then be allowed to choose to check out when they want?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> CMV:Suicide is an acceptable right of any adult even if they aren't physically in pain or dying. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-01 16:47:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Not including people with deathly illnesses or with dibilitating and painful health issues.

I believe that people in emotional and psychological pain be allowed to commit suicide and that actions to stop them via the government and health officials is wrong. Additionally, I believe that intervention  by friends and family to seek help because of the family's own emotional reasons (ex: they will miss the suicidal person and be affected by such a situation) is wrong and should not be thrust upon the person as reasons to avoid what they believe is the solution to their problems. 

Here are some quotes from great thinkers on the subject:


 They tell us that Suicide is the greatest piece of Cowardice... That Suicide is wrong; when it is quite obvious that there is nothing in this world to which every man has a more unassailable title than to his own life and person.
 - Arthur Schopenhauer

Whereas, I reject such philosophical arguments like this: 

 He who contemplates suicide should ask himself whether his action can be consistent with the idea of humanity as an end in itself.
 - Kant

Change My View.

I've been molested, physically abused, and treated like shit. All before I was 10. 

I've been raped, and then they told everyone I was begging for the dick so no one believed me. 

I was plied with tons of liquor at a party and left by myself with a bunch of dudes only to come to later while I was getting done by 3 of them. And I'm pretty certain I didn't consent to that. 

I've a kid with autism, whom I will have to take care of for the rest of my life. 

I used to work at Google and now I'm stuck at home attending to my kid and sweeping floors when I could be doing much much more with my life. 

And I've only one friend now. And he doesn't need me. He's getting married.and I'm sure hanging with some chick that's not his wife will eventually become not a good thing. And he'll slowly fade away.

Also I learned that I have like a psychological disorder not an actual sociopath because I feel remorse and care for some people. But that I don't really care about anyone because of it. 

Like basically, no one matters to me but me. But they said with some effort I might be able to learn to care about people that don't directly benefit me in a way. 

Like he said that basically, I care about my family (husband and kid) because they provide something for me. I care about friends because they serve me for entertainment and social reasons. But basically once they stop being beneficial to me they cease to matter.


They made some suggestions for my aftercare. Which I'm considering taking because my friends were pretty insistent in me going. And I might attempt to give it a shot instead of just going thru the motions. 

They suggested that I try a 2-3 week intensive DBT therapy program that manages and adjusts your medication and will address my multiple issues. 

I think I might give it a shot. I was honestly planning on stopping everything including the psychiatrist and all therapy together because it lead me to the stupid hospital.  But at the behest of my friends who are all very disappointed with me for not taking the opportunity seriously, I am going to really try to benefit from the intensive outpatient program. 


Any advice or opinions are welcome. </TEXT>

He says I should go to the hospital before I do something I regret. But I don't want to go because I fear I'll be stuck in there for weeks.

I said all my goodbyes and one of my friends kinda realized what was going on. And seemed very concerned. So it made it harder. 

All my other options were insufficient. And I tried slitting my wrists but it's exceedingly painful and it's difficult to get the correct angle. 



So I took a sleeping pill and went to sleep. 

I'm still not sure if I want to live. But I'm going to mull it over a bit more. And I'll talk to my pastor about it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah,

Idk like it says that low blood pressure can be problematic with the prophynol 

And I'm using the hydroxyzine but I literally will fall asleep and be dead to the world. 

If for some reason I have a panic attack at 1pm and my son gets home at 2pm. I'd have to live with the panic attack til he got home and then basically while he was home. And that's on a half of a 25mg hydroxyzine tablet.

I'll cut if I can't do anything about the panic attack. Because that's the only fool proof remedy I have without Xanax or Valium. 

Valium and Xanax doesn't even get me high. I've taken double doses and nothing. Plus I pretty much calm my shit once I've gotten a way to deal with the panic attacks.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Currently my psychiatrist has me on hydroxyzine for my occasional anxiety attacks. 

One of the psychiatrists that I'm interviewing or whatever for a replacement for my current Psychiatrist (he's moving to a new area after June) has suggested Propranolol as a option because the hydroxyzine makes me sleepy and I have things to do. 

However, I don't like the idea of the propranolol because of the effects it has on high blood pressure. I have severe anemia and often get light headed. 

I suggested that I'd prefer to go back into the Xanax that my former psychiatrist had written for me when I lived in NYC. However, he's gungho on this damn propranolol. 

I'd just rather use the medication that worked for me in the past. 

I was stable and everything was working well for me. I was working consistently as a freelance writer and was productive as a stay at home mom. 

Now I'm just doing a bunch of nothing because I'm not very able to do things because my moods are all over the place. 

He said he's worried about possible addiction but honestly it's a bunch of bullshit. I have panic attacks once my medication is stable about 2 times a month. 

A single 30ct script lasted me an entire year. 

I just think I should know what works for me better than someone who sees me once a week. </TEXT>

That morning buy some miracle, we had a fully decorated tree a train going in front of the tree, a fully stocked kitchen and presents.

Idk what my mom did for that. Pawn, hooking, begging for money, and I don't care.

That was the last Christmas we had together because she died the next summer and it was magical.

<TEXT> You shouldn't be taking communion if this is what you are thinking about. 

Also it's the true body and blood of Christ given for you for the forgiveness of sins. Keto or any other diet should not be in your mind when it comes to communion. 

I'm literally an alcoholic. And I have no problem with taking communion that starts out as wine. You know why because it's Christ's true body and blood over the bread and wine. And I'd rather be out of ketosis and out of sobriety than give up the body and blood of my lord Jesus Christ who gave himself up for me that I might be saved. 

So I really hope that this post is just a joke that you really didn't think about beforehand.  </TEXT>

I didn't realize there were all those other options.

<TEXT> I'd basically do that thing parents do. You know when you have two kids and they keep fighting over a video game.

I'd be like, if either of you start a scene, or anything else, no more anything. And I wouldn't care who started it.

No Christmas, Easter, birthdays, graduations, and more until you complete family counseling.

And if it happens again, after that no more forever.

When I was a kid that worked.

You basically realized that you'd fuck yourself over and try to be sensitive to the other so they wouldn't fuck you over. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My son (9) has been wetting the bed again. 


Other than an occasional accident. He's hasn't wet the bed consistently in years. 

Even at about 5 he pretty much stopped having accidents. 

From what I know sudden new bed wetting is the result of some kind of trauma. 

In fortunately my son is non verbal autistic and can't tell me what's going on. 

Do you think I should contact someone to see if they can check his bladder or if he's been abused in some way? 

The only adults that have access to him other than my husband and myself are the bus aides and the teachers at school. I

It's possible he's been getting bullied on the bus but I figured the bus driver would tell me. 


Any advice is welcome. </TEXT>

I guess the developmentally disabled who can't read the Bible are just lost. And those who can't understand the Bible are a bunch of sinners. 

And summarizing the entire faith into a few lines is stupid. 


All those church fathers were so wrong. Stupid council of nicaea and their studied Christian theology. 

How dare they take the time to make the summary of the faith easily accessible to the masses who didn't have entire Bible's at the time.  </TEXT>

You don't need them. But you need to believe the things they profess or else you aren't a Christian. 

They are summaries of multiple Bible verses that speak to the nature of God and the whole gospel. 

Since it takes many people years to read the entire Bible.  </TEXT>

* In one god. And that that God made heaven and Earth. 
* In one lord Jesus Christ
* That Jesus is the only begotten son of God. 
* That Christ was born of the Virgin Mary
* That he suffered and was crucified
* That he died and was burried. 
* That he descended into hell
* That he rose again on the 3rd day
* That he ascended into heaven to sit at God's right hand. 
* That there is a holy Spirit. And that he is God 
* That the Christian Church that professes such things is your church.
* That their is only one true, holy, Church that professes the whole unadulterated faith. 
* That baptism saves you. (1 Peter 3:21)
* That all Christians should commune (this is my body, this is my blood) or Lord's supper. 
* That God forgives our sins.
* That we will eventually be resurrected in body and soul. 
* And that we will live forever in heaven. 

If you don't believe those things. I'm sorry, you aren't a real Christian and are wasting your time. 


And I don't mean reciting it. I mean that you would suffer death and all things rather than turn away from these teachings.

<TEXT> Marriage. 

It's probably why people get divorced. 

People think marriage is all love and sex and happy times. 


Marriage is that, but a lot of time it's watching your wife get her stomach cut open to birth your son. Cleaning up your husband's vomit when he gets sick and doesn't make it to the toilet. 

A lot of fighting about money. 

Buying toilet paper. Arguing about dumb shit like who left the milk out and hoe you don't want to waste 3$ on milk because someone didn't put it away. 

People think it's happily ever after. 

But it's basically two friends who live in the same house. And friends have fights and get annoyed with each other.

As for the psychiatrist, it's going to happen regardless. I tend to become interested in dudes with doctorates.

I have to get along with the person.

I didn't get along with the first therapist because he believed the truth was relative whereas I do not. And she just didn't want to allow me to believe in objective truth.

Which meant I couldn't continue.

This guy we have a bit in common but I am not sure if I can deal with being berated.

<TEXT> I was fainting and passing out for about a few months and refused to see a doctor. Is get short of breath just cooking dinner. Like basically I was super ill. 

So one day in out with my family when suddenly I begin to pass out in the street. Some stranger called the ambulance and we go to the hospital. 

Turns out I was severely anemic. I ended up getting 2 pints of blood to get me to 7 when I was at a 5 or 6 prior. I think normally I was supposed to be at 12-13. 

The doctor said based on the examination if I'd have went any longer I'd have died.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Once in highschool, me and some friends decided to have a little party. We brought weed, and tons of drinks. So about 2 hours in all the girls left to supposedly go to the store and it was just me and 5 dudes. I probably should have left with the girls but I was determined to get fucked up beyond all recognition. I think I probably wanted to drink myself to death. 


So it's 15 year old me and 5 dudes ages 18 -24. We're all friends and hang at gatherings occasionally. 

So first were just chilling listening to music and doing shots. 

Then about an hour after the chicks had left and it was obvious they weren't coming back, the guys were like let's play poker. Halfway through that turns into strip poker. Well that doesn't turn out well for me.

Well a while later, im suddenly getting done by one of them, I don't really know how that even happened, I guess I blacked out. 

At that point I put on my jacket, my pants and my shoes. And the next day I wake up in bed not knowing how I got home. 

I figured I just ran the 2 miles back to my house. 

The next time I went to school there were all these rumors about what a slutty bitch I was and stuff. 

I couldn't really tell if it was true or not because, I didn't really remember shit after we started playing strip poker.

And I had decided to stay. 

But I really should have just left before things got weird. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I found a DBT therapist, I really only did it because I was feeling exceptionally good and decided I wanted to please my psychiatrist. I think I may have gotten a bit of a crush on him. I'd literally do anything for him. 

So the DBT therapist is a little abrasive. He's kinda a dick. But I kinda like him, but I worry we'll butt heads at some point. 

I can't tell if he were berating me for being a jerk to the other therapist or if he was just being honest. He kept telling me about how rude I was to the other and how I wasn't going to actually do the work and he didn't want to waste time. And that i could just lie to my psychiatrist and say we didn't mesh. 

But idk. 

It's like WTF. 


Was he being a jerk. 

On the other hand. He loves the things I love. He had those saint candles with Einstein and Sagan on them. He loves Scotland and he loves hitchhikrrs guide to the Galaxy. 

What do you think? 

Is he a jerk or am I being overly sensitive? </TEXT>

I think one is pill minder

Otherwise, I'd say, eat even a slim Jim or a glass of milk I. The morning with the pills. A glass of milk has protein, fat, and carbs. That's a pretty decent "meal" 

And if you add in a Carnation instant breakfast. It works out well.  </TEXT>

Tuesday, I felt super happy about setting a date for my suicide.
By Tuesday night, I said fuck it I'm just going to kill myself now. However, my pastor happened to call so I felt all cared about so I said never mind for now. 
By Wednesday morning, I was boned up to do a massive amount of cleaning. I made omelettes. I cleaned the car, I organized magazines, I got shit done. 
Wednesday night, I went to church. Everything was okay. 
By 2am this morning I woke up a little scared and upset about some choices I made. And wanted to cut but I decided to do something else because I made a promise. 
I took a nap and now I'm like cleaning, doing needlepoint, watching documentaries, I called like 20 different therapists to set up a DBT therapy program. I'm getting shit done. 

Then I for some reason became bored as shit or something and thought, this would be an excellent time to just cut myself. 
And then I called my psych. Because I'm thinking I'm going insane. 

This is not normal. 

I'm like all over the place. 

Anyone ever have issues like this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Keto has been working for me. I already had had a hard time losing weight due to pcos. However, when I started meds for depression when I was only considered depressed. I rapidly gained like 30lbs despite following a diet with my nutrionist. 


I've been seeing a new weight loss specialist. He put me on a low carb high fat diet or keto type diet. And I've lost like 14lbs in the last month. 

Which is amazing. Because before I'd lose like half a pound every 2 weeks despite working out 3-4 days a week for an hour each day. And also following a strict diet with 1500kcal. 

So this is pretty sweet. 

That might help. Don't let the weight gain / swing get you down tho. 

Eventually everything will work out. As long as you take care of you.  </TEXT>

I'm lutheran and we aren't necessarily too fond of being considered Protestant. Because Protestants tend to reject the real presence and things of that nature. And the liturgy. And the church calendar. 

But I get the frustration. But honestly I just don't want to be associated with baptocostals. So I introduce myself as a member of the holy apostolic catholic lutheran church.  </TEXT>

My grandfather died a bit ago and I was told I wasn't allowed to come to the funeral. No one would tell me where he was having the funeral. And this guy raised me. He was my defacto father. He's the one that taught me how to ride a bike, and questioned my first date. 

I didn't drink then. It wouldn't have changed my family from assholes to saints. It wouldn't have fixed the issues of what happened that made me and my other family members have a rift, and it wouldn't have brought him back. 

I made a meeting and told my new dad figures how I felt. And their advice and concern for me helped me get thru it. 

I promise you if my wack ass could get thru that you can get thru this. 

I'll be here for you. But most importantly try and make a meeting or meet up with a sober friend.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dr said he was worried about me and strongly stressed it wasn't because it's his job.

I mean I have a plan, I need a new method tho I think the other one is way too Painful and drawn out.

It was that way because I figured I could finagle my way around the commandment that says thou shalt not kill. But I've learned it doesn't work that way.

I chose a date. I wrote the note and everything.

I also kinda told everyone but I put in in super happy terms about taking control of my unhappiness and doing something about it.

So we discussed inpatient as an option. I said it was ok. That I wouldn't do anything until I wrote out a pros and cons list and called him about it. 

So we're working on that.

He said it's good that I keep my promises. Despite unrelenting urges to cut I made a promise not to so I've been keeping that. So he trusts I won't til then.

However we think I need to work on redefining what makes me happy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I'm depressed I don't spend money and everything is okay, but I spend all day not doing anything and wanting to die. 

When I'm in my hypomanic mode I clean, I cook more intricate foods, I do stuff and also I spend tons of money that I definitely don't have. 

Like for example, for some insane reason I decided about 2 months ago, which was when I was finally diagnosed as bipolar 2, to just buy whatever I wanted and overdraft my bank account by nearly a thousand dollars.  

So then I was stable and had a good plan to fix it. And if I'd have followed it I'd be fine right now.

But then I got depressed and didn't care 

And I think I've been manicy lately because I ordered a bunch of books and food and brought clothes and randomness and while I should have only been 200$ in the hole especially since my husband had worked some overtime it might have been less than that. 

But now I'm back there. I'm a grand in the hole. And rents due on Tuesday. 

Idk what I'm going to do. 

I mean I'll be back in the black but have like very little money to spend. Not enough for rent and the car payment that's due. And to have enough money for food and essentials til next paycheck. 

Idk what to do.  


I really fucked up. 

I think I need to go away or something. 
Idk. 

I'm just lost.

Even Paul said, "For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing." Romans 7:19 esv

Whatever that sin that he kept doing was. It didn't make him any less Christian. He was still very much a member of the body of Christ. 

Can any sin separate us from the Lord? No. That assumes that you are capable of undoing Christ's sacrifice. I know I'm not that powerful, and I doubt you are as well. 


Additionally, it sounds like you are depressed. Please go speak with a therapist or psychiatrist to assess your situation. Remember Christ created intelligence to help us. doctors (even psychiatrists) are there to help us get better and live a life that God wants us to have. 

It may not always be a happy life, but making sure that you're okay is important.

When we ate carbs, my family of 3 went thru about 1 bag every 2 months or so. 

And frozen veggies are good. 

A big 5 or 10lb bag of flour
Some baking soda
Some baking powder
A 5lb bag of sugar
Some butter, or margarine that's good enough for baking and cooking. 

You can make your own cookies, cakes, and breads.

And now i cant get any work. Meanwhile I'm on some income based repayment plan for my student loans and as long as I stay a stay at home mom I pay like 5$ a month or something like that.

<TEXT> If it's to make money, you're gonna need lube. 

People don't really need lube for vaginal sex unless you're gonna have a ton of it or I suppose have gone thru menopause. 

If you wanna make more than a fiver a day, I think lube would really really help with such money making endeavors.

<TITLE> Finding Meaning or Purpose (warning suicide thoughts) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-22 02:50:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been increasingly more suicidal lately. 

I always think of suicide. That's like baseline for me. I can go to Disney world and be having a great time and still think, this would be a good time to kill myself because I'll go out on a high note. 

Basically, it's rare that I'm not thinking about it. 

However, lately I'm moving forward in my thoughts. 

Where once it was just the idea. It's now moved to me having the idea, and knowing the method, and having the method handy. And like a true writer and planner researching ideas for what to say in the note. But no date yet.

I've told all this to my psychiatrist and he is not yet worried for me in that he hasn't suggested that I make my way to the emergency room. 


However, he did suggest that I try to find a way to stop feeling trapped by the obligations and commitments in my life. 

For example, I've a kid and a husband and while I'd love to travel the world and join a research group in Antarctica over the winter. I can't do that because of them. 

So I feel trapped by my life. And to me it seems the only way out is death. Currently I just pray for it. Hoping that I'll go to a doctor and they'll say "you have terminal cancer or something" but alas no. 

But I don't know how to not feel trapped. 

I made commitments I can't just cut out on them. And abandon them. 

So I'm stuck and miserable. 

For you who have found meaning and purpose in the midst of horrible circumstances, how did you do it. 

Any tips?

Thanks in advance </TEXT>

I thought it would be rigid and like going to school or something and you gotta do this and that and no room for making me comfortable with the thing.

<TEXT> I know how you feel. I'm here for you.

Like I literally have had people say that I hate my son because I wish he didn't have autism or complain about the utter difficulty that our lives (mine, my husband, and my son) now entail.

It sounds like autism. It wasn't until later that my son got better with other kids. But he does love playing with adults. 

He's nonverbal so it could be communication issues that make it hard for him to play with other children. Just like your son has hearing loss and that might make it hard for him to play with other children. 

Try talking with early intervention. And I hear that some people like and find enjoyment in support groups for parents if children with special needs. 
I have only gone to one or two. I didn't like it. 


I hope everything works out. 

If you wanna bother me. I'm available. 

Much love to you. You're doing some hard work. Also fuck anyone who makes you feel bad. They don't know what it's like.  </TEXT>

Mine did a few like Prozac and some other common ones. 

They cost me about 3$ per 30 days.

I'm not sure what your financial situation is so I can't say. Also try and see if you qualify for Medicaid. I believe there may also be a buy in program but I'm not sure because I only know of one from NYC which is much different than other places.

Anyway. Good luck </TEXT>

I'm only moderately close with my brother. I'm completely cut off from the rest of my family. I guess maybe because they're all narcissistic jerks. But it's possible my then undiagnosed bipolar disorder had a play in the rift.

But it's like telling me, you need to go swimming and I'm telling you I'm afraid of water. Well forcing me to go when I don't want to go isn't going to make me  enthusiastic about going. In fact forcing me when I'm not read is a sure fire way to making sure I'll have a terrible time and hate water even more than I did in the first place. 

All I want is the ability and leeway to go when I want to go. Shoot, all the force towards it makes me want to go less than originally. 

If he had said, "look into this thing and we'll keep doing therapy" 

I'd have looked into it and probably come back the next week like okay here's my questions. But instead he's like you're gonna go because I'm going to stop doing anything but forcing this upon you.  </TEXT>

I'll do it for 3 weeks to make everyone happy and then I'll quit because I don't like it and don't want to do it. And because I'll now harbor resentment to my psychiatrist for making me go I won't return to see him either. 

And eventually I will descend into me sleeping all day and showering when I absolutely must. (1x a week). 

I don't want to do that. I just want to grow into doing the thing I don't want to do. 

It's like when I had a drinking problem. Everyone told me go to AA. But I didn't want to. Well I went. It was a disaster. And then I refused to get any help whatsoever because I harbored resentment for the program because of people forced me to do something that I didn't want to do when I wasn't ready. 

If that's what he wants. Cool beans. But ultimately it's my money. I should get the service I want.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I sent this letter to my psychiatrist because I don't want to do DBT. His response was basically, I'm not going to force you, but I'm not going to do anything but force DBT on you til you do.

Idk what to do.

The letter I sent is below. 



I know you're busy and have a life and things to do.

But I'm just feeling very depressed and sad and lonely and isolated.

I get that you're concerned for my well being and think DBT is the best thing for me.

But I don't want to do it. And because I don't want to do it and you seem hell bent on me doing it. Its like I feel pushed. And when I feel pushed it makes me feel boxed in and choiceless.

And I get that maybe it's the best thing for me. (And sorry for the message, I'm much better in writing than in conversation). Maybe it's the greatest thing that I'll ever experience, but I just don't know if right now is that time.

I wasn't even going to do talk therapy in the first place. But I figured that it would be a good place for me to discuss and possibly learn how to deal with the crippling disappointment that I feel in my daily life.

But it's like we can't talk about it. We can't discuss it. Because you don't want to do anything but this silly DBT thing. And I venture that no matter how great it is, it probably doesn't have a 100% success rate.

Why can't we just operate under the assumption that it doesn't work for me. At least until idk I'm willing to do group therapy, or interested in DBT. Or not so much of an anti newage skeptic person.

Why isn't that an option?

Rather than making me feel like here's yet another place where ivgreen is forced to do something that she doesn't want to do because of someone else?

My entire life is that. 24hrs a day 7 days a week. My life is nothing but me doing things I hate because someone else wants or needs me too. And I hate it. And I wish I was dead because of it.

And I know that Sisyphus was happy during his task, but I'm not him. I'm miserable doing all these things that I don't want to do. And now it's like here's this other thing.

But I know what I can do all on my own the way I want. So maybe that's why I think of suicide all the time. Who knows. </TEXT>

Nevertheless I guess I'll do it at least until i've gone enough to justify me saying that it doesn't work and I dislike it. 

Tho tbf I probably just don't want to do anything that changes me. I probably do really want to kill myself and really do find cutting comforting and am scared that this program will change me in some way that I don't end up killing myself and I don't keep on cutting.

But today he told me that he thinks that DBT would benefit me best and that I should go to therapy with someone who does that. But I don't want to go somewhere else.

And I definitely don't want to do DBT. With all its stupid rules and group. Like gross I don't want to do that.

Nevertheless now I'm all sad because why doesn't anyone ever stay. Everyone sends me away and no one ever really cares about me. It's all bullshit lies. Everyone leaves. 

No one really cares.
I just am so tired of meeting people, letting them in and then they go. 
And I'm tired of not being able to do what I want.

It makes me really just want to die. But then that probably wouldn't fix anything. I'd probably just be like rejected from hell and heaven cuz I'm trash. Or whatever. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah definitely. It is hard with public meltdowns. It's weird how little I give a shit about what other people think now. 

I used to care very much about appearances. 

Now I'm like, yep that's my son who decided to take his shoes off in Denny's, what of it. 

It's weird tho randomly mentioning to people before they come over, that my son's probably going to touch them randomly to get to know them and also he is probably going to strip naked at some point so you may see a naked child at some point during the Superbowl party so you know just tell me and I'll handle it. 

But knowing why my son wasn't talking. Or why he only wanted to eat pasta and cereal. Or why he refused to eat away from the house. Was good. Because then you can develop strategies to deal with it. 

It does get better. And I'm not sure if that's just a things improve thing or a you stop caring so much thing. 

On one hand the more independent I see him get with his schooling and therapies does help me to be less worrisome about his future which weighs heavily on me. And also I have changed a bunch of my expectations of the parenting experience. 

I've definitely replaced West point graduate with him passing a community college certificate program in anything he's interested in. 

And I gotta say, it's probably for the best that he had autism. I'd probably have been a massive jerk like my parents with a bunch of overly insane ambitions for him. I've had a lot of time to work on my parenting skills and expectations for others and myself since then.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> At first it is. It take a lot more money, time, resources and more to deal with. 

For one, I didn't expect to be changing diapers 9 years later when I first had my son. It wasn't something I had planned on. And if someone had told me that I'd be caring for my kid for basically my entire life well into my elderly years (as is extremely likely) I don't think I'd have had a child. 

Now that I've gotten to know him and parent him and be friends with him. It's much different. When you are standing on the starting line, it's daunting. Like eating an entire elephant. 

You're gonna sit there and be like "fuck me what did I get myself into". 

It's normal to be scared. 

Now tho, I'd kill the person that tried to take him away from me. I'd work my hardest to destroy anyone who harmed him. He's my world. But that first day, month, year. It was frightening. 

And letting other parents know that it's normal and okay to be scared, and upset is good. 

I spent years pushing that fear and sadness away til I ended up a drunk. Because everyone made me feel like shit if I even mentioned a fraction of how I really felt. 

I reckon it's how parents feel when they have a daughter and wanted that daughter to be a ballerina and she's into trucks. Not on the same level, but there's some disappointment there because you had a plan and it didn't work out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It takes a while.

There was a point where I just wanted to die. I still do half the time. 

I drank myself towards oblivion for 2 years.

I tried hard to make everything work. To be happy and the person people wanted me to be.

People think that a kid with a disability just is overnight accepted. It isn't.

There's a large amount of me that hates everyone and everything because *MY Son* has autism.

I did everything right. I ate all the proper foods, avoided everything I was supposed to, did everything right. But alas I have a kid with autism and my ex friend who drank and did drugs while pregnant with both her children has normal kids.

Sometimes I hate God. Sometimes I fear I hate my son. Sometimes I hate my husband. And sometimes, I probably actually hate my son. A lot of the time I hate myself.

From 2012 to 2014 I drank while my son was at school and after he'd gone to bed. All the while wishing I could just leave and live in a trailer on a reservation drinking myself to death like I'd been told my father had done.


Even now, I constantly think about suicide. Every day, no matter how great or bad the day is. It often seems like the only way out of Autism. But then I remember that he needs me and I don't.


To get to the point where I wasn't just faking happiness and functionality, it took a lot of therapy.


It's going to be a while. He may need to talk to someone. He might never be able to deal. Some people take it harder. Typically men. Like they fucked up somehow. That's how I feel. Like I did something wrong and this is my fault. I logically know it isn't. I logically know that things don't work like that. But the brain is tricky. 

It allows you to know a logical thing but also know an illogical thing and still despite your brain yelling that it's not logical to think that you created this situation, to follow that illogical thought to the point of destroying yourself, knowing also that destroying yourself won't logically fix it and still working towards the idea that it will. 

Give him time. 

I seemed fine at first. I was the perfect autism mom for the first year or so. Exemplary. But eventually all that faking took a toll. 

If he's not taking it well at the start let him. It's best for everyone.

One on the legs, one on the body, and one on each arm. Plus they have a board. 

It's not great at facilitating happy feelings but ultimately it's not that bad. 

However I did take him with me once to get my own blood drawn and I think he remembered that for the next time and was less anxious. 

Maybe you can get some blood work done at the same time. And he can see how well you do.  </TEXT>

I've found that the love bears all things.

I literally love my son so much, I think if he became a zombie, I'd likely go all weird and feed people to him like in the Santa Clarita Diet. 

Lol. 

Good luck! Four months is probably the worst part of parenting in my opinion. The novelty has worn off and they still aren't fun enough yet. And in my case he was still a night owl so I was like tired and annoyed.

<TEXT> Today is the 7th anniversary of my son being diagnosed with Autism. I'm rereading some of the posts from that day, and it's almost like someone died. I guess technically the child that I dreamt of having (the one that would go to west point, and yale, and become a five star general) did die that day. And while it took a few years, eventually I accepted the child that I have. He's really smart, he can't talk, but he has his own distinct voice.

It wasn't what I planned, and that hard to get past even 7 years later. But, the journey with him, is one that is overwhelmingly positive. We both love science museums, books, and futurama. Plus he introduced me to Rick and Morty (My new favorite show). And ultimately we just mesh. Whether he be a future astronaut, cashier, scientist, or fry cook, he's my Corbin and that's ultimately all that matters.

<TEXT> Yeah i think you're right. There's like this hypomania / mania type part of me that wants to destroy myself. 

So i'll basically do anything I can to get to that point. be it ruining my marriage by sexting with random guys, or spending the rent money on video games and a thousand bottles of shampoo cuz it was a really good deal. Or being obsessed with drinking. 

Today i tried learning some salsa. so that seemed like a good outlet. and it was fun and didn't involve me hurting myself or anyone else with my actions. 

Thanks!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> trying hard to not make terrible choices while in hypomania [tw selfharm] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-16 21:41:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So in a temporary moment of clarity (basically i was talking with someone about their heroin addicted son and realized sometimes you have to 'snitch' on people to get them help that they clearly need) I realized that my psych and therapist as well as my husband might be right about the self harm thing. 

I guess I'm in like a hypomania state right now. Cuz I have tons of energy, I'm very focused on my goals, and I have some weird self destructive plans. 

Like I tend to super over spend and make tons of terrible choices. I get super angry, super quickly. And I become terribly obsessed with doing things like either drugs or cutting. 

so today I'm trying to work my safety plan. But I really really really really just want to cut. Like i'm not even upset, it's just like this thing i'm obsessing with right now. tho i do feel extremely lonely. but idk.

I tried the meditation, talking to people, and a few other things. I'm just idk nearing the end of my list and i really don't want to bother my psych. i'm always bothering him.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> IIRC he has both a PhD in psychology and a MD in internal medicine and psychiatry. 

  I mean spending an hour or more each week talking in detail about why you feel the way you do, in a way that's not geared at "fixing" it with medication

at the first session that we had he said the goal was to utilize both medication and talk therapy to address my issues and help me to live my best life. 

I mean, I'm not necessarily sure he's the best dude out there. Mainly because i'd much rather talk about other shit rather than the cutting. and he's kinda forcing me to deal with that first cuz he said something about the hierachy of needs and that saftey is one of the basic ones and cutting isn't safe. 

I'll research a few other people. Tho i'll likely end up not doing anythign because it took a lot to trust one person. And i'm sure i'll just sleep on it until it gets so bad i can't function before i do anything about it again.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can understand the keeping others alive. But isn't it my body? Shouldn't I be allowed to remove this body from the world if I deem it necessary. Or cut it if I deem it necessary to me getting things done. 

Til now I was sitting around laying around and wishing I were dead. At least now I can bear living enough to do things that make me productive. The house is clean, I'm baking, I'm doing extra shit that I don't have to. 

I'm super mom and super wife. 

I found a way to do that. And if cutting a few times a week makes that happen, I don't see how anyone has the right to stop me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> IMO it doesn't foster trust. 

If I can't trust my husband to not snitch then I can't trust him. If I can't trust him, then marriage is pointless. Trust is paramount in marriage. Now I can't trust him. 

And as for the doctor, now I can't trust him. I told him no, and he did it anyway. 

I don't forgive violations of my trust. So now, instead of being honest about cutting. I'm just gonna lie and say I'm good. 

Just like when I went to a doctor to help me stop drinking and when I kept failing to stay sober, she threatened to get my child taken away from me. 

So from that point on, I was only as honest as necessary. It was all surface stuff from then on. Nothing really big that might have helped me deeply. Yeah I was less stressed but the deep shit that I really needed help with, like the fact that I never ever stop thinking about suicide. 

I'll be having a great day and I'll think, "what a great day, I should probably kill myself and go out on a high note." 

But I couldn't tell her that because I feared that I couldn't trust her. 

Now I know I can't trust this guy. So now it's pointless to tell him anything more than surface stuff.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So i found this psych who was really nice and he seemed to click all the boxes that i needed clicked in what i look for. He was a similarish christian denom and political philosophy, he seemed attentive and intellectual and very nice. Someone I can easily talk to and relate to. 

Anyways, at first i'd been diagnosed as PTSD and Depression. He switched me from prozac to effexor. however, after about a week I got all happy and stuff. And i did make some weird choices like spending all the rent and bill payments (ie car payments etc) on random and not necessary things. Well, he said thats part of being bipolar and thought i was maybe bipolar. So he subscribed lithium. 

I was none to thrilled. anyway i got back into cutting but before i cut i called him up and was like look, i want to cut and my bff thought it was a good idea for me to call you. 

Anyways he called my husband to get him to check in on me and stuff. and then he said to try some breathing exercises and i was technically supposed to go into the hospital if i actually didn't think i was able to keep myself from cutting. 

I didn't do that shit. I just cut myself anyway, but not until later because i was good until i heard some frustrating news from my brother about my shit family. 

So i cut a little tiny bit. and that was that. and a few pricks with a pin and stuff. whatevers. 

So when i went to the appointment today he asked if i cut, i said yeah because i'm a fucking adult and it happened but i was over it. 

Anyway he decided to call my husband to let him know to lock up all the sharp objects and medications and stuff. And i feel like thats a mad violation of privacy. 

Like 1, i'm an adult. and 2, it fucked up.

then my husband like a fucking buster was like, oh let me tell you about her pricking herself with a pin. snitches on me. Anyway i don't even want to be married to him any more. 

Am i being rediculous. 

also i dont want to go back to the guy. But i worry if i refuse he'll like have me committed or something. 

any advice is appreciated. 

thanks in advance.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> thanks I think i did the beard backwards. I did like the white block and then tried to put in the black but that's good advice for the main colour as the solid colour and hten adding in the light colour like i was trying to do. I knew it looked wrong but i couldn't figure what i was doing wrong. 

and that's smart with the really dark background and then the other shades. I think that was bothering me but i was having such a shit time at figuring out what i wanted to do. Everything kept getting washed out but i couldn't figure out what was the problem and now i realize that it's the background being so light. thanks! you give good tips.

<TEXT> to make things easier lets say that I paid a bunch of money for some prescriptions. MY OOP max is 800. My deductible is 500. But I didn't pay more than 200 towards my deductible. The prescriptions cost me about 600 but don't count toward the deductible.  

Will i still have to pay the remaining 300 for the deductible or would I be exempt from that? or will i still pay it but get a check for the balance i paid toward the prescriptions?

Simple vector images are $5
Simple cartoon drawings like the KrakenOctodad are 7.50 and up

More seemingly realistic are above 10. 

Just a note: 50% of the proceeds are going to help me buy a bike for a needy kid. My new years resolution was to buy 12 bikes for kids with autism or that were needy. So i'm drawing pictures to raise funds for that.  </TEXT>

[](/critique) critique is always welcome. tho just to save some breath/typing i do know that some of the images aren't properly lined up. I'm going to work on that later when i do them more in depth. 

and 

if you're so inclined to suggest other bottles i may consider making more. i'm just not very smart about perfume.  </TEXT>

Is he doing well in school? Does he have appropriate housing? Are you able to provide for him? 

If all of those are met and you don't have some big actual opportunity lined up elsewhere then no, you wait til you do. Or you make an opportunity that's closer. 

Maybe move to a bigger city close to where you are now.

<TEXT> I went to counseling and for about a year she heard tales of me getting sober for 3 months and then relasping and such. Finally, after about a year of me not keeping it together, she said, i'd have to increase my level of help (get put on meds for depression etc and maybe go to outpatient rehab) or she'd notify child services to do a welfare check on my kid. 

So basically only after I showed no signs of getting better in spite of my halfassed efforts. 

So i increased efforts, took a few drug tests and she never talked about even involving them at all. 

From what she told me "unless you aren't trying and are actually a danger, they aren't going to do anything"  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Specifically, my son is autistic and as such he's going to be starting catechism / confirmation classes soon even though he's a bit older. I was wondering how in fact would he take communion. He's pretty adverse to certain foods / drinks. I can get him to take meds via dropper but idk how thrilled the pastor will be with administering the body and blood of christ via medicine dropper / syringe. 

anyone have any experience with that?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Advice needed - On actually setting up my New Years Resolution </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I had an idea a few weeks ago, that I wanted to try and buy a bike a month for a kid with autism or special needs. 

But then I have no idea how to go about getting the bikes and I'm not rich so I don't have gobs of money. And logistically speaking how would it be done. 

Anyways, anyone have any ideas on how I should set it up? Should I  just post up here whenever I have the funds for a new bike as like a contest type offer thing? or work with a local organization? 

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<TEXT> thats a good idea. I could probably make a sleeve using casting right? and shape it off the cup and then slowly transition to the newer model cup that he outright dismissed and then i guess something else thats more sustainable for the future.

<TITLE> Referred here from 3DPrinting Question about making a new cup for my son (xpost kinda) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-28 22:34:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My son has autism and drinks pretty much exclusively from one specific cup. Anyways, the company doesn't make them any more and I've reached out to them and they wont get back to me. And i'm not good at that whole let me go viral beggy thing like that other guy. he'll drink from juice boxes so he isn't going to die. But he will only drink specific juice from drink boxes.

So the people over at r/3Dprinting  said it would be hellish to attempt to 3d it. but that you resin people might know what i can do to make [these cups](https://www.safetots.co.uk/images/products/expanded/Tommee_Tippee_Explora_Active_Sporty_Cup_12_months_plus_xl_1.jpg)

I've still got the 1 original so I suppose i should be good. it's a hard plastic of sorts. 

If you think it's possible let me know. ANd if you know exactly what i should be using to make it, then I'll totally love you forever. 

**edit**: the need for the cup comes from his refusal to drink milk, water, or anything that isn't Sugary Fruit Punch out of anything but this cup. 

Thanks in advance. 


Also... I always wondered how people made their own action figurines and shit. Now i know, and now i'm going to become really obsessed with this for 6 months before abandoning it completely. 


Thanks!

<TEXT> It's called the Explora Sporty Cup by tommee tippee. It's just on it's last days. They redesigned the cup about 2  years ago. I had a few and now i'm down to the last one and these cups just don't hold up forever. 


I tried getting him to use the new ones and he basically noped them all.  tried straw cups, buying water and milk in juice box forms. Nothing. 

Thanks tho.

I was hoping this was maybe a possibility but recognized it might not be.

<TEXT> Knives if you do any amount of cooking. You don't realize it but using the wrong knives or shitty knives can really slow down the speed of making a meal. 

Jackets/cold weather gear. Buy a really good one, if you've stopped growing. I buy a mid range for my son since he's still growing. Unless you have more than 1 child. Then maybe buy a really good quality for the older one and you can pass down to the younger. 

An artificial christmas tree. If you want it looking real and lasting for long enough to not be a detriment to the environment and your pocket buy a real good tree. They can run in the 200+ range but if you wait til after christmas when they go on special (50 - 75%) off you can get a good deal on a tree that looks real AF. 

Choose the cheapest option: 

medications, since basically every pharmacist and doctor I know buys the acetaminophen instead of brand name tylenol (etc) I also always buy whatever is cheapest. 

kitchen staples, i've noticed no difference between Store Brand Real Vanilla Extract and the one that's 3x as much. same with salt, oil, butter, baking soda and the like. spices might be a trial and error thing but thus far I've never realized afterwards man I should have brought the super expensive salt.

<TEXT> the amazon ones are like 40 to 80. and kids just really fuck shit up. Especially a kid with autism. 

The ipads he had, he had for 2 years each. with maybe 3 trips to the apple store for each one. 

Plus IMO apple seems to be much easier for him to navigate. Very little literacy is required. He's 9 and while he can read a bit, he can't write / spell. So, something that is primarily click and be done with it, really works to his benefit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> if you ever have a kid or whatever, i suggest apple products. I brought my son an android tablet 2 years ago. In these past 2 years i've been through 5 different ones. 

not withstanding drops. (he usually has a cover)

I've had tons of random problems that were such a hassle to get resolved. Amazon fires randomly fail at the charger point for some reason. And while they're good about replacement sometimes its a pain in the ass as I can't just go to the store and say, "this is fucked, gimme another one" 

had a LG tablet. It dropped in case and while there werent any cracks the touch screen was all fucked up and they gave me a big run around about replacing it or repairing it.

<TEXT> Opposite problem. Grew up mid to upper middle class. Parents taught me fuck all about bills, budgeting, and money (in fact, any time I asked about any bill including the phone bill, which I was sure I put a hefty mark on with 90s phone service what it was, I'd be told that's grown folks business and to stop being nosy). Whenever I wanted something I got it (mainly because they used buying me shit as a replacement for being actual good parents). 


So when I became an adult for many years. It was like I'll just buy all this shit I want. And then later realized that you don't just always have tons of money to pay everything. Even after 15 years being out of their lock, i still randomly (read: when I'm depressed) forget that I have to pay bills before buying whatever the fuck I, my husband, or my child want.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Here's his list: Link: http://a.co/1Z2uycf

Originally everything was supposed to be super awesome this christmas but my husband got bit by a dog while delivering mail at work the first week of november. he got no pay for basically 1 month and they're still holding up the pay that he was supposed to get for the time off. They keep saying next week, next week. But its really really shitty. 

I have about 2 things for my son for christmas. But I was going to do all my shopping this week and they still haven't given him the back pay. I feel really shitty asking for anything especially since at some point we'll get this money. it just wont be til after christmas i'm suspecting. 

I wouldn't ask for anything but he really really loves christmas. He's been watching Christmas and holiday episodes of all his favorite shows since October basically. I just want him to have stuff to open on christmas. 

The list has a bunch of books and stuff, so they're no more than 5 bucks. 

I've got him a few things from 5 below like those pin art toys and slinkies, and I won a kmart giftcard for 30 bucks so I'm going to buy him a few little action figures. I was all set to buy him a huge train table but it was either train table or electric bill and electric bill won out. 

Needless to say. I just want the tree to have more than the 3 little things I was able to buy him under it. So it can sorta look like tv for him. not looking for much just really wanna see that smile. 

Thanks in advance!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> SV 

I finally lost nearly 9lbs. 

I've had fitness coaches, personal trainers, nutritionists and more. And i'd basically slowly lose like half a pound every two weeks despite massive adherence to the diet. 

Most times the nutritionist would have me on some diet of 1500 or 1400 kcals a day. I'd work out 4 or 5 times a week. I was basically throwing good money after bad. 

I even started taking metformin to try and lose the weight. And it just was a bunch of crap. 

Well, i still take the metformin cuz of PCOS

but I happened upon an article in a magazine that said that for people with diabetes and insulin problems (like with PCOS), keeping your carbs under 100g's a day would really help. Especially if you haven't been seeing any results via regular diet and exercise. 

So I did my TDEE and subtracted about 7Kcals from it, for my weekly caloric goal. 

I do about 1500 kcals M - Th and 2000kcals f - sun. 

And I keep my carbs between 100 and 125g a day. 

I'm sure i could go lower but thus far this has had some great results. I'm sure it's a first week fluke, but no matter what I tried in the past i'd at max lose about 1lb in a week. 

Anyway, hope this encourages someone. 

Here's a link to something about it. I couldn't find the original article i had read: https://www.pcos.com/blog/4/how-does-a-low-carb-diet-help-to-reverse-pcos/

That article is just about how to handle pcos with low carb diets. But since I basically wasn't losing weight cuz of the hormone problems with pcos, it helps. 

I'm going to continue to search for the better article about weight loss specifically.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most of the dreams I didn't follow are all tied up on having to make a decision about what to do since my child was disabled (autism nonverbal). 

I had to become a sahm and care for him because we didn't have and wouldn't make enough money to pay for the level of care he'd need from a babysitter. 

I regret not being able to move to Scotland and not doing a bunch of work and education related things like living on a reservation and learning the language of my forefathers. 

I'm sure I could shuffle things around, but if it doesn't work out because I have to care for someone else, I'm going to trust what my Pastor said, who's been when countless men and women as they died. 

He said not one of them ever regretted putting their personal goals aside because of their families. 

Now I'm just focused on making enough money to ensure  he does well. It's not working how I'd like, but I do what I can because it's important. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We eat a lot of hispanic food. So Arroz con Gandules etc, etc. 

Also a lot of pasta. 

Also money is tight as heck. So I'm trying to find a way to eat healthy but cheapish. 

So I need some help. 

I can buy a 20lb bag of rice for about 10 bucks. 

I need a way to add bulk to my plate without over blowing my budget. 

So currently we eat a lot of Potatoes, Rice, and Pasta. 

Any good subs? That are just as filling if not better. And also lower carb? I'm trying to cut my carbs to about 100g a day in a 1700 kcal diet.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It would accidentally effect the retirement of disabled adult children. 

Many parents end up setting up all kinds of venues of investments to sell at a later date for the benefit of their adult disabled children who will outlive them so they can afford round the clock care givers without being subjected to the hell that are many state run options. 

I have a few friends who brought land and stocks so that when their children are 80 or 90 they'll still have additional income so they don't have to live off the pittance that Social Security offers. 

This will effect those children. 

As far as my research has gone their is no tax free saving program for disabled children. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like IRAs are fine but what about people with children with disabilities? 

In order to provide them with a good standard of living you'd have to have multiple revenue streams for them to benefit from, including selling off investments that would be capital gains. 

Sure billionaires might benefit but not everyone is a billionaire and the people trying their darnedest to save a few million to last their disabled children til death would bear a decided amount of burden by having huge chunks of that money taken from them for taxes. 

Saving for your own retirement is hard as shit. But the limits for IRAs and 401ks aren't enough to save for both your own and a disabled child's old age.

     Harding referred to Newton's Principia Mathematica as a "rape manual" in her 1986 book "The Science Question in Feminism", a characterization that she later said she regretted.

I seriously have to read the reasons why she said something. I've not read the full of Principia Mathematica, probably just clips as they related to school. But from what I gathered it was just about the laws of motion and gravity and shit. 

I really want to find out how that = rape.  </TEXT>

If you're credit scores are high enough, do you think you'd be able to get a lower interest personal loan to pay off the higher interest personal loan? I'm not sure if that's a possibility in general, but if it is look into it. 

If you can find a way to sell / trade in your car and pay off the additional 4K that is of a lower interest rate than your car note at present I'd look into that. 

Also when did you have the baby? 6 months ago or more than a year? Have you adjusted your withholdings to reflect that? 

If you did have the child this year, you may get a few hundred to a few thousand in a tax return and can use that to pay off some debt.  </TEXT>

I've found a really good tool for making sure I work out. Google calendar app on Android phones (not sure about other iterations) has a goal scheduler. 

You pick your goal (exercise/walk) then what time of day you want to do it and then how many times per week. And it will set out reminders for you to do it. 

I like it a little better than just setting an appointment or reminder because it tracks how often you've completed it. And that is super fun. IMO.  </TEXT>

And it seeks to blame people and put a bunch of legalism on people for being upset. 

It's okay to be angry, and to ask why bad things happen. 

Being out of pain when you're dead is great but it doesn't alleviate the pain of today. 

If someone is dying from cancer and will leave their kids orphans, that isn't comfort. It's just a trite little musing about how they're totally sinful for being scared and in pain.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Infinite rewards and crowns for following him are all in the next life. Not here on earth. 

Jesus and the scriptures say multiple times (see 2 Timothy 3:12 and John 15:20 for examples) that you are guaranteed persecution for following Christ. 


Bad things happen because of man's fallen nature. That includes man's inhumanity to man and other evil which befalls us. 

There is no guarantee that he will deliver us from the evil that befalls us in this life. Many people have died while waiting for god to heal them. Many people have prayed for god to deliver the hem from murder or abuse and he hasn't. It's the unfortunate reality of life.

<TEXT> Well since all my bills, rent, food, car, insurance, and everything is covered by 80% of our income and we aren't on food stamps or anything like that then I don't see the problem.  

I get a few freelance gigs every now and then but not on a consistent enough basis for me to count it as income in my budget. 

I have a son who has autism who needs lots of care. I decided to stay home with him about 4 years ago because proper child care for his specific needs can be extremely expensive (like $20/hr). 

Meanwhile, after 4 years of no proper work, every time I apply to a job in my field I get, "We really liked your previous experience; however, you don't have any recent experience so we went with another candidate" This despite being in charge of Treasury management for a multimillion national company for ~3 years.

I'm currently in the process of applying to masters programs in accounting so hopefully my masters will trump my 4 years of stay at home momness. 

But even if I'm not rolling in dough, I think that if I'd normally only spend 80% of my income (and I'm not relying on food stamps to supplement my income) that I'm doing pretty well. 

Would it be better for me to be making 10k a month and spending 10k a month? 

I'm lower end of middle class I'm not in poverty. While I'd much enjoy additional income. I'd likely still have the same bills along with probably an additional expense for a caretaker.  </TEXT>

Insurance is available for pretty cheap depending upon your situation via the exchange. 

But for that specific situation, I went to a clinic and the supermarket pharmacy does discounted generics. So it only cost me 4$ to fill the script.

Normally, I'd have gone elsewhere, but our insurance hasn't started yet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah. Those are pretty terrible. 

I studied up on Stalin for my senior thesis and I eventually got into stories of him killing millions of people. 

Now, occasionally, you'll hear some stories from any of the many genocides of the 1900s. The ones you hear most often are the good triumphing over evil or good people who endured to be good in face of evil. The oskar Schindler's and people of that nature. 

However, the thing that stuck with me most in those classes was not the "how great that there are good people in this world."

But 

How inhumane we can be to each other. Humans are not good at their core. If they were genocides wouldn't happen. But they do. They do because at our base humans can do evil to others large scale without thinking. 

Like my grandfather told me once. He was in Germany after the war and yet not one person would admit to being for the Nazis. But that can't be true. Because they could have never gotten as far as they did without at least enough of the population to be so complacent that they didn't care. 

I've thought about it. 

I hope that I'd be the kind of person smuggling people out, hiding people in my attic, fighting for good. But honestly, just based on history, it would be more than likely that I'd be either so complacent I didn't care. Or I'd have done whatever benefitted me the most. And that's the horror of it all.

Basically if you ignore any problem for 6 years it's going to get worse and worse.

<TEXT> I went on an interview I was going to be in charge of a newsletter and I was like one of the top 2 candidates. 

So they ask: "what would you do if someone doesn't have their article in by deadline" 

I went into some long spiel about tracking them down at home to make sure that they weren't sick or injured. 

When I was done there was a long break in conversation and then someone re asked the question and specified what would I do about the article. 

I felt like such an idiot. Like that beauty queen who talked about how like May 7th was the best date, when she was asked to describe her perfect (romantic) date. 

I tried to recover from that, but I think that firmly sealed the interview for the other person. And I yelled at myself the whole way home. 

Of course, I had a perfectly good answer for that question, which was that my goal would be to always have prewritten articles on standby for such occasions. But after my first answer that probably didn't matter. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Initially, it was that I was drinking all day and then walking to the store and rebuying a case of beer and then drinking those til it looked like I had only had maybe one or two during the day so my husband would not know. 

However, it took a lot to get me to actually quit.


When I finally put that bottle down for the last time 2 and 1/2 years ago. And got serious about being sober. It was because after about a year or so of going to therapy and AA meetings, I still kept relapsing. 

And upon telling my therapist about how I nearly drank myself to death she said, basically either I get sober or she would try and get my kid taken away. 

I wasn't a shit drunk mom or anything, there was always food, clean house, stuff was done, but I would drink myself stupid after he went to bed. And I was basically just biding time til i got up enough courage to kill myself (which was probably true but I wouldn't have admitted as such then).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interesting. Tho even in the post you link it says that there aren't any real direct public statements for it. 

Like the 1922 quote they say can be dismissed as hyperbole. 

I've considered their argument, but I'm not big into conspiracies. It takes a hell of a big conspiracy to create evidence of a mass extermination. 

I'm almost certain that it would be miles easier to cover up the mass extermination, especially under the guise of war than to create one. 

It's really sick. It annoys me almost as much as the 9/11 truthers (which come in a few forms including international Jewish conspiracy form). 


We had a Holocaust survivor come to our class (she a classmates grandmother). She talked a little about deniers. I know that it seemed very profound at the time but I've forgotten exactly what she said. But the gist of it was that for the real deniers no evidence will trump their hate. 

Which I guess is true. I hate very few people in the world, but of the person I hate the most, you could bring me mountains of evidence about what a great person they are, videos of them saving babies in burning buildings, eye witness statements, and more, and I wouldn't allow myself to believe it for any reason.  </TEXT>

If there is ultimately no point why even try once things get to a point? 

Not saying, why don't you kill yourself now.

Not saying there aren't other reasons for not killing yourself, but why shouldn't a person kill themselves if nothing matters ultimately.

<TEXT> I remember we did a project on Holocaust denial in either middle school or high school (I'm thinking probably high school). 

We had to look up reasons why they believed it didn't happen and how they dismiss certain evidence.

So from what I remember:

1. The photos were faked by the Allied forces to make hitler look bad. 
2. The photos are actually from Allied prisons and camps. 
3. Hitler never directly said anything about the camps. 

I think there were even a few arguments against the actual places and such. 

From what do remember, my teacher said that it's actually easier for Holocaust deniers to not have to deal with proof now because there are very few first hand accounts anymore. 

It's very disturbing. 

I remember my grandfather telling me about how he had gone to Germany with the army for some time before Korea and he saw some of the camps. 
If i recall correctly he basically said that they didn't even talk about the Holocaust in America after the war like that. I think it took a while. </TEXT>

In my opinion it's worse because my grandfather told my grandmother to get rid of her affair child. 

I know that logically a woman can abandon her child just as a man can but I feel like somehow it's way more cold hearted to abandon a child that comes out of your body and then never acknowledge that she exists.

<TEXT> I found out that my grandmother had 2 children out of wedlock. 

My uncle (the oldest of 5 siblings) she had around the time my grandfather married her. He is not my grandfather's son. 

The second she had while my grandfather was in Korea at war. 

This kid was also not my grandfather's. However, because this kid was new my grandfather told her to get rid of it before he came back from the war or he wasn't coming back to her. 

Apparently she listened and gave this daughter to the father. 

What's worse is she then never ever acknowledged this girls existence. In fact if someone hadn't slipped up and told me about it, I would have ever known. 

Which explained why the oldest uncle (let's call him Ron) wasn't named after my grandfather. 

So my uncle Ron is first born (according to official family history) followed by my Mom (who has a female variant of my grandfather's name), my other uncle (Jr.), And then my two aunts. 

It also explains why my uncle Ron is like 6ft+, is skinny without trying, and everyone else is sub 5ft 11 and has weight issues. 

I already didn't like my family (they're world class assholes). But finding out that I have an aunt who my grandmother chooses to pretend doesn't even exist, really confirmed that they are shitty people. 

I mean, my grandfather is dead now, my grandmother is in her 80s. Everyone is an adult. Even if she just told everyone she's a cousin or something, I don't think at this juncture it would make anyone too upset. 

There's no reason why she couldn't just acknowledge her daughter a little bit. I spoke to my mystery aunt on the phone one day and she really seems to want to know her mother and that side of the family. 

Even tho she's well in her 60s. I'm sure she's made peace with it. But my god, even if I gave up a kid, I would like to think that I would at least sneak and acknowledge her existence.  </TEXT>

Other than the last person basically every other person that did it, I was like how am I even going to recoup that money. 

The most someone ever screwed me out of was $700. 

I thought about taking them to court but after I did the research I realized even small claims I'd have to out up $50 to file the suit. Then I'd probably have to do a bunch of legwork or pay someone to serve them the lawsuit. And in the end even if I got the money they owed all the hours of invest in it would eat up the money.  </TEXT>

Some people don't like that. They hate the idea of paying in advance. 

But the few times that people stiffed me wasn't worth it.

I had to pee but when I went to the women's room it was locked so I got my then boyfriend (now husband) to check that no one was in the men's room so I could go. There was no one so I went and came out. 

Now all the bathrooms were stall bathrooms so it was weird that the women's was locked. Anyway we go back to eating and talking. 

Some more women have to go to the bathroom so they go and ask the manager why the bathroom is locked. 

The manager comes up and unlocked the door and starts yelling. 

Then he pulls out this big black lady who's in like shorts and a tee-shirt with soap all over her body.

Not saying to jot file the back taxes, but having known quite a few people who either just lived off their parents or worked under the table and didn't do anything about it. The IRS doesn't come around asking why you weren't employed for X years. 

That being said. It would be smart to get ahead of it before there is some reason for them to come around asking about back income. 

IANAL but I don't believe that hidden income has a statute of limitation. So should he for some reason get audited at a later date and those years come up you could be in the shit. I'd speak to a tax attorney regardless and see what the best course of action was.  </TEXT>

The internet was out when i was in high school but it was still very much the AOL dialup thing and I was vehemently opposed to the internet for some dumb ass reasons. 

I remember I wanted some clothes I had seen in a marilyn manson video. Like one of those biker dresses that zippers all down the front. Well, I didn't know where to go for shit like that. I went to the mall. I looked in the yellow pages, and since most of my friends were regular teens that were into more normal stuff, they didn't know. 

So i basically just gave up. Until I happened to be sitting outside of a diner and some guy walked past me wearing platform leather boots, with a his hair cut like the guy from Orgy and  some other weird shit on. 

I basically ran up and tackled the guy and asked him where he got the clothes. Some of it he had gotten in NYC but he mentioned that he got some at some store in the town. He said he'd show me where and we went to the place together. We ended up becoming pretty good friends and I got my kick ass biker dress. 

Now i just google shit. And I have no friends. Seems like I was right about the goddamned internet. It ruined everything.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> it wasn't the joke that ended the relationship. It was the resulting argument. 

Like she got into this whole, "You should be grateful for your son and that you get to be there for him."

and I was like "The fuck?!? Grateful? I love my son, but you couldn't possibly understand the toll that it takes one me." 

and then she like got into her whole bullshit about how hard her life is. which is laughable. I'm sure it's hard but chick got like 100K divorce settlement and her ex (who is an asshole) pays for private school for the kids. 99% of the problems she has are her own doing and not a shit roll of the dice of life. 

And I'm sure divorce isn't fun no matter how much money she had. Like I was there for her thru all of it. I alibied her when she was stepping out on her man. I helped her move. I babysat her kids. All kinds of shit. 


What ended it was really when I said, "If I can't make jokes about how unjust it is that meth heads can have perfectly normal kids and yet people that do everything right dont with You my bff since high school, then who can I?" and she said "Idk maybe other parents with kids with autism." 

In my opinion that was just a really nice way of saying: "Go fuck yourself".

I remember that I saw the nurse that initially told me it was just a cold and to relax one day while I was grabbing food from the cafeteria of the hospital. He ended up being in the hospital for like 10 days or something. 

I was like, "Hey, my sons just up in his room now hooked up to an oxygen machine because he was so sick that he needed to be admitted."

I hadn't considered looking at pricing now. Or anything like that. 

That would really help me to ballpark the amount needed. Cuz there are all kinds of calculators to estimate future value. 

Thanks. 

Also yeah, I thought about all that stuff with additional children. 

I definitely didn't want to have them feeling less loved cuz I knew how that felt growing up. I was orphaned and taken in by family, but you could really see the difference in how much they cared for their actual children vs me. And i definitely wouldn't want my kid to feel like they were born to care for someone else. 

It's a serious problem. And something that always gives me pause.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's not true at all. I very seriously couldn't handle my son having autism. It took a fair amount of therapy for myself to get over my want to just pack my shit and leave. 

After he was diagnosed, I got him every possible service he could, but as things got worse and I realized how much more help he needed, I got depressed. I started drinking. I got very very very obsessed with suicide and just leaving my husband and son and only having a financial obligation. 

Someone eventually noticed and helped me out. But I very well wouldn't be able to handle it now if not for outside intervention.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's because they don't realize how hard it really is. 

I remember my sister in law would always say things that basically insinuated that I was just being lazy and a victim about my kid having autism. Nothing outright like that, but essentially suggesting that I dont make momming my focus. She has 3 kids and I only have 1. 

I'm trying to think of a decent example. The best I can think of is she once kinda got on me for not making everything from scratch. Like I buy premade pancake mix, meatballs shit like that. 

So basically, since she has 3 kids and makes all her shit from scratch that I should have the time cuz 3 kids has to be harder than 1 kid with autism. 

So she watched my son for me 2 times. 1 time he was pretty good but needed a little extra attention so no big deal. The 2nd time was more challenging, I believe at one point during the 4 hours she was watching him he decided to take off his diaper and pooped on the floor and then tried to clean it up which just kinda smeared it on things. 

After that day where she watched him she hasn't had such an attitude like she did before. I'm sure she still thinks I could do more, but I think she finally realized that it's not the same.  </TEXT>

Most people have a plan for their lives, even if that plan is have kids, send them to college and retire. 

A special needs kid will likely ruin those plans. They might have wanted 3 kids and after the first has a disability they decide not to have more. Life isn't in shambles but their plans are ruined.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah, I see. 

I am definitely not a huge fan of the tests. 

But I didn't realize how much emphasis they put on them. 

I think when I was in school that the big thing was you can't even really study for it. It was just, you either know it or you don't. 

They should go back to that or something like it. 

I know that the big push was to find out if the teachers were quality. 

But that's not a way to measure quality.

I could make anyone memorize 2+2=4 and get them to perform on some test and say that. But a real measure is finding out if the kid knows why. 
A good teacher can teach that and I don't see how many tests could test that. 

At least not if you have to teach like how you're doing to get them to pass it.

<TEXT> To be fair, unless you adopt a child that is already old enough where you're sure they don't have a severe disability, you won't know right away anyway. Most people adopt young children (like sub 3). And for most it's not obvious that a kid has things like autism until over 2 years old. 

And even then it isn't a guarantee that nothing else will happen. One of my facebook friends is friends with someone who had a very bright normal child. And then one day they were at the park or something and a really heavy tree fell on the kids head. The kid survived and is alive but last I saw he's still in a wheelchair and they are making every effort they can to regain the abilities that he once had. I dont think he can talk, he can barely communicate, he's very much severely disabled. 

And idk even what someone would do at that point. Even if they could just give a 7 or 8 year old up for adoption while still keeping their other non-injured child. That would definitely make them the biggest pariahs ever.  </TEXT>

Cuz I remember having to take like this thing called the IOWAs or something every year, until that changed to something else I think maybe the MATs or something. 

And we still did all that stuff. I'm not a teacher so I'm not saying I know all about your job and how it works now.

<TEXT>  One day it hit me that none of that ends. That's your life until you die.

minor correction: that's you life even after you die. 

I don't mean like haunting and such. But I'm more afraid of what happens after I die than what happens up to that day. 

Like assuming I myself don't end up with dementia or something. Unless i have another child (which isn't even a guarantee of them giving a shit about their sibling) there will be no one to check on him after I go. 

I know many people who have or had elderly parents who had dementia or alzheimers and had to be put in homes. These people weren't like super poor that they had their parents in like super cheap state run homes or anything. But even in what were supposed to be good nursing homes, they still had tales of finding out that orderlies were stealing from their parents or not caring for them as they should. 

Knowing that my kid will likely live to 100 and I think the life expectancy for someone my age is about 80. When I'm 80 my son will be 55. That means he'll probably live another 45 years from then. That's 45 years of life that I have to hope that one of his cousins, maybe (if i can have another child) sibling, family friend, church friend or something is going to be around to make sure that he is being treated properly by people who are paid to look after him. Not to mention that I have to hope that some kind of social safety net is in place for him or that I could ever hope to have saved up enough money to last well past my own death to his. 

Maybe if there were like really good robots i'd be able to relax. Honestly, super intelligent robots and Trumps nuclear holocaust are the two biggest hopes for my future. Robots because as long as it's programmed appropriately a robot won't have the capacity for human style neglect and abuse, so i wouldn't have to worry. 

And in the case of the nuclear holocaust everything will end so no future to worry about. ;) (LOL)

<TEXT> Just cuz the special needs doesn't turn up until later doesn't change how sever it is.

My son was diagnosed around 15-18 months old (1.5 years). He was considered high-functioning up until about 4 or 5. He didn't have language, he did the toe walking and hand flapping, he didn't do eye contact and such. But he could do a lot of stuff for himself. He would go get what he wanted (so he could tell you what he wanted), he knew how to use tablets and dvd players to an extent. 

However, even with us getting all the speech, aba and special schooling for him for the first few years of his life. His language barrier really has turned what seemed to be High functioning into maybe middling. He's still very smart, but he's almost 9 and still in diapers. There's many things that he can't do because of language problems.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I know that feels. 

And I know how shitty it feels to feel that. 

Like you can't tell anyone you know things like that. 


I remember telling a friend once. That I wanted to have another kid and joked that in order to ensure that the kid was normal I'd drink and smoke the entire pregnancy. This is a joke because when I was pregnant with my son I was stone cold sober (was one of those evangelical Christians that don't drink) was taking prenatal vitamins cuz I get anemic and prenatal vitamins basically have everything you need to counteract that. And while pregnant I was super serious about everything that doctors and baby books said to do and avoid. 

Anyway, my friend called me a monster and what was a 15 year friendship was ended then. 

Not cuz of the joke persay. But because when she got upset about the joke and said that jokes like that aren't acceptable and why I'd even joke like that. 

Well I said I joked like that because I did everything medically appropriate while pregnant and she smoked weed and drank during both her pregnancies. And yet my son has autism and she's got kids in the gifted and talented program. And her response was I should be thankful for what I do have. But I don't see how being thankful and being upset can't co exist. 

I love my son more than anyone else, but at the same time, why can't I also hate that he has autism. Hate that it's not the parenting experience I'd like to have had? 

I'm sure if I had to get my foot cut off to save my life I'd be happy that I'm not dead, but I can also be upset that I don't have a foot anymore. They aren't mutually exclusive.

<TEXT> Why can't you just do both? 

I know that tests have changed, but we had standardized testing when I was in school and we still did stuff like this. 

I remember for every subject in science, math, english, and history(social studies). We'd have one long project that went along with the theme of the chapter/section. 

I remember we did mold on sandwiches when we learned about fungus. We grew plants, we did research. And had lots of fun and at the same time we learned all the parts of a whatever. 

My favorite was from middle school. We were learning about cells. And the big project was we were going to make our own cells. 

In the mean time we learned about mitosis, what mitochondria was, RNA and DNA, shit like that. And after learning each part the teacher would have us brainstorm what kind of food stuff we could buy that looked like it. 

I'm sure I'm missing something but it just seems that testing as onerous as it may be doesn't stop people from doing these things.

<TEXT> When I was in high school, there was this kid with special needs. I think a middling  autism cuz he definitely didn't have downs syndrome. 

All my friends were kinda dicks to him. And apparently he used to touch himself in class, and so it felt justified to do so. 

Anyway here I am 16 years later and my son has autism. He's 8 and he often gets naked in inappropriate situations. People can be dicks about it. Not like, "Oh your kid is naked" but like kinda mean about it and about him. 

I fear that when he hits puberty that he'll probably not realize the boundaries of how you shouldn't touch yourself in public. And that kind of thing is for home in your room or bathroom. And because of this normal kids will treat him like shit. 

Also even tho he doesn't touch himself now, people especially kids treat him like shit. 

Took him to Vacation Bible School and the best class that would work for him was the 5 year olds. So he's 2 years older, anyway some of them didn't want to touch him during group games (like ring around the rosie and stuff) 

At the park i've heard kids say, "Don't play with him cuz he's too stupid to know how to talk"

From his cousins I've heard, "Why does he have a baby's brain"

These effect me probably more than him. But Occasionally I think about that boy from high school and how he must have felt and how his parents must have felt. 

side note: When I heard the comment from the kids at the playground (which wasn't said to my son but between themselves) I had to grab my son and leave the park. I was like seconds away from saying some devastatingly fucked up shit to a 6 year old.  </TEXT>

But if he's like a drunk or something who'd say sure tickets and then be the kind of person to hock them somehow for drugs, I'd not bother. 

Tho possibly instead of relying on him to come to them maybe do a whole family trip to that state during the summer if you can and let them hang with him and you do something else.

I am an alcoholic. But I couldn't stop until I wanted to stop. You can mention the weight and how it's hurting her. But she's not going to stop until she's had enough. 

And don't feel bad if you can't continue along with her on that road. 

Just cuz it's weight and eating won't make you a jerk for saying "I'm not going to watch you do this to yourself and I have to go." 

I hope it doesn't get to that point but honestly don't feel shamed for not wanting to be around for that. Cuz diabetes and all the obesity related diseases can become really gut wrenching to be around. 

Just like when I was drinking, things weren't that bad. I'd drink but basically I was the same person I am now, but I wouldn't have blamed my husband for saying, "I'm not going to watch you kill yourself with booze" 

So don't blame yourself if you can't watch her kill herself with food.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When a bad thing happens it's also because of those same two things just the opposite (bad luck and doing something incorrectly). 

My kid has autism, why? Bad luck. Genetics or not it's bad luck that I have those genes i certainly did everything medically appropriate while pregnant. 

I got into a car accident once, why? Because I wasn't paying attention to the road appropriately. So I did something incorrectly. 

It's just as appropriate to ask why me for good and bad results or whatever. However, when I'm thinking why do I have a million dollars, people don't consider it self pity but introspection. But if I'm thinking about why I can't afford groceries, or why I have a disease, people do consider it self pity.  </TEXT>

I don't remember the enchanted but I wasn't a huge fan of that movie. IIRC that movie was the one where the chick came from fairytale land to NYC? If so I hated it because it was like heavy handedly about how women can do whatever they want.

Which is fine, but I just don't see too many movies about how men can do whatever they want. In fact, I believe this was around the time Disney really started pushing the motivational Girl Power princesses trope. 

But I notice that they don't have anything similar for boys. Boys need role models and people saying they can do anything they put their minds to as well. 

Also not a huge fan of Enterprise. Tho i haven't watched it.

<TEXT>  Infuriated at the double standard, I am incentivized more to try to relax and enjoy this experience. I pull my book out for a distraction.

What the hell is she talking about? There's no double standard other than her own mental hangups. 

I'm a chick. I'm also overweight. I'm also not going to go to a nude beach because of my own mental hangups about being naked in front of strangers. But I'm also not going to go around acting like it's some weird double standard. 

 As we almost reach the end of the beach, a stalky, silver-haired nude man probably around my fathers age approaches me and says the rest of the beach is too rocky to go down. He may have very well had good intentions, but after a lifetime of being approached by creepy men, a small voice in my head says, He wants you to stop here so he can see your tits. I try to ignore it. 

So now this dude is some kind of creeper because he gave her advice? Could he have been a creeper? Sure, but maybe he's just a sensible dude who gives advice to newbies at the beach. She seems rather on edge about EVERYTHING.

Also I read the bikini one that she wrote http://archive.is/7DU6R

She seems to have upped the bitchiness in this nude beach one. However, she does seem to be slightly upset at people for looking at her in that one too. Of course people are going to look at you, you're outside and in a bikini in NYC AND you have the number 30 written on your stomach and the 3 is backwards. I'd look at her weird too.

<TEXT> I didn't say it to say he's selfless. He's a massive dick. The point is that not all megachurches have salaried pastors. And what do his finances have to do with his brothers and sisters? They didn't write his books. If they're doing a job they deserve their salary. And it honestly isn't anyone but the organization and their donors business what they're paid. 

Yes, I specifically wouldn't want to donate money to some place that gives their  employees an obscene amount. But it's not the governments job to say how much they can pay people. 

In fact a very small church might get in maybe 100k a year from members or less. If they pay their pastor 1/3 of their take its still only 33k a year which while better than min wage isn't nearly what a person with (at least in lutheran circles) a Masters degree could make. 

Heck if they take in less they could be paying 1/2 to the pastor and giving him a 25k a year job for a position that in many churches is 6 days a week and always on call. 


Also for politics, I said if they are taxes they would likely then start giving money to candidates and funding campaigns and such. But again big if. 

That doesn't mean that because they might if they're taxed get political that they are now. I've been to a lot of church services and I can only think of 2 overtly political things that I've heard. 

1 is I've heard Lutheran's pray as. Part of the order of service for the protection of the leaders of their state. Local and federal government's. Which is just what they do in general at basically every Lutheran Church worldwide. 

2, I heard someone preach about how jesus went into Egypt and how it's terribly unchristian to vote for people that want to deport illegals. 

Other than that I don't think I have heard much about any voting ever in a church setting. 

Now, I've talked to pastors about what they think about this politician or that based upon biblical principles. Or if this economic system or that is more Christian. And they've made their beliefs known, but that's their right as a free being. They weren't preaching from the pulpit or anything like that.

<TEXT> Am I complaining? I don't see where I did that. Im just saying that having a highly stable family will yield better results more often. 


If Warren buffet was born into poverty with an absentee father and abusive mother, he wouldn't have had the same results. 

Just like my grandfather, he had jobs starting at like 6 or 7. And there were definitely other kids with the same breaks as him who didn't have jobs and weren't motivated. So yes, his determination did matter. But while Warren buffet was able to save that money and did it for fun, my grandfather did it because if he didn't he might have to wear worn out shoes with holes in their soles. Or he might not eat. He didn't have the luxury to save his money and even if he did, I doubt anyone that he knew would have been able to tell him how to even buy a stock or bond. 

Or take my kid for example. My son has autism, I get him every service I can. But while celebrities with autistic kids can say, I'm gonna get my son 20 hours of speech therapy a week and just plunk down a check like nothing because they have tons of money. And then worry about the insurance company covering it later.

I have to go thru all the government wait lists, I have to apply for grants, I have to take the services that I can get. 

So you know, maybe my son and Holy Robinson Pete's son had the exact same type of autism. But my son is definitely not going to have the same type of outcome. 

Why because his parents aren't rich, and that other kids parents are. 

Sure, yes, I totally agree, that success does involve the individuals work ethic but some of it is entirely based upon socio economic concerns. 

And even the most motivated dude might not even do anything. So what was he not motivated enough? Did he not try hard enough. No, there's a fair amount of luck that goes into some things. Like the guy that sold his stake in Apple, he had his own personal problems that came up and so it didn't work out.  

All's I'm saying is right now there's probably a junkie with wealthy parents who dropped out of high school who's still getting high and doesn't have any life ambitions that is going to die wealthier than me. That whenever he decides to do something with himself will have funding to do it.

But half the time I'm not even certain that even if a massive opportunity came up I could afford to take it. 

Shoot, I wanted to do some volunteer work in my field during the summer but couldn't do it because I can't afford childcare. That would have helped me tremendously with getting into grad school or just an actual job after having not worked for a few years.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, I was going point by point as to what they do that isn't inherently religious that other 501 3c organizations do. 

And many people keep saying that churches should be taxed just like for profit businesses, so I addressed that as well. 

I've no problem with them filing but this idea that they have to justify what they do. 

Like even if a church was just a bunch of people believing in their religion and donating money to continue to do that. It's still an entity that exists 



As for the politicalness, most churches aren't nearly as political as you think. Unless you're considering any mention of any issue that can also be considered a political issue. 

The Bible teaches caring for the sick and infirm. Is telling members to do what they can for the sick and infirm even if it means voting for candidates who help the poor political speech? Is preaching about what the Bible says about homosexuality or taxes political speech? 

What about schools and sports organizations? They too engage in political speech. Schools will invite politicians to speak on campus or ban others based upon their political views? I don't see anyone saying these entities should also lose their tax exempt status. Sure Harvard isn't going around proclaiming vote for X but they definitely do do very political things. And even if the head of the organization doesn't many teachers liberal and conservative do so in their own class rooms.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Did I say that he didn't do any work himself? No, I said that having wealthy parents likely helped. 

Also he had a stable home environment. And apparently a grandfather that would employ him. 

Yeah my grandfather worked hard and had all kinds of jobs as a kid. And that's his personality and drive for success. But even with all that hard work, he still didn't have

And he definitely had decent success in his life.

But what about the kid who has to drop out of high school because his brothers and sisters will be homeless if he didn't. 

Sure buffet did all that stuff cuz he wanted to but when my grandfather had a paper route at 12 it wasn't because he just wanted to make money and could save and invest. It's cuz his family wouldn't eat if he didn't. 

Not a lot of room for him to invest in businesses when he has to feed his brothers and sisters. 

Warren buffet was able to invest in stocks and bonds and whatever because he didn't have to worry about feeding anyone else even himself. 

Is it possible that he would have been just as rich had he been born a poor black dude during Jim Crow? Idk maybe. But you can't just say that he had the same hurdles as anyone else. 


Am I doing terrible? No. But meanwhile, I've never been arrested, I have a degree, and I have significant trouble getting even jobs at convenience stores. Maybe I don't interview well, but I bet if my parents owned their own business that I could just work at my finances would be a hell of a lot more secure. 

Shit I have friends who's parent have money who have records but they own houses, they have jobs and more. Why? Because they work at their fathers business. 

Sure I had a few really great opportunities that would have given me a great heads up on my career in publishing. I was offered an unpaid internship at rolling stone. Unfortunately, I couldn't take it because I needed to work to not be homeless. But I guess i wasn't motivated enough. Should have just been homelessness or something.

<TEXT> Some members don't deduct their donations. And some members don't donate money. So youd have a lopsided list at best. 

Not to mention, that now the government is pulling those members information to get their financial information so they can then tell the church how much to pay their employees. 

Would this only apply to churches or all non profits? Cuz unless it applied to every non profit it would be discriminatory.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Please see my other comment about all the things that count as a 501 c 3 organization. 

Reading, education, preservation of antiques and more all count. Religious education is still education. And it doesn't have to be an accredited school to count. Unless you're going to say only certain formats of education count. 

Almost every church service involves a reading and education on what that reading means and how to apply it in society. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For one applying biblical principles to your life.

It's not like they say, so jesus said render unto ceaser that which is Caesar and unto God that which is God's. 

And then nothing else. 

Depending upon the pastor or preacher.that verse could become a sermon on why taxes are good, why you should pay your debts, why you should get saved, why you shouldn't be rich, I'm sure there's more. 

A sermon on the verse that says there is no Jew or Greek in Christ would inspire all manner of sermons on equality of the races. How to treat immigrants, etc. 

The Bible talks about a lot of moral issues that are relevant to politics and general everyday society. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just cuz he is exceptional doesn't mean that a large part of that didn't come from his family being rich. 

If you could clone him as a child and give those kids to two separate families, one with money and one in government housing. It's more likely than not that the one with the wealthy family is going to have better opportunities and be better off in the end. 

For example: I come from a town with alot of rich people. 

I have friends who had similar grades as me in highschool similar sat scores, and things of that nature. On paper we'd be about equal. 

The kids with rich parents are doing well better than me. Even the ones that didn't go to college. 

Some got into colleges because of who they knew, others didn't go to college but, their dads financed the shit out of their passion. 

I on the other hand, had to go to jr college ,then regular college, I had to take out student loans, I had to work and go to school, I didn't have the luxury of taking lots of internships or hobnobbing with the go to people. 

So while Richy Rich is an associate editor at Penguin cuz he got to do all those internships and his dad knows a guy and I'm taking whatever job I can get even if it isn't in my field because I have to make rent. It puts you on a path. 

When you don't have to worry about material things like rent because you've got a well funded family, it makes things way easier. 

If my parents had paid for my education, I could have went to any school that accepted me. I could have gotten better grades in college because I didn't have to work. I could have taken unpaid internships over the summer because I didn't need money. 

Sure there are plenty of people that come from poverty and become super rich. But it's not some easy shit to do.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also the politics thing is pretty shaky because some people would consider a pastor talking about how racism is bad from the pulpit is politicking. 

There are loads of politically themed Bible verses. There verses about taxes, prisoners, how people should be treated, the death penalty, and more. 

Yes it's a bit wishy washy on the endorsements, but what are you going to do. Go around and send government officials into churches to listen in on services? 

Also what is and isn't acceptable political speech apart from direct endorsements? 

Telling your congregation that the Bible is against abortion and as such they should remember that when picking who to vote for will definitely sway someone from voting for a prochoice candidate over a prolife one. But that isn't prohibited. 

And you couldn't prohibit it either. Because how are you going to prohibit it? Tell pastors they can't use specific words? Can't mention anyone in politics? What then do you do about all the churches that as part of tradition pray for God to protect their countries leaders? Is that political? Is it not? Who decides?

<TEXT> You can't enact that. 
For 1 barring Joel osteen and the MC mansion guys. 

Let's say a church has been around for quite some time. So they own their building and have a home for the use of the pastor. 

Well, maybe their congregation is a ton of people are mostly poor and as such either don't own homes or don't own high value homes, but the church owned parsonage is worth a ton because of its location and the housing market. So what, now they have to sell that building just cuz their members are poor? 

Also, it seems quite an invasion of privacy to enforce something like that. In order for the church to comply with that law they'd have to give over a list of all their members to the government. And idk if I want that kind of prying by the government. 

Yes the government knows where you live and yes you pay property taxes. But now, the government has to know what organizations im a part of in my free time? Also, now I apparently have to give information about my personal finances to my Church? 

Also, that would have to be applied across the board to all kinds of non profit organizations at the least. 

Look at Harvard and other big universities, often the Dean will be given a home to live in ( the Dean has to pay rent to avoid declaring it as income on his taxes but nevertheless). I'm fairly certain that most buildings that Harvard owns are probably valued at way more than a majority of their faculty can afford, not to mention the students. 

Think about it, if you're putting this oversight on value on a church based upon members home values then that means that everyone counts. So all the students, the faculty, the janitors, everyone would now be a metric for deciding how expensive a home they can provide to faculty? Idk if that's a feasible idea.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> adding to what /u/behlski said: 

It's also only the individual that has to pay the taxes on the use of the car based on their personal use. The Church can still buy the car for them, and they will still use it, but it would the minister himself that has to file his own taxes. No new law would stop that. 

It wouldn't stop them from giving Pastors houses, allt he pastor has to do is pay 5% of the value for rent to not include it as his own income. But the church can still do that. 

There are already rules in place to stop the primary benefit of the pastor or manager. 

I've had friends who worked at big companies who were provided a car that the company leased and an apartment that the company owned. And as long as they worked at the company they could stay in the apartment and drive the vehicle. 

Look back to Ted Haggard, when he was ousted as pastor of his church following his scandal, he had to move from his home and give up his car. This was because he was no longer the pastor at the church. 

While I'm sure Creflo dollars church would collapse if he left, Anything that the church owned that he used would no longer be available to him. They might allow him to buy the things from them for some kind of discount, but he couldn't just keep them and have the church own them. 

These kinds of abuses happen all the time even amongst regular non-profits. 

I know of people who create their own family non-profit to give a child a job. They often do some good as well, but maybe the Grandfather funds it and his grandson is the head of the foundation and draws a salary. It's perfectly legal as long as the non-profit was created to do something other than give Grandson a job.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Just because churches do some charitable stuff does not mean they are non-profits as the law would requires for any non-religious organization.

Actually here are [the exempt purposes for a 501 c 3 organization](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exempt-purposes-internal-revenue-code-section-501-c-3) (emphasis mine)

 The exempt purposes set forth in section 501(c)(3) are **charitable, religious, educational, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, fostering national or international amateur sports competition, and preventing cruelty to children or animals.**  The term charitable is used in its generally accepted legal sense and includes **relief of the poor, the distressed, or the underprivileged; advancement of religion; advancement of education or science; erecting or maintaining public buildings, monuments, or works; lessening the burdens of government; lessening neighborhood tensions; eliminating prejudice and discrimination; defending human and civil rights secured by law; and combating community deterioration and juvenile delinquency**.

Here are things that most churches do other than just being religious: 

* Are Charitable (Give out goods, services, and money)
* Are educational (Teach church history via church services, bible studies, religious rites, and membership classes)
* Literacy (They read the bible during service, Many churches offer ESL and Adult literacy classes, some dont explicitly but will when they see a parishioner in need)
* Preventing cruelty to children or animals (Churches promote the general welfare of children as a moral issue)


*From just the definition of charitable definition (again not including religious exclusive wording)* 

* Relieve the poor - they donate money, time, and goods to the poor (even if it's just among their own members)
* relieve the distressed - pastors regularly provide counseling of a non medical nature to their members and the public, they provide meditation (prayer), and kind words to those in distressing times. 
* Relief to the underprivileged - Churches often work as advocacy agents for the under privileged (see MLKjr and other civil rights era church leaders, see Catholic agencies and their work with the disabled and tremendous amount of work with the intellectually disabled, see LGBT affirming churches and their work against HB2 and for Equal Marriage Access)
* Advancement of education - While it is largely religious (not every church has an actual school) all churches do teach religious history and literature some also teach music. They do this not only in non church related services but also within a church service As a typical service involves reading the bible (literature), discussion about the history of the teaching and how they relate to daily life thru preaching (history), and education in music via worship music (often times hymns from Bach etc.) 
*Maintaining public buildings, monuments, and works - I can't find the link but I think the Catholic church has the largest collection of art in the world, They maintain historic buildings that are open to the public (Older churches), and they preserve high quality stained glass from artists of the past. 
* Lessen the burden of the government - Any money, goods or services they distribute amongst the community. Checking in on elderly adults to see how they are, providing counseling to members, helping members learn to read, giving members rides and assistance
* Lessening neighborhood tensions - Providing activities for members of the community to interact and get to know each other
* Eliminating prejudice and discrimination - Not including LGBT issues, a majority of churches do work to at the very least eliminate prejudice and discrimination of the disabled, the ill, and the elderly. 
* Defending human and civil rights - Prolife churches believe they are doing that, Historically Black churches believe they are doing that, and Also just in and of itself the free exercise of religion is that
* Combat Community deterioration and juvenile delinquency - A kid that goes to church in a poor gang ridden neighborhoood is likely not going to be a kid that is also in a gang. 

I dont think the current law is "flagrantly granting special privileges to religious entities": 

If anything churches in and of themselves are a special entity. A Church does a whole lot of different things where as the average Charity doesn't dabble in multiple trades. Planned parenthood might give low cost or free medical care to women but they don't also have a huge store of art, give money to poor people, teach people how to read, provide community togetherness and maintain public buildings. 

Not to mention this whole idea of them having to prove their worth to the government. Also they aren't like other for profit entities. The lutheran church down the block isn't the same as the car wash up the street. Barring a scam church most churches are in the business of providing a benefit to the community, depending upon how big the church is that community can be as small as 10 people to as many as whole countries. For profit entities exist to make a profit and return that profit to shareholders. 

Plus if a church is going to be taxed, then they're going to get extremely political. Which means where they might have said "Vote for Prolife candidates" they're going to just straight up get involved and make their will known. Which will probably make candidates more religiously inclined than not. Even if they aren't the richest organization in the world, the catholic church is likely in the top 10. You don't think that once they're being taxed that they aren't going to start donating tons of money to prolife, procatholic, candidates? Is that really what you want?

<TEXT> Creflo dollar is like the worst possible example. 

But you can't just pick and choose which ones are taxed. 

Like the government can't say prosperity gospel churches are taxed but these ones aren't. 

Just like they can't say, health charities are tax exempt as long as they arent antivaxxers.

It would be nice, but it would be ripe for misuse. Especially because political leanings of all 3 branches of the government change constantly. 

If they can punish certain speech or beliefs they'd be able to punish others.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have to say in general I don't see why they don't require them to be transparent with their funds. 

I've gone to churches that aren't and I churches that are. 

I went to an evangelical church that would kinda tell you what needed more money but wouldn't easily release how much money they took in from tithes and offerings and such. 

And I've been to Lutheran churches who not only make their financial information easily accessible to anyone who wants to know. Post the prior weeks take of all incoming money including tithes, offerings, donations, and income from people renting out facilities, in the weekly bulletin to all members. But they also give out statements to all the members of their quarterly income and expenses. Plus they vote on the pastors income, raises, and major expenses. Some even vote for if they should accept a large donation (especially if it is something like to be used for this 1 thing). 

It just seems sensible for them to do it. 

And would help them to be more organized. 

Not on a scale as big as a church, but I have worked with a student group to raise money for something. So we sold candy and just took in donations and stuff. 

It got really hectic when we first just kinda stuffed all the money in a jar. Eventually we had to start counting money, recording it in a journal and stuff. Not to mention we had to figure out if we were making money off of selling candy. 

I'm sure most churches have utilities to pay, rent or mortgages to pay, and they are supposed to send their donors statements at tax time. 

So I don't see how they couldn't just fill out that form. A good church should have all that information anyway. 

And honestly I don't see how it would be burdensome to fill out a form. It's not like it's a background check and they have to wait 10 days to do church stuff after they file it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It wasn't meant as a maligning thing. It was just a contrasting fact. It was just the one that I happened to have picked. 

Just cuz he takes/took a large salary doesn't necessarily mean that he didn't deserve it nor that he's a dick or something. 

I'd consider him (based on no knowledge of the guy) to be a better human than Osteen. Even if Osteen doesn't take a salary from the church. Just cuz, he doesn't seem to do the deceitful and dishonest crap osteen does. 

I've no problem with a charity paying their employees competitive and even excessive wages. 

If paying the CEO 10million a year is what keeps the guy that has helped reduced expenses, increased donations, and increased the effectiveness of the charity every year they've been there then go ahead. 

If they're paying the CEO 20k a year and the charity is doing worse they're wasting funds on a terrible employee. 

All that is to say, my intent wasn't that the Goodwill is bad or the CEO is bad. Just that not all megachurch pastors actually take any money but that many charitable organizations do pay their leaders a hefty sum.

<TEXT> I don't necessarily consider them gaining wealth to be hypocritical. Wealth in and of itself isn't a moral thing. 

Yeah sure, there's the story where Jesus tells the guy to sell all his belongings and give them to the poor. But then there are also all the biblical stories of God blessing people with money as a reward for their faith or obedience or whatever. Like Job was rich as heck, lost everything, but in the end he was doubly rich because God blessed him more for being faithful. 

From christian specific morality, it's more the love of money that is immoral. 

Sure Joel Osteen and his ilk are more than likely well in love with their money. But, just having a shitton of money doesn't necessarily make a christian a hypocrite. I know of many such rich people who while they have a big fancy house and drive a BMW or whatever, also give well over the "required" tithe to charity. 

For example, Mitt Romney (whatever you think about him politically aside) does give more than 1/3 of his annual income to charity. He's not a pastor but he is like a Bishop or something like that. Sure he's blindingly rich, but he's also pretty generous. 

And that guy that wrote the purpose driven life that was all the rage like 15ish years ago [\(Rick Warren\)](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/morgan-guyton/rick-warrens-economic-principles_b_1464954.html) apparently gives like 90 percent of all his income away to not only his own church but also like HIV/AIDS programs, and programs for the poor.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anything political? 

That's a bunch of crap because EVERYTHING can be political. 

Where I live most of the homeless shelters are run by churches. So they'd more than likely have members, pastors, and churches that are all looking to get the local (at the very least) government to create laws and services that help these people get better jobs or whatever so they won't be homeless. 

So now you're saying well, if they decide to hold a rally or join someone elses protest about the government cutting benefits for the poor, all of a sudden they lose their tax exempt status that they were very well using to benefit tons of homeless people that the local government isnt? 

All 501 c 3 organizations are involved in other peoples lives. And many of them "spread lies and brain wash people". You have [homeopathic 501c3 organizations](http://www.homeopathycenter.org/), [anti vaxxer 501 c 3](http://momsagainstmercury.org/), and I'm sure if I look into it there are probably ones for a flat earth, chemtrails, and other such nonsense. 

Also the no politics law extends to all 501 c 3 organizations. This includes groups that work with the disabled, that help unwed mothers, planned parenthood, and more. All of those organizations have reasons why they'd advocate political things. If Politician A and Politician B are both running for office and Politician A wants to end medicaid waiver, why shouldn't the organization for the disabled say "Vote for the candidate that supports medicaid waiver." Why shouldn't they be able to protest the things that they are against? 

Besides you couldn't even enforce that anyway. All they'd do is break up the two entities. And technically, you don't really need much money to hold protests. They'd just break it up into 2 parts one would be a 501 C 3 and the other a 501 C 4. Which is what many 501 C 3 organizations do any way. 

Planned parenthood has both a 501c4 and a 501c3 the c4 can conduct political activities and the c3 technically can't. 

There's no rules that say Church A can't give money to Charitable organization B. So any rule as such would just have Westboro baptist breaking up their organizations into 2 separate entities. A protest entity and a church entity. 

Not to mention that you can't police their protests. If Pastor Bob wants to go and protest planned parenthood on his freetime as a free citizen of the US he can do so all he wants. So can the other members of the church. 

What are you going to do, tell Pastor Bob he can't do what he wants as a private citizen just because he has this other job? Seems a massive violation of civil liberties. And that wouldn't just end with pastors either. It'll trickle down to tons of other jobs and organizations. Not to mention it'll be policing specific free speech. 

Sure everyone has a problem with westboro baptist and the way they go about their activities. But what about all the churches that banded together and protested North Carolinas HB2? Not the ones that were against Trans* people in bathrooms, but the ones that were there to advocate with the LGBT commmunity. Do they also lose their tax exempt status? 

What about the churches that joined with milliions of the LGBT community to create momentum for equal rights? Or all the historically black churches that worked to fight racism? Remember Martin Luther King Jr. was as a profession a Pastor of a church. And he used his religious beliefs as part of the reason why he was fighting a largely politcial fight for equal rights of people of color. 

So yeah, you want to stop the Westboro Baptist church but you'll also stop the MLKjr type churches too.

<TEXT> Hi,

I think I've literally tried all the advice for hard-boiled eggs and 9 time out of ten they always come out like this: http://i.imgur.com/5IYGCUz.jpg

The peal always gets stuck and rips the egg up. 

Here's what I've tried:

1. Eggs in cold water, bring to a boil, and then wait. 
2. A little vinegar in the water
3. Boil eggs the entire time, take out run under cold water
4. attempt" to peal them while their still warm
5. Peal them the next day
6. Don't use new eggs, use eggs that are at least a week old. 

So those are the things I've tried. 

Sometimes using any of these methods will work. But most of the time they don't. Last night I did the bring to a boil, turn off, and then wait til the next day with old eggs (over a week since purchase) and that's what is pictured above. 

Anyone got a fool proof way to hard-boiled eggs that look nice? 

Most of the time I'm making egg salad so I don't care what they look like but occasionally I want to make deviled eggs and they don't look nearly as appetising when they're ripped to shit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be fair, even mega churches do have charitable organization entities within them. 

I went to one when I was younger that had begun it's ascent to megachurch status. (They'd just purchased a very large parcel of land for a campus). 

And even though they were raking it in, they did provide a level of charity that the small 50 member church couldn't. 

They gave like 100's of thousands of dollars to some charity in Guatemala. Provided inner city children with backpacks and school supplies. They operated a college scholarship, and gave out a few checks to kids for private school at a few local Christian academies (which even tho Christian were vastly better than the education a lot of the kids would have gotten in Newark public schools). They'd even just write  random checks for members (and to some extent people in the community, with verification and some investigation) for financial difficulties. 


Even at the small church I attended years later, we didn't have that many members but when my husband broke his leg and we didn't have money for groceries and were waiting on food stamps and workers comp to kick in, they just have us like 400$ to live. 



****

As for people getting rich from megachurches. It sucks, but many of those megachurch pastors don't even draw a salary from their churches. 

For example: Joel Osteen hasn't taken a salary from his church since 2005. Nearly all of his millions come from his book sales.  http://www.howmuchmoneytheymake.com/public-figures/joel-osteen-net-worth-and-salary-lakewood-church.htm. (I'm on mobile right now so I'll properly format the link when I get to a computer).

Meanwhile, the CEO of goodwill takes like a 3million dollar salary. 
https://www.thestreet.com/story/12877842/1/you-wont-believe-how-much-these-10-nonprofit-ceos-get-paid.html

However that trollacious dick Creflo dollar does still draw a check from his church and won't even say how much it is http://mobile.nytimes.com/2006/01/15/nyregion/preaching-a-gospel-of-wealth-in-a-glittery-market-new-york.html?referer=http://rare.us/story/exposed-creflo-dollar-and-7-other-black-pastors-whose-net-worth-is-200-times-greater-than-their-flocks/.

So you know it isn't all cut and dry and it definitely would be hard to implement and enforce. </TEXT>

He's been doing code academy and stiff like that in his free time. And the price difference between the boot camp is negligible.

The college would be about $9000 depending upon the credits. While the 2 boot camps in the area are between 8 and 13k. Plus the other guy said that boot campers don't come out too terribly well prepared.

<TEXT> My husband hurt himself on the job a while ago and it looks like we're going to get a decently sized settlement. Not millions but somewhere between 30   75k.

We are going to pay off all our non student loan debt, which isn't much. We're also going to put aside 3-6 months of current expenses and a little for a vacation. but not sure what to do with the rest.  Which even with the 30k should be over 10k. 

We've a car loan that could get paid off

But we could also put 10k+ down on a condo or small house in our area and stop throwing money away to rent. Or something. 

The 3rd alternative would be paying for my husband to get a second degree. He has a BA in political science but wants to get an associate's degree in programming for some reason. (You can tell I'm not really behind it). 

We don't have great credit, but according to most advice we should qualify for a FHA loan. 

Just not sure what's the most sensible thing to do. 

Other facts: I'm planning on attending a Masters programme in 2017. Our kid does have autism. My husband hates his current job. And I might want to move to another state once I'm done with school in 18-36 months.

But here are the options I can think of listed. 

1. Pay off car
2. Down payment for home
3. Computer programming degree for husband
4. Just squirrel it away for later
5. Towards some of the student loans
6. Blow it on a world trip and hookers (joke)
7. Something I haven't thought of.  </TEXT>

I wasn't aware that there were all these rules to being a member of ethnic groups.

My son is like even less than that cuz his father is hispanic. Yet he still gets mistaken as black from his looks so it's definitely part of his culture. So what me and my son aren't black because it's not enough percentage wise for you?

I hate when people say that shit about how "This person isn't really X ethnicity/race" because of their looks, their lifestyle, their whatever. 

Like my husband is hispanic but he looks more Italian than anything (which while still an ethnicity people just blanket that shit under white). Also I've heard our last name for italian people as well as ecuadorians so if we do some geneology we'll probably find some Italians or something. 

And it's funny because he was trying to be a comedian and he was always getting people that said he should do like ethnic comedy like Mencia and Chapelle (am I the only one grossed out that I used them in the same sentence?) but thats not really his thing. 

He does have the stereotypical big loud hispanic family, but he's more of a stereotype brooklyn dude, who just happens to really like pernil and mangos. lol </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's cuz he focused on churchy crowds. Christianity can bring in lots of cash. I remember watching some of the plays that eventually became the  first few Madea movies on tapes at my religious in laws house. They were terrible but funner than any other Christian focused show. Notice Christian movies are very rarely comedies, so he found a hole and filled it. 

His aren't straight comedies, they're more like comedy/dramas but they aren't too heavy on the religion and they've got enough meh laughs. But during that 3 year jaunt when I was a evangelical, I'd look for Christian comedies and there really weren't any. It was all Christian apocalyptic movies, and shitty evangelical dramas. The bulk was Madea movies. 

So basically, if you just want to make money or are a Christian that wants to become middling big in film. Make decently produced Christian comedies.  </TEXT>

I don't need any of that other stuff. 

There's a training program in my area that gets your animal ready for search and rescue the whole training is about 2500 

I have to do a fair bit of the "homework" with the animal but I'm not really doing much else so I don't really have a problem with it. 

I know that a lot of service dogs are trained to help with this thing and that and turn on lights and things of that nature.


I saw autism specific service animals and they costs like 15k. And I can't help but think a fair amount goes to buying animals from breeders which seems terrible since there are all these unwanted animals in the world. And a lot of them tend to make good tracking dogs. 

But I'll think about it. Thanks </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you live alone it can be hard to want to cook at home. But I find the best way to create a habit. Is gradually. I know that science says 21 days and it becomes a habit but I like just adding it little by little.

So if I wanted to cook at home everyday, I'd probably just say every Monday I'm gonna cook. 

Then every Monday I'd make dinner. Even if it's just meatloaf every Monday. 

Then after 2 weeks I'd add in Wednesday

And so on and so on. 

If you do that by week 10 you'll be making dinner 5 days a week.

<TEXT> I'm part of a shitty shitpost group on Facebook. 

Anyway whilst in the group I made some comment that apparently was badass and this dude proceeded to become very enamoured with me. 

Whatever, I'm bored and lonely enough to entertain it. Plus who doesn't like someone to sing your praises all over the fb. 

So he friends me. I typically don't friend random people unless we've talked a lot slot before or we've got a mutual friend. Not cuz I'm very private or whatever but because Ive got a fucked up sense of humor and don't want to deal with arguments from people who don't like it. 

So now we're friends. This guy publicly on Facebook is the biggest sjw, feminist ally, GLBT ally, BLMer. 

Like I'm not even joking like the dude posts constantly about how women aren't objects, Gets all pissed at the hypocrisy of schools that send girls home for spaghetti straps, tells dudes to not rape in his posts. Like super PC. I'm not even exaggerating. 

However, via pm he's like (and knows I'm married and not interested) "you're so sexy" "I'd make you squirt" and "let me tell you about my sexual prowess" 

It's really creepy and annoying. I've taken to unfriending him but he's still like friends with friends of mine somehow, I guess he weaseled his way into their lists. 

The worst part is I'm not very good looking. I'm quite overweight, and I'm a massive jerk.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I reckon either those friends are also jerks. Or he tells them some wild lie. Like he thinks she's cheating and he wants them to let him know, or she's been saying some wild suicidy things and he needs people to keep an eye on her. 

I remember I had a friend like that in highschool it was a girl but she'd say these things like "I think he's cheating, can you let me know if you see him this weekend" 

Or 

"He was saying some really suicidal things and I just want him to be safe." 

It always seemed weird to me. Also I'm a jerk friend cuz I'd just tell the dude like "this chick said you wanna kill yourself, is that true? No? Okay cool" or "You still with this chick? No? Okay cool." </TEXT>

<TEXT> You know what truly helps people with mental health issues? Actually medical intervention. 

Prayer might help.
Exercise might help.
Therapy might help.
Medicine might help.

But if you go to a physician and tell them your symptoms, and get help for suicidal urges, they can monitor you so that you don't end up dead because your prayer didn't work. 

I get it God helps people. I'm a Christian I believe that. 

But when I had a 5cm tumor in my uterus, I didn't just pray it would go away. I went to a physician. God gave mankind education, knowledge, and skill to be able to help other people. 

Yes, when I was going under for surgery, I asked my congregation for prayers, I asked my pastor, my friends, my family, to pray for my recovery and for my health. 

But I went to the doctor because I had a medical problem. And that doctor was able to monitor my health and make sure that I didn't die. 

Now maybe God would have done some miraculous healing without me going to the doctor. But, I relied on the gifts that he bestows upon others to heal me. And thankfully that worked. But there's no harm in praying for healing and help and going to the earthly services and providers. 


I love God. I know that he watches over us and provides to those in need. But if I'm starving and can't pay my bills, I'm not going to just sit around my home and pray. I'm going to go get food stamps and welfare, or food banks, and charitable organizations. Why? Because God gave humans abilities to help other humans and sometimes those services are his way of helping us.

What kind of jerk move is that. 

Oh, you might kill yourself well don't listen to this sound advice about seeking medical help cuz the bill will make you wish you had kill yourself. 

Thats almost as bad as "pray the depression away"


You wouldn't tell someone who has severed their finger to not go seek medical help because it might be really expensive. You wouldn't give that advice to a diabetic with super high blood sugar, or someone with all the symptoms of a heart attack. But people always say that stuff to people with mental health issues. They're just as serious. And if op ends up dead tomorrow from his own hand because he didn't want to maybe be saddled with a medical bill, this dude is to blame.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Uh, I'm not going to argue about any of that. All I am arguing is that you don't have to do anything extraordinary to grow an infant. Idk how you got that many people don't do any of those shoulds to me arguing that women should be forced to carry infants to term. You're reading wayyyyy to much into things. 

Yes in 2016 people often take extra steps for pregnancy. 

But in 5000bc I doubt they did even half of what we do now. 

Nor did they in 35ad. 

Point being that people don't have to see expensive doctors or buy special clothing. 

I didn't buy special clothing when I was pregnant, I just brought larger sizes. Which is what anyone would do if they have gained weight, it's not some undue burden. It's just a fact of life.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've given birth. Please tell me how me saying that people don't have to do anything while pregnant = they don't have to do anything while giving birth. 

Also, watch any episode of "I didn't know I was pregnant" those women typically didn't know they were pregnant did absolutely 0 of the things you're supposed to do and the baby still grew. 

That isn't a 100% of the time you don't need to do anything. It's that even without any intervention by the mother a child will continue to grow to term without any outside influences. 

Ex: if I get pregnant and decide not to see a doctor, to eat shit I shouldn't, to smoke, and drink, and do whatever I want. There's still a very good chance that the baby will grow to term. 

All I'm saying is that you don't have to do anything to make your pregnancy viable. I know many people who have tried to have babies for years, done ALL the right stuff and still ended up miscarrying. And then you have crackheads who smoke crack and do all the wrong things and carry a baby to term. Now how healthy that baby is is obviously dependent upon further examination. But without outside Intervention a embryo will often continue to term. 



For example: if I buy a model airplane kit and don't do anything it won't become a model airplane. I have to act in order for it to become an airplane. 
With embryos unless I remove the embryo from the womb it should (barring other factors) continue to grow to an infant. Sure there are things I can do to make sure that infant is healthier, but even if all I do is have unprotected sex and get pregnant and then do nothing else but live my life how I had for years before, I can end up with a full infant in 40ish weeks. Not so with the model airplane, I have to do something to end up with an airplane. There's no natural progression from boxed kit to model airplane that doesn't involve human intervention. </TEXT>

Just like. If a man breaks into my house and I deem it a threat I can shoot him. 

He could just be a lost man with no intent to harm me, but he's in my house I deem it a threat it's a threat. I can still be made to op answer why and the authorities can attempt to charge me with something based upon those answers, but ultimately the use of deadly force is based upon whether or not you believe there is a threat.

It's slightly different with cops but almost essentially the same. The exception is the can use deadly force on people fleeing a scene if the think that the person might harm someone else. As a regular citizen if a criminal is leaving my home I cannot shoot him because he might return later to kill me, I just have to be ready for later or rely upon the cops to protect me. 

Cops can shoot a fleeing suspect if they believe that he is either going to harm someone or comeback to harm someone. 

The important thing here is "believe". Yes, one should try not to kill someone who isn't really a threat but if they seem to be a threat thats enough of a reason to use deadly force.

<TEXT> Even if that's the case, it doesn't make situation A a situation where racism was the factor. 

In my op I even say, I dont see how people immediately make that choice that it's racism. 

That would be like me taking statistics that show that rapists rape redheaded women at a higher rate than blondes. And being like well, this guy raped this chick because she had red hair. 

Hair color could have never been a factor in it. Why then should I say well statistics show redheads are raped more than blondes even though there are more blondes. 

Why can't the guy just be a rapist and not a redhead hating rapist? Why must I jump to the position that if a redhead is raped it's because of hatred against redheads? 

Just like in my op if a black person is shot it's all of a sudden because this cops are racist as opposed to "this cop is bad" or "cops need better training" 

Look at black lives matter. It's all about race, it's not "we need better policing" or "Stop Bad Cops" but they automatically make it a race thing. 

Sure if it's a race thing that will come out eventually, but I can't accuse a specific situation of being racist because of other situations.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is possible that training may need to be adjusted. 

However, my view wasn't that they could be it was that, it's obvious upon the initial situation and not after an investigation that it's racism. 

Yes, I can if given evidence say, oh this shooting was because of racism. 

What I can't do is say, this shooting that just happened 2 days ago is because of racism. 

I can even accept someone saying that covert subconscious racism is in play, I might disagree but I can accept that as their opinion based upon history. 

My problem is that if news breaks right now that a white cop shot a black man and the black man turned out to be unarmed. You'll see people like black lives matter, or others immediately say, "this is because of racism" with no evidence to prove that. 

Even the name of the movement purports that it's because of anti black racism. 

I'm all for, let's investigate, as I think all shootings should be investigated. 

I just can't get to "this shooting is most likely because of racism even tho no evidence proves as such.

The 24 hour news cycle? And the increased militarization of police officers. 

Now, I have a huge problem with the militarization of police and the increasingly large US vs THEM mentality with the police force. And you can even see it in many areas. Especially the last few years, I've noticed police are very much more suspect of people average beat cops not so much, but they are more "on edge" but I don't consider that a race thing and more of a militarization of police thing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Isn't that then just a bad cop. Rather than a racist cop? What is the deciding factor that turns a cop covering up their bad intentions to its racist. 

I don't deny that cops can be either racist or bad. But what creates the assumption that this bad thing they did is because the cop is racist as the first assumption. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think there is a large pool of bad cops nor of racist cops. 

But what I don't see is how you seem to think that bad equals racist. 

If I'm a bad person, I can be a bad person and not racist. I'm not also a racist because I'm bad. 

If a cop is bad, he's a bad cop. But there has to be some extra evidence for me to say, this cop is a racist cop. 

If a cop shoots an unarmed man and it turns out there was not compelling reason and that man is white, is that cop a racist or just a bad cop? 

Even if I were to automatically assume that every suspicious police shooting was a bad shooting and the cop was wrong. That would rise me to the level of "these cops are bad cops, there should be reform in Training." 

Yet, in all these shootings people seem to go "these cops are racist cops, they need to be trained to not be racist" which is the leap I just can't take.

<TEXT> A law can be unjust, all laws should be moral. 

Stealing is wrong not because the law says so but because it is morally wrong. 

Slavery being legal was immoral and an unjust law. Laws are based upon morality and what is just to the person and society. 

The big question you have to ask yourself is if prostitution would be just to society and the individual. 

If prostitution being legal reduces all human trafficking, then maybe it is just as it ends a morally reprehensible practice. 

But there is a good chance that mostly poor  women will end up prostituting themselves. And even with very strict laws about condom usage and testing many will end up with diseases. See any of the HIV outbreaks in the porn industry. 

While it being illegal doesn't stop poor women from being abused and exploited. society accepting prostitution would most certainly create a system where if a girl is poor there is immense pressure for her to sell herself for money. 

It will most certainly end up into a system where people are oppressed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, I can see unknown racism to be impactful. But even if that is the case, then how does one then say, "this cop did this because he's a racist and it was unjust" 

I just can't get to that, I can see your pov that racism might play a part. But I'm struggling with where it becomes "this situation happened and it was illegal because the cop is a racist" 

I just can't make that leap that says a possible subconscious racism suddenly equals a purposely racist shooting. Or that it's not a good shooting because of possible racism. 


I know it was years ago but there was a guy in NYC who the cops sodomized with a plunger. But the main cop in it was I believe married (might have been engaged) to a black woman. Yet everyone has that as racist. But I consider that just a corrupt, perverse, asshole cop. Maybe if he had said racist stuff in the past I could say, well this illegal thing he did was because of racism. 

But like the CCW guy I think Castile(?) I can't say it was a good shoot, and I know I err on the side of cops and think well maybe he reached into his back pocket without being told to do so. Or maybe the cop was overly scared for no reason and as such shouldn't have been a cop. 

I just don't see the part where, I accuse the cop of doing it because he's a racist. And say that it's because he's racist.

<TEXT> But then why are the majority of my interactions with cops nice? Even when I was being a dick to cops most of the time they treated me just like anyone else. 

When I broke the speed limit I wasn't treated shitty, the cop even asked how we enjoyed out Trip, we had a bunch of Disney stuff in the car. And I was doing some felonious speeding levels. And he didn't even write the ticket for the full speed to give me a break. In fact he even gave me a good defense for the ticket, so I wouldn't have to pay it. 

If racism was as big a factor as it is then I'd have way more stories of cops treating me like shit. And I lived in the projects, and dealt with cops in the projects where stereotypes would dictate,m that I'm a criminal black person. But they never treated me badly. 

The worst I've gotten was cops that were overly by the book and snippy, and they were snippy with everyone.

<TEXT> But then okay, I'll say maybe societal racism is there. But imo, that still doesn't rise to, "this shooting is because cops are racist". 

I just don't see how people can automatically just say, "officer Bob here who came to this scene where this black guy had a gun and used deadly force, is a racist and did this because of racism." 

I can say, how unfortunate. I might even be persuaded to agree that it's possible that unconscious racism took a part, but I'm not going to call a shooting murder and unlawful based upon something someone isn't even aware of psychologically.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Idk I just don't see any evidence that police aren't trying to treat everyone the same.

Even if they aren't, I just don't think that they are doing it consciously and I don't consider that racism. 

Even in these cases where black lives matter got involved, I don't think any of them came back with courts saying that the cops involved were racist. I might be wrong tho. 


Again im not saying all cops arent racist or that they're right. But even the autistic shooting, I'm like "this cop is a bad cop" and not "this cop is a racist cop"

I'm not a person who thinks all cops are super awesome, I've met some super dickish cops. But if I have a shitty interaction with a cop, it just doesn't automatically hit me, oh, this cop is a racist. I just assume he's a dick.

I guess I can see how people can say these cops are dicks, just not these cops are dicks because they're racist.

<TEXT> Well, If someone says that a person is a criminal because they're x, y, z race then that would be racism. 
If someone says something like, "I hate blacks" copious use of the N-word as a derogatory thing. Or other slurs would be racism. 

If someone said, so and so shouldn't do that because of their race, i'd think that was racism. 

I suppose, I'd consider it racism if someone said, "this person is good at X because of their race". As long as it wasn't something sensible like, This mexican guy is good at speaking spanish cuz their mexican. I mean without context, that seems sensible. If the guy was from mexico, it would just be logical that he would be good at speaking spanish. If he's born in the us, it wouldn't. And even if it were racist for someone to assume a hispanic person speaks spanish, i wouldn't consider it to be racist enough that I'd call that person a racist. 

My husband is hispanic and his grandmother assumes that he speaks spanish and he doesn't. I dont think she's being racist for doing so. And I don't think that when we go to spanish restaurants that they're being racist for immediately talking to my husband in spanish (I speak more spanish than him). 

I wouldn't consider it racist if You were faced with 2 potential employees both with the same skills, work history, and interpersonal skills, and you just happened to pick the person of X race because you perceive them to be smarter, but wouldn't be able to verbalize that was why if asked. If asked why you chose person A over B, and you said because Asians are smarter, that would be racism. but if it was because I just thought person A was smarter and didn't immediately know why, that's not racism. 

Idk if that helps.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Deadly force can be used if a suspect is considered to be dangerous and is resisting arrest. It's not ideal obviously as no one wants to end another human beings life (mostly). 

I guess I can see how, IF the police department has been in the last 25 years known to do racist things, I could see it. But I don't think you see that kind of information in these reports. 

I dont think the NYPD has a history of being very racist, at least not in the last 20-25 years. And yet people just assumed that they purposely killed that cigarette guy because of it. And I lived in staten island and I've never encountered any racist cops.  </TEXT>

Maybe if every cop was given this ambiguous object experiment test prior to hiring and while it wasn't included against them it was just in their file and it could be looked at when people claim racism? 

Idk maybe it's that Every single cop I've met has been not racist. I've gone into cop stations at night to ask to use their bathrooms and phones. I've had cops just take drugs from me and tell me to get it together. And 90% of the time they are white cops.

<TEXT> I get that idea, but if it isn't overt then I don't see why they would go around actively wishing for these people to be charged.

It just doesn't make sense to me that people would riot, march, and call for people to go to jail, and when they aren't indicted cry racist jury. 

If a cop shoots a person, I'll think well, lets see the facts. And if the facts include a person resisting arrest, then I assume the cop did what he felt was the right thing and there should be no problem. 

But it seems that whenever a cop shoots anyone who's black, it's HAS to be racism. And I don't see how you can get mad at something that someone doesn't even know they are doing. 

Lets say I'm automatically suspicious of black men because of societal racism. If a black man is tresspassing on my property and I shoot him, and it turns out he was just drunk and lost. I didn't shoot him because he was black but because he was on my property. Is it possible that I might have maybe hesitated for a few more minutes if it was a white man? Maybe. But I don't think I can be considered a racist for shooting the guy. 

It wasn't motivated by race. 

I just don't see how people can call for people to be prosecuted and jailed, and ruin their lives based on something that they don't necessarily have control over. Especially in situations of life or death. 

Lets say, same situation a man is tresspassing on my property but now I'm thinking, "Oh, this is a black man, and I don't want to be racist and just shoot him" So instead of immediately acting I don't do anything and try to solve the problem some other way and then it turns out the guy is there to cause me harm and I end up dead. 

Cops can't just go into a call, be told the suspect has a gun, and then try really hard not to use deadly force because they might subconsciously be racists.

<TEXT>  In this specific instance, they shot a black man who was pretty clearly unarmed and cooperating rather than the white man the suspected had a gun and was ignoring their commands. In that view isn't it clear why people are suspicious of the officers actions, and the component race played?

For 1, everything I know about firing a gun and about police training proceedures is that cops are taught to shoot to kill. You aren't supposed to fire your gun unless you're trying to kill someone and the cop shot him in the hand. I mean, maybe he's a crappy shot, but it seems as tho he just fired his gun. So isn't he just a really shitty cop. Shitty =/= racist. 

Also consider that most cops don't ever fire upon anyone, let alone kill anyone. I just dont see any proof as to why these people are automatically racist, it's like 2016. I don't really think most people born past 1970 are racist.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Even still, that still doesn't mean that the shootings are racially motivated. 

Even if I thru society perceive that asians are good at math and then am faced with a decision to hire Either the asian accountant or the white accountant, is it really me being racist if I hire the asian accountant even if they both interviewed well, both went to the same schools, same grades, and everything is the same? 

If they aren't aware of it, then I don't consider that racism. 

I just don't see how it can be racism if they aren't actively racist people. 

Ex. Like one of my uncles who was a state trooper is in fact a racist, he never really liked my husband who's hispanic (didn't overtly say anything, but I've heard him say degrading things about puerto ricans in the past and even after I had been dating my husband, been enganged, and was married). And I know he hates white people, cuz he said he definitely will be more strict (before he retired) with a white person who he stops than a black person because he dislikes white people. So if he were to shoot a white man in a police situation, i'd say, this was probably racially motivated. 

But many of these cops, in the situations that have occured over the last 2 or 3 years, have black friends, many had nonwhite spouses, most had no history of racism or misconduct. So I don't see how it can be racism.

And I definitely don't understand why people just automatically say, this has to be racism.

<TEXT> I'm the child of a family of cops. I have 10 uncles who were cops in various areas including (Military Police, DEA, Port Authority, State Troopers, Homicide Detectives, Sargents, Heads of Departments, Deputy Chiefs, and more) all of them are black. I have a bunch of friendly cop experiences, I knew a bunch of white cops from my town all of them were really nice to me. And I wasn't always the most law abiding person (I'm a recovering Alcoholic and Addict). Even when I got pulled over in Virginia doing well over 90 in a 70, the cop was really nice and only wrote that i was going 10 miles over the limit so i wouldn't get a felonious speeding ticket charge (and he was white). And a whole mess of friends from AA are either current cops or retired cops and some of them helped me out when I was getting scammed by some guy who backed up into me and tried to get me to pay for his "damages". All of them are white. 

Whenever I see stories on TV about a cop shooting a black person I always feel bad for the cop first and normally look at the evidence to see why the cop did it. Usually I don't see the shooting to be racially motivated at all, and rarely do I think they did anything wrong. 

Example: the Staten Island Guy, he resisted arrest (I know this wasn't a shooting) 

The guy in baton rouge resisted arrest, and was reported to have been brandishing a gun so it seems sensible for the cops to use deadly force in that instance. 

I'm not saying that their aren't any racist cops. But I just don't understand how people automatically assume that cops are racist and that a cop isn't just a shitty cop. 

For example, the cop who shot the autistic mans helper in Miami, I assume he's a shitty cop but not racist. But even white friends of mine automatically assume it was racially motivated. 

I feel like I must be missing something. So can you change my view?

If the rule is no dyed hair, then no dyed hair.

<TEXT> A good friend of mine was banned from wearing his tench coat because of it. Meanwhile it was a very expensive trenchcoat his father brought for him.

His parents, rightfully so, told the school to fuck off. 

Meanwhile, the school told me that cuz I made some shit joke "imma buy a tench coat cuz they come with guns" or some shit. That I either had to get therapy with their school doctor or be suspended til I did. I was suspended until I did. Tho while my parents were battling it out the school had to pay for homeschooling by private tutors and eventually had to let me back cuz they were wrong.  </TEXT>

It was raining, and I was a teenager so I didn't give a fuck about rain. Get there, take off my pans, my legs are blue as fuck. It was very awkward. Also i chafed the shit out of my legs on the walk back to school. And had to wear my gym pants the rest of the day. Which was stupid cuz everyone knows, no sweats during regular school.  </TEXT>

"I need a bottle of wine a day to get thru summer vacation" or "this blizzard is  a 3 bottle blizzard" "can't wait til the kids go to bed so I can drink a box of wine." Or "I'm not an alcoholic, I'm a drunk!" 

I'm always like bitch, I was downing 1/2 liters of jd before noon, and no one knew because I'm not drinking for attention.  

Like they think being constantly  drunk and on fb is cute. Needless to say I don't hang out with them much. Not cuz I can't be around drunks. But because I can't be around people who talk about drinking so much.  </TEXT>

Meanwhile, I planned to have my kid, had him early at like 24, took prenatal vitamins from pre conception, all thru, didn't eat canned food, exercised, water, no caffeine, no drugs, no alcohol, no smoking, no cold cuts, no soft cheeses, folic acid up the ass. My son has autism. Which is probably genetic. But still it just seems horribly unfair. </TEXT>

No.  I don't believe so. and not in the past 2 days anyways. The last water I drove thru that even made a splash was on Wednesday. 

I don't think it got higher than maybe a few centimeters if that. but i don't know what kind of damage that might do. it's just like really wet floor mats and  the flooring is wet and stinky as hell. 

My deductable is 500$ if that makes any difference. I mean if the damage is gonna be $500 and i have to pay 500 before insurance pays anything then i'm not going to report it.  </TEXT>

Basically, the entire back passanger side is soaking wet, like more than a spilled soda, and there was flooding in the area on Saturday / Sunday night/morning. 

It might just be that it's musty and wet inside but it might be big problems. Should i make a claim to my insurance? Or should i just dry it out.

<TEXT> I should be an expert and well adjusted as my son was diagnosed with autism at 15 months. And has been in programs ever since.

But idk, it seems as though as he gets older and misses more milestones I seem to hate autism and resent having him more and more. 

I love him but at the same time I regret ever having a kid. 

Even when I was pregnant, I knew it was possible to have a kid with a disability. When he was diagnosed I didn't have a problem. But it's seems as every day that I still have to change a diaper (he's 8 ) now or clean poop up off the floor, or deal with getting kicked just to brush teeth. Or see his 3 year old cousins do more and talk more than him. I just hate being a mom more and more. 

If he had autism and he spoke maybe it would be easier. Or at least could understand the concept of pooping in a toilet. But he can't. 

And I feel so alone, and monstrous for feeling like this. But this isn't the life I wanted. I can't live my dreams because for some reason the universe decided to screw me. 

I see other mom friends who go on the educational trips I enjoy or go camping which I'd like. And I can't do those things. He hates even sitting on the slide, how am I gonna get him to sleep in a tent. 

It's just really shitty. I never feel like I can go to friends houses. Mainly because he will tear it up. He doesn't respect people's things. If they have a smart TV he'll try to take it over. Just general chaos ensues. I go sometimes but especially if he strips we usually aren't invited back. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Had a post and /u/bertweaze asked if i'd 1, lower my rate and then wanted a test article. I said I'd do a test article for the full rate of $15. 

He sends me the information over PM.

I tell him the work won't be done until Tuesday June 28th. This is because in addition to other things, I was planning on going somewhere for my birthday. And I don't work weekends. So he contacts me on the 24th of June and I tell him then the work won't be done until the 28th. 

On the morning of the 28th I get a PM telling me, that he didn't want that work. I was mid way thru finishing the writing. The research is done, the pictures had been picked out. All I have to do is finish the article and edit it. 

So he says he doesn't want the work. He wants some amazon descriptions done instead. So I say fine. I can do that. A week passes. no information. Then he says, hey, that project got scrapped, but hold onto the money cuz I've got something else going on.

Then I get a dispute in Paypal about how I didn't deliver the work. 

How can I deliver work for someone that changes their mind over and over again. And I've already done a bunch of the work and yet he keeps wanting me to restart. 


Don't do any work for him, he'll just jerk you around.

<TEXT>  Is it better to have a Zero Copay Insurance with a Middling out of pocket maximum. And you regularly go to to doctor. Or a Low (read 10 - 40$) copay with a higher Out of pocket max.

The low copay you only pay like 5 - 30 for scripts
but I'd probably reach the out of pocket max on the zero copay in 2 or 3 months and not have to pay anything else at all afterwards.

I did want to get Weight Loss surgery. I have mental health problems and take like 3 scripts for that and I may have diabetes so there's all the medical tests and stuff that includes. 

Any advice would be appreciated. The facts are below. None of them include dental but they do include vision but only up to a point. 

**Low Copay Facts**

* After ACA Voucher $123
* Deductible - 1,000 ($500 / person)
* Out-Of Pocket Max - $4,000
* Primary Care - $5 copay 
* Specialist - $45 copay
* Generic Drugs - $5
* Brand - $30
* Diagnostic Tests - 20% after deductible
* Weight Loss Surgery - 50% after deductible 

**No Copay Facts**

* After ACA Voucher $161
* Deductible - $2200 ($1100 / person)
* Out-Of Pocket Max - $2,200
* Primary Care - $0 after Deductable 
* Specialist - $0 after Deductable
* Generic Drugs - 0 after deductable
* Brand - $0 after deductable
* Diagnostic Tests - 0 after deductible
* Weight loss surgery - no charge after deductible.

I hate my birthday. It is always like the worst day ever.

Last year, I tried to like Make my day happy and forcemyself to be happy. And

Every time my shit birthday comes around I consider how awesome it would have been if, my dad had worn a condom. Or my mom had had an abortion.

I really do wish that my life was over.

I'm not much of a ray of sunshine the other 364 days of the year.

I really am biding my time til I get squashed by that big foot. Or whatever.

<TITLE> Ral-Dur-Chapel Area Meetup </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay so I was thinking that [AMF Pleasant Valley](https://www.amf.com/location/amf-pleasant-valley-lanes/#0AeQ6) would be best. It seems situated right in the middle so to speak. 

I figure a sunday evening. Either 7pm or 8pm would be best. 

Maybe do 2 games, some pizza and sodas. 


So here are some choices for dates:

* July 10
* July 17
* July 24
* July 31

I suppose vote in the comments. 

I figure sunday is good cuz I believe it's 3$ shoes and games. so that would save everyone money. 

If it works out maybe we can do something else in August. 

I'd say not a movie cuz that's not really as social as it seems. Maybe we all hang out at orange leaf and pour pinapple juice over pinapple frozen yogurt and pretend we're at disney world. lol

I'll start 4 different comment threads for the dates, vote them up and i suppose comment.  </TEXT>

Their kids will make them breakfast in bed, or do this thing or that, because they wanted to. And I'm working with none of that. Tho, I managed to get my son to paint a mug for his dad. But he doesn't know what day it is. And if he does he doesn't care or doesn't show it.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Found a client on craigslist. So, I'm supposed to edit his book for narrative quality and grammar, but the focus is on making it sound good.

Meanwhile, I've sent him 3 emails that stated that I require a deposit. I usually ask for 50% upfront and then the remainder at the end. 

However, since he's local, I told him to give me 25% up front and then pay the rest upon delivery. 

I've sent him 3 emails to this effect
the first 2 he said he didn't get and then later "found" in his junk email folder. 

He hasnt responded to the last email tho, i only sent it yesterday.

So I have a few questions:

Do you charge a deposit? If so, how much (percent wise)?

Should I just tell him find someone else, because he seems shady? Or give him a chance? He says he has 2 other books that need editing and that could net me a few thousand dollars. IF he pays.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My family moved to NC a few months ago and my husband works but he was supposed to get a raise but they haven't given it to him yet and I haven't been able to find a work. We make just enough to not qualify for foodstamps but with all the bills we are really strapped for cash. 

I've been trying to spend less than 50 bucks a week for food because with Rent, Electricity, Insurance and everythign like we're at our max money. But my son is super picky and it's really hard to just only eat rice and beans and things like that. 

I have been trying to get some permanent jobs but I've submitted at least 5 applications *a day to jobs of all type since we moved here and registered at 3 different temp agencies but still nothing. I've been told it's because I was a stay at home mom for so long. I couldn't even get hired by Sheetz (a gas station convenience store near me). In the mean time I've been catching freelance jobs on craigslist, reddit and doing mturk and things like that. Those are good but I only have like $5 in mturk. I did catch a job on craigslist last week tho. 

However, the client owes me some money but she's being really flighty and not answering emails. I was supposed to get that money by today but I haven't. 

I'm stuck cuz I need to buy milk and a few other things but I don't have any money. 

Amazon now delivers to my area. And i have a car and could go to any of the supermarkets near by which are Food Lion, Kroger and Harris Teeter. And there's a walmart and target. From what I can gather only  Walmart and Target do e-gift cards. 

I can pay back as soon as I get paid, via paypal, if that is a necessity. 

Thanks in advance.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My husband is a postal carrier, and he doesn't love it. He's a CCA so they're paid pretty badly and the management are kind of dicks. But all that aside. He complains that he doesn't have any skills. 

Since a bunch of my friends are all in unions, plumbers, electricians, steamfitters, bricklayers. I suggested maybe he become an apprentice. 

But for all you electricians (especially the union guys) would you rather be an electrician or anything else?

He was considering taking some night and online classes to get a computer science degree. But I think that being an electrician is a better route. because I figure even if it turns out he hates it, he can always become an electrical engineer. Or am I wrong about that? 

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<TITLE> This is the last Week on Earth for A Family Friend </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-11 15:57:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> He's like my husbands Uncle by marriage. 

When I first met my husband, he was already a family joke. He was the guy that would promise to Jesus, his wife, his family, that he was all done with drinking. 

And he would be. 

For a month. 


And then he'd be off again, chasing the drink. I couldn't stand being around him (I don't think anyone really could). 

He always smelled of cheap vodka. A sickly smell, that always preceded him before he entered a room. Often before he told tales of how he was still very much sober, through the hard work of Jesus. 

And people went with it, even though he was full of bullshit and cheap vodka. Because what are you to do. Call him on it, and he gets mad and storms of on a week long bender? 

Or say nothing, and he secretly drinks him self stupid in his basement. 

He was a terrible man. He beat his wife, or so my mother in law tells me. Of course, he wife stood by him, like a good christian woman. Hoping that he'd become the decent, intelligent, kind man that he was when he wasn't drinking again. 

And why did he beat her? Because she was a teetotaler. She didn't drink. It was against her religion. And she was devout. I'm not a Pentecostal. I've traveled that journey once, it's not my thing. But her sincerity and dedication to her lord was, IS,  indisputable. She stayed with him because the bible said that divorce is a sin. And she prayed for him constantly to give up that bottle. And Will, beat her for it. He beat her for going to church. He beat her for not drinking. And be beat her because he's a son of a bitch. 

I hardly see the attraction, but I've been assured that before alcohol made him completely disgusting and unemployable that he was a highly skilled and apparently attractive man. 

He's not anymore. Alcohol took that away from him. 

And now he lay barely clinging on, withering away, frail, skinny, and pale at home, dying. 

Why?

Oh, an alcoholic knows why. 

Because, how was he supposed to celebrate when things went well?
How was he supposed to end a hard day after work?
How was he supposed to handle the stresses of the world?
How could he cope with all these bills he had?
What was he to do when everything was all messed up?
What was he supposed to do with all the free time?
What kind of person can't enjoy just one little drink?
How can he deal with the pain from the destruction of his liver? 
How could he handle the bad news that he was going to die?

Alcohol answered all those questions and more.  
Alcohol solved all his problems, if you consider death a solution. 

And I suppose it is.

At least for his wife, I hope he death brings her some peace. That he finally put down that bottle. 

As for me, I don't morn someone like that. Alcohol turned them into a beast. I only pray that it doesn't do the same to me as well.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I have an Associates degree in Accounting, a Bachelors in English. I've worked at places like Google and big name companies in NY.

I haven't had a steady office job since 2012. 
I did do a lot of freelance writing for the past 3 years. It ramped up until i was making about 12-15K a year. which isn't bad for a part-time esque job. 

I've read a few articles that say to volunteer for a bit to get "current work". 

I had tried a go at being a writer. And despite the adage that if you love doing something that you should make it your day job. I disagree. I did not like making something that was fun, into work. I prefer doing work like bookkeeping and accounting, for work. (I'm actually quite adept at it). And keeping my writing for writing. 

I just want a little 15 - 25 hour part time job. I just want to pay for my car and maybe buy stuff around the house. 

But basically every place I look for work complains that I haven't worked in 4 years as their reason for not hiring me. This includes places like Target and Starbucks and things like that. 

Any advice would be great. 

I'm sure this would help basically anyone else whos taken a few years off of working. 

I have considered going back to get my masters in accounting so I can get my CPA. But that's at least a year from now till I even apply. So in the meantime, i'd like to work.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, I'm going to relapse. It's something that I can see coming at me a mile away. 

We moved, from shot ass NYC, to North Carolina. But I'm bored and lonely. Bored and lonely were the 2 main factors to me picking up a drink as a solution in the first place. 

Not to mention that there's been a major hiccup with the apartment that we were supposed to get so we'll be in a hotel basically for a month.

Also, lets pile on some guilt, because I was so certain that just the prospect of moving would make everything magically better. Of course, as they always say in meetings: "Wherever you go, there you are."

Plus, as sure as I was of it. I thought, Oh, I won't miss my quasi-friends from AA. But I do.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was thinking today, upon some journeys that I'm going to be having in the next few weeks. (Moving to North Carolina from NYC) and I'm a little scared and nervous. 

What if it isn't the bright new start my family needs. What if nothing works out. What if the apartment falls thru and we end up living in a hotel or something stupid. What if nothing works out.

And then I thought, you know what would take the edge off. A drink.

But I can't just have one. I can't just get blotto tonight once and not want to do it all over again tomorrow and the next day and the next day and the next day until I've lost everyone and everything. 

Tho considering how down i am about my life trajectory in general, i don't think i'd care much right now. But I'm sure I'd care in 10 years. Or maybe 20. Or maybe when I'm sitting in a hospital bed finding out I've done something irreparable to myself, like drank my liver away. Or maybe watching TV to see my son has invented some big thing despite all the odds, and completely without me. That will be when I regret it. 

But right now I'm just really annoyed that I can't just have one. Because I know where it goes. And I'm just not prepared to make that gamble yet.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I feel, and am pretty sure that it's a fact that I'm a failure.

I applied for a coding bootcamp. Because of a number of reasons, but mainly because I wanted someone else to tell me that I'm good enough and smart enough. 

Apparently, I'm neither. I didn't get in. 

Being as I completely screwed my career, I need an extra something to get me back into the proper work force. 

The freelance writing thing isn't going great. Work has been utterly dead since September. 

My husband goes back to work in a few days, he'd been out due to a workplace injury. And now I feel very alone and useless. 

I started drinking to excess because I hated being a Housewife. I felt like there had to be more to me than cooking and cleaning and bullshit like that. But apparently I'm wrong. 

I've failed at life. I'm starting to come to the realization that I'm just not supposed to be around anymore. 

Anyway, I'm not writing this to be like ah , save me. But to tell the person who hasn't fucked their entire life up yet. To not fuck up your entire life up. And stop drinking before you become a failure like me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We've been looking for programming bootcamps like the ones they have for web developers but he's really interested in things like C++, Java and writing software.

Should he find a bootcamp? or go the route of getting an additional degree in computer science? 

Not so much in terms of what will get you a job, but what will get his knowledge of computing and software creation to it's highest point. 

**edit**

He has an AA in Criminal Justice and a BA in PoliSci and Philosophy

He knows ruby and some HTML/CSS but he really isn't thrilled with web programming. he had learned a little bit of python in the past. And at one point was quite adept at Visual Basic. 

and he's in his mid to late 30's.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have been really tired lately, think I'll sleep an appropriate time at night but still sleep all day like 10 am to 2 pm. 

And over the past few days I've noticed that my feet were a little swollen. They're like really fucking swollen now. My husband broke his ankle a few months back and my foot looks like it did the 2nd day. Like maybe 2x the size. 

That swelling has recently moved up to the ankles and then today my whole lower leg / calf area is swelling.

I know I should definitely see a doctor. 

What I want to know is 1, could it possibly be Congestive heart failure?

2, can I wait the 2 or 3 days it'll take for me to get a doctor's appointment, should I go to a urgent care center tomorrow morning, or should I get my bass to the hospital ASAP? 

Either way I'm going to see a professional, just want to know what level of WTF, I'm dealing with.

I'm 32, Female, 5ft 5, 300lbs, black/native American.

I've been fatigued for about a month. The ankle thing has been going on for a week and spreading. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm trying to gather up the fee / deposit for by coding bootcamp. So that I can offer you cut-rate webdesign services at a later date.

So make an investment in me by hiring me for all your online based needs. 


**Writing**

I have a degree in English Language Arts from a very awesome school in NYC. I'm mildly funny (and funny looking) so if you need some comedy stylings I can make that happen. However, I find that my strongest suit is with technical documents, and web copy. 

Rates are competitive. For example, I'm willing to do a webpage for you (including lite CSS/HTML5 coding) for 150. without any coding it would be less. Contact me for more information. 

**Bookkeeping and Data Entry**

I worked for a number of years as a Junior Accountant for the corporate office of a very well known Gym. With all this experience under my belt, I can help you budget, perform data entry, and other financial and clerical type work. 

**Stock Photos**

I can provide you with a pack of 10 stock photos for $20. They are completely able to be used online without any fear.

**Random Drawing**

Since sometimes people just like to spend money on random stuff. I'm willing to draw you anything for $5 via paypal. Reminder, my drawing skills are not great. I can draw something really awesome but that takes hours of dedication, that would cost way more than $5. For $5 you get a drawing that took me about 15-20 minutes to create. 

I can provide an example picture if anyone would like. 

Thanks in advance!

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I applied to a coding bootcamp and I'm supposed to do a test before the interview. 

They say I can use whatever code I want but they *prefer* that I use ruby.

When they say prefer, Is that like the suggested personal essay in college applications? You know, where it's optional, but your best bet is to do it. 

Or is it like, use ruby cuz it makes it easier for them, but if your better at python, it might be better to do it in python. 


Another question: Has anyone ever been to coding bootcamp? How was it? did you like it? and depending on the route you went, would you have preferred to go a different way?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> An Old Friend of Mine Died on the 11th </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-14 23:28:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Today, I found out that an old friend of mine died November 11, 2015. 

She died of an OD. Either pills or Heroin. cuz that's the shit that people are heavily into around here. 

I had seen her posts on FB in the past few weeks and months. She'd been doing good. She stopped partying, was helping out with an animal rescue, was doing more shit with family and friends. Really reaching out and being part of her community. All those things that you are taught to do in recovery. 

Meanwhile I'm 600+ days into sobriety. Just kinda floating thru, resting on my laurels. Just getting shit done. Not making meetings, not getting involved, not reaching out to the next addict. Constantly considering, why I even needed to quit in the first place. Trying to rationalize a beer, or a pill, or something. 

And I don't know how it happened. Maybe she just said, One more time can't hurt. but it did.

Maybe she just said, No one cares about me, but they do, they really fucking do.

Maybe she just realized she couldn't go without a drink or a drug for the rest of her life. But she didn't need to go forever, just one more day, and try again the next. 

But that's not even the worse part. 

The worst part was going into the event page on FB for her memorial. And reading a list of none other than 34 different people, many of them younger than me. All of which had died from drugs this year. Some of them I didn't know, but SHE KNEW EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. She had organized this massive memorial for all the people she had seen killed by this disease. Only to become another name on it's list. 

Don't pick up today. 

I'm 32 years old and the only person I knew who has more dead friends than me was my Grandfather and he died in June at the age of 88. 

So this post is for my buddy Emily, and all the other people who have gone too damn soon cuz of this disease.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, 

Ever since my husband hurt himself on the job things have not been going well for me and my family. He was a Package Deliverer and made a very good income, but his injury has stopped him from working. We get workers comp, but you have to fill out these claim forms and then they tend to sit on them for an annoyingly long time. The most recent one we put in at the beginning of October has just been marked as received and we faxed it directly to them on October 2nd. During the time my husband has been injured, he has been taking online classes in computer programming. 

Recently, another vehicle came into my lane and as such I swerved to get out of the way which resulted in our car getting totaled. 

That being said we are due a decent sum by mid november. but in general the money that workers comp gives is 75% of what he would make in 40 hours, normally as a package deliverer he made 50 - 60 hours a week. so it really is a huge shift in income for us. 

I've been doing all I can to come up with additional ways to make money. I sometimes get work on the various reddit freelance pages, I had a decent long term writing job for one of those FB annoying quiz companies (but that ended in August), I did the elance thing, I signed up at all the temp agencies in my area, I've been applying to full and part-time work daily, and we've gotten some help from our church, families, people on this sub, and the like. 

I do have a job interview for a company in my area on Monday, I'm hoping i get that but it'll be at least 2 weeks before I see any money. 

I have a borrow request on r/borrow - for some money to pay my auto insurance (if you can help with that, i would be much obliged)

However, that not withstanding i basically have $15 for food for my family for the next 13 days. I also have enough bing search credits for a 10$ burger king gift card, and there is 1 food bank near me that I can get to easily but that's open on tuesday. 

So, how can you help?

The stores closest to me are: CVS, Walgreens, Shoprite, Dollar Tree, Stop   Shop, and a few local grocers

I can easily set up an order on any of these supermarkets websites that they'll deliver or let me pick up for a fee, if you're inclined to do that

You could buy my family a pizza or a gift card for dominos or papa johns

You could loan me some money on r/borrow

I suppose you can buy me stuff on amazon (but what i really need are things like chicken nuggets, flour, eggs and milk, butter, cereal and stuff like that.) basically mostly prime pantry stuff

alternatively,

I do have some things I can offer in exchange for other things:

obviously not the most financially sensible choice - I can buy you a victoria's secret egiftcard for 10% more than you help me out with. (basically it's the only credit card that we haven't fully tapped before asking for help)

I paid for a subscription to an online stock photo site for my writing jobs a while ago, and if you happen to need a bunch of stock photos I can download an agreed upon amount of photos to you in exchange for something (unless that's like illegal or something I don't really know)

I do have a degree in English and Bookkeeping. So should you need any work done that involves sums or writing, I could do that in exchange. 

So that's basically the gist. 

Thanks in advance

And I totally plan to do some pay it forward type stuff as in this time of struggle, I've been doing some reach out to others in my community where i can, donating old clothing and the like. And I plan on going on a missionary trip sometime next year, to help orphans in Asia.

<TEXT> I don't even want to drink. Like I'm not thirsty or hard up for a drink or a drug. 

Things aren't working out very well for me or my family right now. Car is totaled, might be able to get maybe 75$ from the junk yard for it. 

And I've got maybe 13 bucks to buy food for my family til  I get some kind of cash influx. somehow. 

Nothing is working out. 

I don't even want to drink, couldn't afford to get one, and wouldn't even care for one. 

but I kinda feel like, with life sucking as much as it does right now, that It would be a good idea to just say screw it and drink it up. Like you know, at least, if i were drinking or using I'd have some excuse for my life not going well. 

Idk what the purpose of this is, but i suppose, the purpose is to just ge tit out there.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Things aren't working out terribly well for me and my family lately
we're behind on rent, money is extremely tight, so tight we're gonna end up going to a food bank, and because of some other driver my car is messed up and I don't have the money to fix it, because my car is broken I can't go to church (it's really far) and I don't have any money for public transportation. 

It's really really really stressful. 

I could really use some prayers for either me to get some work, or for something miraculous to happen.

<TEXT> Today, I do a magic trick and will turn 569 days into zero. 
this is likely the way wrong place for this. 

Or maybe somehow, someones words will help me see another way (I hope)

in the last 30 days the following things have happened:

I got into an accident (and due to a payment snafu didn't have auto insurance at the time) 
I got a charged in a separate incident with reckless driving (going 84 in a 70mph)
I just (as in 2 hours ago) got into another accident totaling my car. 
I'm like behind on rent
I'm at my edge
I can't do this anymore

So, if I feel like death or drinking is the only answer, shouldn't I go with the least permanent one? At least that's my theory. 

Idk maybe i'm wrong. maybe I'm wrong. 

I'm gonna use the phone a friend option but if things don't start lookign brighter fast I'm just completely done.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Should I Move to Raleigh, NC; Omaha, NE, or stay in NYC </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-08-12 06:59:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Trying to figure out if I should move my family of three or stay where we are?

The Facts:

We live in a 1br apartment in NYC, it's all we can afford at the high rate of rent (leading to 3 people in 1 small apartment)

We're looking to move into an apartment thats in the 500 to 1000 range for a 2br. Or we might just stay where we are until later. 

I'm a freelance writer; my husband is a mailman (tho he's quitting because he keeps getting hurt on the job)

Our son has autism (NonVerbal)

The Options:

Stay in NYC, be kinda poorish, but our church is here, and family is here. Unemployment rate is 6.1. Have no clue what we'll do for work haven't been able to get traditional employment other than little crap jobs and freelance work for the past few years. Also the schools kinda suck. 

Go to Raleigh, NC, change churches, husband wants to become an Electricians Apprentice in the Union there, I think I can get a book keeping job easily, Unemployment rate is 4.0, And they have a pretty decent autism education at the public schools

Go to Omaha, NE, change churches, husband isn't sure what he'll do out there, I am sure I can get some kinda work, Unemployment is 2.7. There is a lot of gang violence over there tho lots of shootings. There is a pretty decent Religious Autism School there but it's private so I'd have to pay something. 


So those are the choices. 

What do you think?

The husband wants to go to Raleigh, because he has a pretty decent plan to get work, and the place is nice. 

I want to go to Omaha, entirely based upon the fact that with a 2.7 unemployment rate we have to be able to get some kinda work. 

Our familes want us to stay put.

Other random facts, 

We're a mixed race couple

I have a BA in English and an AA in Accounting

He has a BA in PoliSci and an AA in Criminal Justice </TEXT>

Part of this stems from the fact that I'm a ghostwriter and I was supposed to finish a book by July 7th, as we all see it's August 8th. 

I'm afraid i'm gonna get sued. I'm not doing any work. I sit around and sleep all day. 

I need to focus and get some work done. I keep thinking that if I get really high or drunk that I'll be able to pour words from my fingers into this book and finally finish it. 

But I've thus far resisted. but the more behind I am, the more I want to take something. 

I don't even know if I want like actual advice. I kinda am hoping for someone to say, "Go ahead subject4454 you know you need them pills / booze to do your work" 

but I know that it is totally a bad idea, shit a friend from the rooms just died from a pills overdose. 

but fuck if i don't want to pick up. If i can't get this book done soon. I know I will.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello!

Hi, I'm planning on moving to Raleigh around the 20th of September.

I've worked as: 

* a content researcher
* a treasury management bookkeeper
* a freelance writer (I even ghostwrote a book)
* a quiz writer
* an retail operations supervisor

I know the following software and programming languages: 

* Microsoft Office (Excel, Word, Access, Outlook, Powerpoint and OneNote)
* Quick books (all iterations) 
* Oracle financial management platforms
* Xero
* Content Management Systems
* HTML
* Python 2.X

I am educated. I have an AA degree in Accounting and Office Management. I also completed (but haven't officially graduated) a BA in English Language Arts (focusing on English Linguistics). 

I pick up new software and programing languages very quickly. I am a hard worker and take pride in my work. 

I can come down for an interview with a 24 hour notice. 

PM me for my Resume and portfolio of writing samples. I am willing to do a skype interview or telephone interview as well.

<TITLE> Need Money for Milk and Stuff for dinner </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-08-02 21:34:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> If I had anyone else to ask, I'd totally do it. 

I'm a very generous person and I really don't like asking for things. 

My husband has been out of work due to his broken ankle and workers comp is being really slow to come thru. 

I really just need like a 10$ target giftcard to help me buy a gallon of milk, and something for dinner. I went to a food pantry today but they didn't have milk and gave me stuff that my autistic son won't eat. 

For myself, I've got no problem eating oatmeal for dinner. but he really won't eat that. 

I am normally very very generous. Just in early July I donated like 300 dollars  of food and school supplies. 

Basically what happened was, he was supposed to get a check last friday for a couple thousand dollars.  (its back pay that he is owed since february) 

They still haven't processed the check. It's supposed to be processed by this coming friday the 7th. but idk what the hell is going on. 

I had a freelance job, but that ended and the final paycheck for that doesn't come until friday. 

I've been trying to get other part time gigs on /r/forhire but it hasn't worked out for me yet. And to be honest, I don't think it would do much good for me today anyways. 

All this is to say, I need at least $10 to buy a gallon of milk and some meat for my son (obvs I'm probably going to have some of the milk and meat.) if you can really spare an extra $5 or 10 so i can buy him some cereal and lunch stuff for school tomorrow, that would be great. 

either way, Thank you for any thoughts or prayers that you can put in to my family. 

I will do some kind of work for the money if necessary and I can definitely pay the money back by friday. Or at the very least I will pay it forward and give someone else a gift card to their local store next friday if need be. 

thanks. 

Also I will totally post a picture of the reciept and food that I brought for proof, if need be. heck, i'll even give you my home number so you can talk to me personally if you need to.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been doing something a little weird lately and I'm not sure if it is good practice. 

I've been offering clients a 10 to 15% discount if they sign a contract with me that promises that they will hire me for another job that bills at least 75% of what the cost of this job was, within the next 3 to 6 months. Obviously, the contract gives them an out which is slightly more than the discount I've given them should they say yes and then later decide to back out. 

Is this a good practice. I'm really trying to do things that give the client the belief that they are getting a discount but actually results in more billable time for me. So i have work that I can count on in the future. Sure, the whole if they decide to be scumbags and not follow thru on the second job thing is an issue and I'm sure that it would probably be rather annoying for me to file a lawsuit to collect on something like that I gave them a $100 dollar discount for promising to work with me in the future but they didn't and as such they owe me either the kill fee of $150 or the 750 for the second job that they promised. But you know i figure if someone signs a contract they'll  be more apt to follow thru and that will lend me more jobs in the future. Also I promise up to 3 revisions with any of my work tho If they need more I usually just do them for free unless they decide to completely change the concept. 

anyway what do you think? 

Also how do you get more work from a client (other than the whole doing the best damn job thing, which I always try to do anyway). </TEXT>

But i haven't had any luck so far. 

I'm going to talk to my doctor about maybe trying metaformin but i wanted to know what everyones experience was with it. Did you lose weight? how long did it take to get preggers? any sideeffects i should be worried about. and should i try something else first?

I've tried "lots of banging",
temping and all that,
ovulation kits, (which is hard as shit when you don't get a period)
and for weight loss i've had a nutritionist and a trainer since January i've not lost much weight. 

so experiences please! Thanks

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, yesterday someone contacts me online asking if I'd help them with a cookbook. I say sure, a cookbook should be easy work (should be). After locking down some of the details, I guess I should ask what they're looking to pay first, I write up my initial proposal for the work (they want pictures, ePub formatting and obviously writing).

Proposal Rejected. Why? Too Expensive, way out of budget.

So, I suggest, a decent deal, I'll throw in the pictures for free, for actual credit for the photography in the book, and some free advertising on their part for my services. Mind, I'm still ghostwriting this thing and doing all the research, but I figure I have to make the dishes anyway so might as well put my DSLR to good use and take some photos for free advertising.

Proposal Rejected. Why? Still too expensive, way out of budget.

Fed up, I finally ask "what is the budget?"

How much did they expect to spend for 50 desert recipes, the research to create those recipes, and 50+ photographs?

150.00 USD

I wished them good luck with finding someone willing to do all that work for less than a penny per word. Not to mention photos.

The sad part is, they'll find someone to do it probably. The writing will be atrocious, the recipes all a work of fiction (completely untested), and probably filled with a bunch of terribly composed photos taken on someone's iPhone (i hope). And someone will be duped into buying it on Amazon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Don't do it!**

I'm not going to drink today and I got hung up on by my aunt when I called to ask where my grandfathers funeral would be. It's safe to say my entire family hates me. And not cuz of anything I did while drinking. I even tried to do a ninth step with them and that went over about as well as trying to apologize to your cats butt. 

Additionally, the last conversation that I had with my grandfather went essentially like this :

Me: I want to apologize for being a jerk and yelling at you, and making life difficult when I was a teenager, it was just that so-and-so abused me and I couldn't deal with it. 

Him: I don't believe that ever happened cuz you waited too long to say anything about it. 

Me: Why would I make something like that up? (Ithink I also said whatevers about that anyways that I'm just trying to apologize for my part in everything which is what you're supposed to do with the 9th step and then I said something about how I just always felt like no one loved me)

Him: You were a difficult child and hard to love. 

Me: Well, I did my part *hangs up phone*

So, not only do I have a terrible memory of the deceased. My last convo with him went terribly. And I'm pretty sure no one in my family wants me to come to his funeral (but also i'll look like an asshole if I don't go)

But nevertheless, I didn't drink today, don't plan on drinking today. And I don't plan on drinking tomorrow. 

**tl;dr: If I can go thru this terribly unbelieveably wtf I need a drink type shit, without drinking, so can you** </TEXT>

<TITLE> Should I go to my grandfathers funeral? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-29 19:41:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **tl;dr: had a fight with man who raised me, became estranged, tried to reconcile but it ended badly, and he died, should I attend the funeral**

I've posted about this in /r/offmychest that I'm not really mourning my grandfathers passing. Maybe the permanency hasn't hit me yet or maybe I just don't care, I don't really know. The most I'm upset about is that he died on my birthday. 

Some back information: I was orphaned as a child and at first my aunt had taken me in but there was some abuse and she blamed me so my grandparents ended up taking me in from the age of about 9 or 10. 

Life existed. things happened. I grew up. I'm not saying I was the model teenager. I had a minor drug problem which is probably related to my PTSD from the abuse, but whatevers. 

Anyway, my grandparents and I had a huge fight because when hurricane sandy destroyed my neighborhood (my house was fine we just had no power, no food, and no heat), I asked if myself, my husband, and autistic son could come over for a few  hours so we could have a place with wifi, lighting, and heat and water so we could figure out what to do next. They said flat out no. 

On fb I said, i felt like no one cared about me because who tells someone something like that. They were pissed, we stopped talking since then. 

about a year ago, I tried to make my peace with them and apologized for any hurt feeling that i might have caused. Then he tells me that they've always done stuff for me and that I acted stupidly and they've never done anything to hurt me and essentially that I was being a massive jerk for telling people on fb that they wouldn't give me shelter during the hurricane. So I mentioned how no one ever did anything legally about the guy that abused me and then he said that I took too long to tell anyone and that they think i had made it up. The last thing he said to me before hanging up was that, "I was a difficult child, and hard to love" 

Anyway, while I care that the man is dead. I think that one since most of my family hates me because of the fight and since I'm not particularly sad that I shouldn't go. But worry that if I don't go that will make me look like an asshole and they'll hate me more further reducing the chance for me to ever reconcile with anyone in my family.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I have managed to get a few decent jobs out of elance, but i'm kinda getting tired of having to explain my value to people who want things for way less than it's worth. 

After some lengthy negotiations with someone about Questions for a Language and Grammar learning application or software, they then said my prices were too high and they could get questions for cheaper. They got me down to $5 dollars per question, which I thought was a great price considering that I was including the passages that that the questions would refer to. 

All this is to say, where do you guys find more better paying jobs so that you don't have to deal with this kind of thing.  </TEXT>

My grand father died, on my birthday, and I'm not sad about his death at all. I feel no grief about it and honestly am only kinda pretending that I'm sad so i don't seem like a heartless person. I'm more pissed that he couldn't wait to die til the next day. 

The last thing that he said to me about a year ago was "You were a difficult child, and were hard to love"

I've posted on facebook about how sad i am and when talking to family members (who all kinda dislike me I'm the black sheep) I try and pretend that I'm genuinely concerned but I really am more concerned about getting work done. 

*edit* it's important to note that this is the guy that raised me from the age of 7 </TEXT>

I'm basically trying to figure out why God is allowing this to happen. I don't know what I did wrong to make us go thru such a rough time. It sucks being all poor and going to foodbanks and stuff. We were supposed to get paid this week but there was some hiccup with the payment (again) and inspite of my reservations i made a purchase of a few comics to relieve some stress. But now i totally regret having done so because he's not going to get paid until the 20th (hopefully)

I know Matthew 6:26 says "Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?" 

But you know it is still stressful as all get out. Basically just looking for some silverlining or maybe just venting. Idk prayers would be appreciated.  </TEXT>

The main character is a woman who lives in Staten Island New York and likes to drink, who goes around with a coyote. 

I don't really have a good idea about what I want to happen but I know the overwhelming goal of the woman is to get to Quito, Ecuador because she figures it'll be warm there. 

There aren't a lot of people around because many left when it became winter and stayed winter, and it's always darkish, never really bright outside. 

Does this sound like a good story idea. 

And also is anyone interested in collaborating with me on this, i'm not an artist by a long shot.  </TEXT>

I can use the money for my crippling comic book addiction (and bills). 

Here are some facts:
1. My husband is on workers comp right now (and they haven't started paying yet)
2. My husbands normal job is as a postal worker
3. We live in rent controlled apartment where our rent is like 1/4 of his pay) 
4. We don't pay for utilities and stuff
5. Our other bills are like 120 for insurance, 220 for cell service, 200 for internet and cable, and food is approximately like 300 a month. 
6. I don't have to work, but I'd like to have something to do with my time all day
7. I also do their twitter feed. 

so make my choice for me Keep the shitty freelance job to keep myself in the market/ in play or quit it which will probably make it a bit harder for me to find freelance work.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just been sad about my life lately, wanna drink. Mainly sad because my parental units pretend like i never existed and so does the other members of my birth family. Plus today I saw an old friend and said hello to them and they pretended that I don't exist.

Why do people keep treating me as tho i'm not a human, and i'm not real. 

If I don't exist then maybe it will be best for me to drink, nonexistant people don't reall matter anyways so why even try to be a better person.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> F/31 NYC - Need money to get breaks fixed </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was in an accident, the insurance adjuster decided that my breaks being destroyed is not the fault of the other driver but crappy work from the shop that fixed them. The guy at the shop i found said he'd give me a break cuz of my bad luck and i'd only have to pay 200 but I don't have the other 100$ right now. My husband get's paid on Friday but he said if i don't pick up the car by Monday I'll have to pay storage fees and the full price for the job of 300$ which will balloon into 500$ because the cars been there since the 1st because of the problems. 

I don't like to ask for help. I'll pay it back by the 19th when the hubby's check clears. And if you're at all worried I'm full of shit, i'll pm you the name and phone number of the mechanic shop and you can call them and pay it by phone. 

My son has autism and i kinda need the car back to get to his various doctor appointments. Which is one of the reasons why the guy gave me a 100$ discount. Cuz he said he too ask a kid with autism but he can't just do jobs for free. So if 10 people can give 10$ a pop i can give a request via bluebird amex and then i'll repay you all plus an extra 2$ for each 10$ by the first week of August or alternatively I can just give the 100$ to someone back by the 19th.

Thanks in advance. 

**edit** *I was able to get someone to pay me to clean their home so I only need 60$ now. I can also do things like cross stitch, i make some pretty cool handmade cards and bookmarks and i have my own cross stitch program and can make you patterns for 5$ a pop* </TEXT>

<TITLE> 90 days today plus a problem </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-15 12:15:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So today hits 90 days. I no longer have any desire to drink myself unconscious. I'm going to discuss with my therapists the idea of moderation management. **or smart recovery or something else**

This is mainly due to the disgusting interactions with people from AA I really do want to rethink some things about what is acceptable and permissive in terms of sobriety.

Moat recently, my former sponsor and the head elder in my church, yelled at me and became very verbally abusive when I asked him a question about the prayer thing at meetings. According to my churches teaching one is not supposed to join others of different faiths in prayer. And also as a hold over from my atheism I do not feel comfortable praying in public outside of my own home or the church. So because I asked him these things he said I clearly just want to drink, called me a stupid bitch, blasphemied, told me I don't know shit, that he's older than me and been sober longer than I and that if I don't do things exactly how he does them that I'm obviously trying to drink. 

And then he proceeded to call me over and over again yelling and cussing at me so loud that my husband who I joke with about how he's going deaf could clearly hear him. And he txted me and txted me over and over again so many times that I had to beg him to stop.

I don't know what to do or think. And the worst part is everyone is taking his side. None care that he was verbally abusive to me. Not even the members of my church. I'm sick of the whole thing. And everyone wants me to apologize to him for asking him a question.

Edit: I wrote this at 5 am after a panic attack and forgot to finish my original statements about alternative programs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I stumbled across this article about the meaning of Sobriety and what it means to recover from Alcoholism. You can read it here: [Reason.com Article on the meaning of Sobriety and Recovery](http://reason.com/archives/2014/03/22/alcoholics-recovery-and-sobriety-meaning)

I had been thinking about this lately as I had an argument with someone about my decision to take part in communion and as per my profession of faith we use real wine in communion (however it's not really wine once it's been consecrated but that's a convo for /r/Christianity or something) and I take communion at least 2 times a week. The person said I was fooling myself by calling myself sober. 

However, after reading this Reason.com article, i'm thinking maybe it's true there isn't one strict and fast definition of sobriety. Thoughts? </TEXT>

Private Confession and Absolution
Lutheran Pastors in general
My pastor in specific
Communion
Seeing my son baptised today was awesome, I wish i had been baptized in a Lutheran Church. 

And just everything in general.

<DATE> 2014-03-18 02:12:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **i figured i should post this here cuz i post here too**

I woke up this morning at 4:30 am still drunk from the night before. I was still tired, still wanted to go to sleep. But I was afraid that if I were to go back to sleep that I would most certainly die by choking on my own vomit if I were to do so. Over the course of the night, i had drank way more than i had drank in my life, yes even as an active alcoholic i never drank as much as i drank in one night as i did last night. I think i drank enough to kill a small human.

I woke up with a vague recollection of some things, that i had to piece together by asking other people and txt message logs and shit like that. I was quite seriously out of it. I had only ever blacked out or browned out once in my life (tho, if it was more, would i really know?). I drunk texted someone who is like a co-sponsor, the person who got me to even think about quitting drinking. And he's quite pissed (i'm always worried that he's pissed but this time i know it's serious). I've pissed off a quite understanding Pastor friend of mine, who is in the program and is not the kind of person who gets angry (he's a lutheran pastor and they are seriously just happy that someone asks for help).

Why did I drink? Well, It started with a panic attack on wednesday night, i awoke at 3am with an intense pressure in my body, the same pressure i've had before when having panic attacks and didn't want to go to the ER at 3am. So i took what was handy which were some percocets that i got from my MIL. Yes, i know, i need to stop taking pills from her. I'm working on that. So I took some and went back to sleep cuz they mellowed me out. Then went about my day, things went great, i did some big things with church and stuff was very happy felt the best i had in a while, was so happy to have turned a corner. Later that day, i was sitting at home and decided to for no reason in particular to take a handful of percocet. woke up sick, took a few more, went about my day. woke up sick, went to therapy, felt like a dick for using, told 1 friend.

That one friend said i need to come clean. Asked around the webchat on sunday, was told i need to come clean about relapsing. Didn't want to have to go in and say, I FUCKED UP. Especially since, someone in a meeting (my former sponsor) told me I was going to relapse because I wasn't doing it for myself so it was going to happen. This was in response to me saying that, I didn't want to drink but was afraid I was going to relapse. I don't want to give them the satisfaction that they're right. I didn't. So upon stress due to the pressure of having to be truthful, I drank. And I drank more than ever before because I couldn't deal with all the AA and shit that i've got going on in my head. It took a lot to get me past that feeling of guilt and shame.

But now i know, this shit will fucking kill me if i don't get it together. I can't drink like i did before going to meetings, because the first place i go is guilt. And it'll just be harder and harder because i'm driving away the people that want to help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I made a meeting this morning, it went really well. All the oldtimers were saying how they love seeing me at meetings and one guy gave me a hug and a kiss on the cheek. (I relish any kind of positive approval from older men). Got like 25 days or so. My sober date is 2/6/14 so idk if 3/6/14 makes 1 month or not i'll leave it up to someone else. 

But in the past few hours i've had this killer headache, it's kinda faded a bit now but it's still there. And i just kinda miss using and drinking. I suppose it started with me wanting to take some percocets for the headache (and wishing i had some available). The headache has lasted mostly for like 3 or 4 days. I think it's stress related but Idk what I'd be stressing about. 
I just know that if i took like 4 percocets right now I'd have no headache. I guess maybe i just feel lonely and shit. I don't even know why. Who the fuck knows. I feel mad losery after having a decent day and last week was pretty good too. Hung with some AAers, learned that I won't grow into an asshole like the people that raised me, and now i just don't know what the fuck is my problem. 

Idk just trying to get it out so i wont seethe in the feeling.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I'm all done the waiting period since my uterine surgery and we're going to start trying. I've read some articles and stuff and I'm just trying to figure out how necessary the Ovulation Predictor Kits are? Do I need them right off the bat? Should I just start going at it at first or start doing the temperature first?
I've just stopped the progesterone pills that i had to take the doctor said it shouldn't take very long for it to leave the system but that it depends so there's that too. 

Any advice? Books I should buy things like that. Just so much questions and the doc was basically like it depends upon me but to just try that the main problem was probably the fibroids and such before as he didn't see any problems when he did my work up but we didn't do the more invasive tests because there was the fibroids/adenometriosis that was going on before so we're supposed to try and then see where we're at in a few months, but I really wanna give it the best shot so any advice is good.

The CleanTime app counts days, minutes, seconds and stuff like that and you get notified of cool day count markers like if you hit 111 or 666 or something like that supposedly. 

I also had an [AA specific app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.deanhuff.companion) but it isn't installed right now. But that one is also pretty good.

<TEXT> If you read the story in [John 9:1-3] it's this story of The disciples asking God why someone was born blind. So what does this mean? Does this mean God purposely makes peoples children disabled cuz he thinks its a good idea? It seems like it's massively terrible for god to do something like that. 

  As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth. 2 And his disciples asked him, Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind? 3 Jesus answered, It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be displayed in him.

<TEXT> In January when I was still using a friend offered to give me some of their pain killers next time they saw me. I haven't seen them since and as such I've cleaned myself up (11 days today) and started going to meetings again and such. 

I saw them yesterday and they were like "Oh, here's those pills I promised you". Before I even realized what I was doing I was holding them in my hand and putting them into my jacket pocket. Until I realized No subject4454, We can't do day Zero again. We can't do this anymore. So I resolved I was going to take them to the pharmacy and give them to the pharmacist. But god help me i don't want to. I obsessively counted them things thinking about how many days I'd have and then went down the road of what I'll do next, when they run out. They gave me what to them should be a months supply. so I can't go back in 5 days and ask "you got anymore?" they'd give them to me if they had them for sure but they'd wonder about me. Just going thru my head of all the things i'd have to do. And if anyone else could hear those conversations, they'd think i was crazy. 

And yes, i get that I should tell her that I have a problem so this doesn't happen again but Shes one of those people that believes that "addiction is a personal moral failing" as opposed to a disease so she'd just look at me like some kind of loser. 

Idk why i am posting this. Maybe it's to get enough voices to drown out the voice of my addiction. Or maybe once I see it all written out, i'll realize i'm being a massive jerk and get it together and flush them. but I really don't know.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **TL;DR: do shit for yourself once and a while even if you have very large responsibilities or you'll look for the easiest and not always healthy way to reduce your stess**

So I failed at my mark but technically it wasn't like i planned it. I had a tumor (it was 12cm) had 2 surgeries to remove it and the pain was pretty hardcore and after taking painkillers since November to deal with the surgeries and stuff i became used to feeling like that. And then i felt like a failure for becoming addicted and drank a bit one day. 

But I learned something, 1 I like the feeling because my life is hard, i have a very difficult like. Not saying no one elses life is difficult but many of the things i deal with are very rough that most people don't have to deal with. Because I have to deal with difficult things (my son has autism and theres other shit going on too) i end up putting the people that need more ahead of me. And so I don't do stuff for myself. I basically ignored the tumor for 2 years til it got so bad i was in constant pain and very ill, because i didn't want to take time away from my responsibilities. 

The only way i've found to relax and yet remain always there was by picking up a drink or a pill. Nothing ever is very healthy about that. And I do show up, Even when drinking all my responsibilities were met, i wasn't going above and beyond but i was meeting my very difficult responsibilities. 

But I realized, i don't do stuff for myself. Of course my therapist has told me this, my husband has told me this, and other people have told me this, but i'm always extremely concerned with making sure things are taken care of. 

I didn't even want to buy myself a winter coat because i didn't want to spend the money on myself when i could spend it on my son or debt or some other thing. And about 2 weeks ago it was so cold that they canceled school because of extreme cold. My husband basically just forced me to buy a coat. He had to force me because I often will return things that people buy me and then get something for my kid. 

But I realized by not doing regular things for myself, like buying myself nice clothes, going to the doctor, splurging on something fun, going out with friends, my only way out did become something quick like a beer or a pill and really everyone needs a way to get stress out and i basically refused because I didn't want to do for myself because i'm so concerned for my family.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I was having an argument (and what is reddit for rather than to assist in solving disputes) about how Classical music does the same themes as other more popular genres. 

Basically the argument went that Classical music isn't about anything (or only about jesus or something to that effect) because there are no words where as Pop and Country music can be about anything including adultery, fighting, revenge, getting drunk, and heartbreak and thus is superior for that reason. 

Everything that I could think of were Operas but if you can think of any especially songs without words that were about any of those things I'd greatly enjoy it.  </TEXT>

"You're hard to feel," he said.
The girl looked at him, she was uncomfortable, and unsure what that meant. To ask would mean to admit she didn't know something, but to just stand there was painful to her. She stood there looking into his brown eyes, saying nothing.

"Can I have a cigarette," she asked.

"Sure."

"Thanks. Can I lay my head on your shoulder while we wait? I'm a little tired."

"Sure."

They sat down on the hard cement ground, backs against the side of an empty brick building and waited. He tried to rub her shoulder casually, but she moved her shoulder til he stopped. She smoked her cigarette til it was done and then lay her head on his lap and fell asleep. He stroked her head then, cuz she couldn't stop him. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I've achieved something that i once thought was unattainable. Ninety days! 

Tho, now my worst fear is realized. All the old timers at the AA meetings would say that once you hit 90 days that they make you start speaking (mainly cuz no one wants to speak). And yes, I was asked to speak at a meeting next week, thankfully, i get a week to prepare. The old timers told me that they'd basically force you to speak the day that you got your 90 days. 

So I'm nervous about that a bit, but I Aced the heck out of my public speaking class in college so time to put that into work. lol now to try and remember what I learned. Something about being in your underwear, idk i'll figure it out later. 

Also just want to give a big thank you to all the people that I owe for this feat, all you magnificent people who dealt with me when i was being an insufferable bitch and helped me when i couldn't help myself. And that's why I'm not all boned today. 

Thanks.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I converted like a month or two ago I guess it was around labor day. When i first converted I was all very enthused about the word and stuff, and reading a lot, l read the catechism with explanations and more i was reading like tons of chapters of the bible a day and praying in the morning and night. And attempting to at meals tho, i did forget constantly. 

Now, I haven't read my bible in a week, and I never remember the pray and even when i do i'm like meh about it. Plus I still enjoy debating christians who hold what i feel to be bad theology. (like ones that wish that god visits bad things upon you for disagreeing with them)

<DATE> 2013-09-29 21:08:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So... I visited 3 separate churches (you may remember that I was at one point an atheist and i started visiting, had a few questions and such)

Church 1, was nice, the pastor was nice, he seemed genuinely concerned. In terms of the sacrament, They listed the creeds and such and then say, "If this is not your belief, you may come forward with your arms crossed over your chest to receive a blessing"

Church 2, was nice, a fbfriend invited me, I really enjoyed it, it was kinda far, but that was okay with me, In terms of the sacrament, they stated "Communicants are those who are confirmed members of Holy Trinity or another congregation of the LC-MS"

Church 3, was okay, I didn't particularly like it tho, a few phones went off during the service and i was a bit peeved for those peoples lack of respect, you can silence a phone. Their communion practices kinda bugged me. Their little booklet stated: We invite all baptized Christians who are truly sorry for their sins and believe that the bread and wine is Jesus' true body and blood to partake of the sacrament.

I settled on Church 2 because of their closed communion beliefs and i liked the pastor and how things were done. 

I've started the classes, i've been a bit concerned because i do have doubts in regards to my belief in God, because you know, i was an atheist from a kid with a minor veer off into mainstream Christianity post 9/11. I don't know if I should mention anything to the pastor about my doubts because idk if it's a temporary thing or an ongoing thing. 

Also while I know that the church teaches that the communion is the real blood and body of christ, I can't help but be concerned that I as a recovering alcoholic will have some issues with drinking even a sip of wine, and i'm a bit scared to mention it to the pastor as i worry that he'll think ill of me or something. 

Idk anyways that's about it. I still feel weird at church cuz my son is autistic and makes a bit of noise and laughs inappropriately during the service at times. And my weekly excitement for it has lessened significantly. Also I forget to pray continually, in the morning, at night, at meal times, idk how to remember and such. 

idk... just wanted to up date you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a recent believer and still looking at churches to try with my very limited knowledge to find a church that practices Christianity properly. 

So I'll have little guidance as to what I'm supposed to be doing. I know that I can actually do nothing and that its God that does everything (which is what I gathered from the small catechism) 

But any advice is really welcome.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I've got 47 days today! and such. For the past week I had been depressed in a funk and what not for no particular reason and had been considering drinking and using. So I told some friends we'd not be talking for a bit and stopped going to meetings because I "didn't feel well". (I honestly hadn't felt well, I got a wisdom tooth pulled and it's not healing right so It's kind of the most terrible thing ever). 

Any who. So this morning I was gonna sleep in having been unable to sleep until almost 3am. But while I was sleeping I dreamt I was at an AA meeting with two of my favorite meeting buddies saying "meeting makers make it" and "when i feel like that, i get my ass to a meeting." so I woke up realized i'd only be a few minutes late and got my ass to the meeting.

I guess being sober and the things I do to stay sober have become such a part of me that if i don't go to any meetings eventually, my brain will just make one up for me to go to. 

I hope everyone is having some good success with their sobriety, if you aren't give it time, one day at a time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm an atheist (I'm totally going to have my atheist card revoked) but I've been talking to this Lutheran pastor dude that is a friend of a friend and he said that I should attempt to attend a service at a missouri synod lutheran church. and So I want to try one out, since i had wanted and answer to my questions about God, Jesus, the Universe and everything.

But what exactly is a service like? I've not been to one, I've only ever been to a very contemporary christian church where they played like Jeremy Camp music and a very culty Pentacostal church where they just did stuff until like the "holy spirit told them to stop" (which was very annoying as you'd end up listening to someone ramble on for like hours). 

So anyways, I want to know what it's like. My son has autism and I suspect he might not be very quiet for the service. should i go without him? Also do i have to dress up, I don't dress up, i even got married in casual wear. Do chicks have to wear skirts? Do i need to cover up my tattoos. I don't want to be disrespectful but I do wanna just be myself.  </TEXT>

Which brought me to an interesting conversation with people on Facebook, apparently a number of Americans think that it should be illegal to say mean things to people. 

But where does it stop at what point are we living in a world where you can never say anything bad about anyone or anything. Is it libertarian to think that a person can say whatever they want? I mean supposedly you can't yell fire in a crowded theater (but shouldn't adults be responsible for making sure that's a credible threat before freaking out and trampling people to death?)

<TEXT> Where I live it's basically just masturbation to attempt to get a libertarian voted in, as most of our politicians are either Democrats or Democrats lite. And all of them big government types. So I was wondering from your perspectives. What's the best way to enact the change towards more libertarian ideals? 

Would it be infiltrating a Republican or Democrat committee and starting to get them to agree with Libertarian positions. 

Or just go all out trying to slowly teach people what Libertarianism is all about and why they should go 3rd party. And then wait 20 years for that to happen?

Of course there are probably other options I'm not thinking of and I would like to limit this to local politics over national as I think the whole national politics is basically a long drawn out American Idol President edition anyways.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow I can't believe I made it to 30 days. Of course it isn't dramatically easier. Just smelling liquor gives me enough temptation that I feel like Jack Torrence in the shining. I'd sell my soul to be able to take a drink again. 

But I just don't drink  today and then try it again tomorrow. 

Was it easy these 30 days? No, my car got towed and booted. Wanted to drink. Had to deal with all manner if the issues that come with raising a child living with autism. Dealing with all manner of marital issues and guilt from drinking. So it wasn't a Rollerblade thru the park, nor a walk.
But I got thru it by doing today and then trying again the next day.

<TEXT> I'm dealing with the just consequences of my drinking days. I had a bunch of parking tickets and i didn't pay them and because I didn't pay them in a timely manner my car got booted. It's abotu to be towed cuz I didn't have all the moneys that they wanted. 

I also have some other issues with the car that need to be fixed, which are due to me texting and driving. *word to the wise: don't text and drive*. 

Also I relapsed and i didn't want to say a damn thing about it because I just wanted to get that magical 30 days coin and somehow that would keep me sober, even tho i wasn't sober. So i lied about it to my friends and sponsor. 

My sponsor is none to thrilled with me. my friends are beign very distant. And it makes me very sad.

I don't do sad, i don't do feelings. All i want to do is drink or use drugs. but if i do that my friends will remain very distant and even just straight up not be friends with me. I don't have many friends. So the 2 friends i do have are like my bestest friends in the world. They are both in recovery so I see why they'd be like this it's understandable.

I've taken to engaging in self-destructive non-substance related behavior to deal with my emotional pain. It's probably not the healthiest thing but I just don't want to drink/use drugs and I honestly dont' care that i'll have to deal with the consequences of that behavior. 

Hopefully this story stops someone else from drinking and ruining their lives.  </TEXT>

I got a half ass hug in the morning and the obligatory fb wall posts. 
My parents didn't even call to say what's up. 

This in addition to the fact that everyone always thinks everything I do has some sinister motive and that my face is swollen due to emergency oral surgery yesterday. 

I'm in pain and nauseous. 

My cars suspension is fucked, and that costs a few whole paychecks worth of money to fix. I lost my favorite thing in the world recently and I won't be able yo get another til late August. 
And I'm turning 30 and have accomplished none of the things I set out for myself. 

I can barely think of a reason not to drink or use drugs. Cuz I'd enjoy this emotional pain to go away. 

I'm 30, a failure and a loser and I don't know why I'm posting this. I know if I reset my day count I won't go back to a meeting, so I'm hoping this stops me somehow.

And I am usually a very negative person who gets stuck allowing bad thoughts to live rent free in my mind. I'll let others and their issues control my feelings. But right now I'm really working on thinking about my higher power and how he thinks about these things. 

And I just want to be around the people, places and things that make me feel like a better person or that I can be a better person. 

So if you are struggling try to go out of your way to avoid negative people, places and things. Also when those thoughts come try to think about if they are a reality or if they even matter. 
Also remember that, who you are inside is what helps you make and do everything in life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Went to two meetings yesterday on a promise. After the second meeting All I was thinking was how, I was jerk for looking down on people because of their religious beliefs and how because of this, I should drink. 

I didn't drink. I went home. Got stuck in behind a beer truck on the way home for 30 minutes in traffic. Just looked at it getting thirsty. Surely, I thought, I could drink just one beer. I didn't drink. Got home, made dinner, by them i'm all angry at life, it's pouring outside, i had to run back to the car to get the spaghetti sauce I left in the trunk, i got soaked, kept thinking, running out in the rain is totally an excuse to drink. But I went in the house, made spaghetti and looked at the big book and didn't drink. 

Kid goes to sleep, husbands at work. I'm all alone on a friday night, felt like Every single tv show i put on was talking about drinking. 

Texted a friend asked, "Will you hate me forever if I reset myself back to day 0." was hoping for a no, then it would be okay if i drunk. He texted back, "No, but i'll be mad at you for a while." used my numbers to make it thru til i was sleepy and watched some Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood (it's the new version of Mr. Rogers Neighborhood). The positive messages of that show, and others got me thru to Day 2. 

Those were honestly the hardest 48 hours i've had in a long time.

<TEXT> I went because a friend asked me to. I was not fond of it. As I'm very Judgy and didn't think I would ever be seen hanging out with those people if I had a choice. 

Before going I was nervous that everyone would think I was a loser for going to AA, then I was worried that I wouldn't be enough of an alcoholic to be at AA and they'd all be mean to me. Then when I got there I was like I'm way better than everyone here.

And then I started rationalizing because I can have just one drink if life necessitates it. Plus I'm kind of a dick when it comes to people who believe in god because I think its childish so then i put people in a box. 

I've promised him that I'd go to another meeting tomorrow and try not to be so judgy. 

Idk what to do because while I know I'm going nowhere drinking it still seems like the best way to deal with all my problems.

I know the drinking doesn't fix the student loan debt that I have and can't pay and I know that it won't get me unfired. And it won't magically improve my writing. But damn it feels good to just forget. 

Any advice is welcome.

<TEXT> I'm sure my life is much less than it could be if I didn't drink. I'm sure I've lost a job at one of the largest companies and most well known companies in the world because of my drinking. And I'm sure that it isn't normal for me to drink like 6 drinks a night and barely feel anything. 

And I've recently developed the problem of when I have my first beer of the day my hands get shakey until I drink more. But not before. Its weird Idk if that ever happened to anyone else. 

My question is does it get better. Will I ever get over the stink of my past job ruining past. If I stop drinking and things don't change what's the point. I'd be living a shit life with no distraction. 

So basically anyone who ever screwed up big time were you able to get back to where you should have been? Or better. 

I probably sound like an asshole. And I am one because I am holding on to alcohol like it is some kind magic that will keep my life from sucking. </TEXT>

My car is making a weird noise once I get over 30mph. The video above is the car on the highway at 40 to 50 mph. 

Its a Plymouth voyager 2000. 

It started making this sound about the time I ran over a rather heinous pot hole. 

I think it may be a CV joint problem or possibly the tires are unbalanced buy before I spend a lot of dough I wanted to run it by you all. also one of my front tires has a dent in it. I think it may be a bubble. 

Any feedback is appreciated. Thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, I'm trying to get out of here, NYC by the end of June to not have to pay July rent. I'm looking for apartments on line but I'm scared to 1) sign a lease over the internet and 2) getting screwed. 

So far most of the rentals that I've liked are by cpm. I'm trying to spend the least for a 2 br. I can until I find employment over there. I think 700$ is a good price, I'm not 100% on that. 

I'm trying to find apartments or houses for rent that aren't long leases so if it sucks I'm not in roachville for 12 months or hood island for 12 months. 

I am willing to pay someone to inspect the apartments but in the meanwhile does anyone know where one can find rentals for Omaha? I'm looking for a 2 br. In a neighborhood that doesn't have constant shootouts </TEXT>

<TEXT> I live in NYC (the land of high taxes, annoying jerks, and so many hidden fees). And have had a hard time finding work for the past year or so. and since we were all done with our college and we hate NYC anyways we started trying to decide to leave the area. 

I read an article about the 20 best cities to start over again in this economy and out of all of them Omaha seemed to be the best one. It beat out Idaho Falls, Idaho and Columbia, MO as well as Jacksonville, FL (my spouse loves Disney and wanted to go to Florida for that). 

However, I've never been there and my kid has autism. i read there was a very good private autism education and supposedly Federal Laws guarantee special education so that should be okay. 

But I'd be moving there with one 1 week trip to go find apartments and such and with none of us having any jobs. 

So my question is, Is it A) hard to get a job in Omaha? (I know that unemployment is at 3.7% over there or 4.2% or something but is it easy for someone with a degree to find a job, any job). and B) is it nice over there? Anything you hate? and C) is it easy to find apartments? is North Omaha really as bad as they say? Keep in mind I'm from NYC and have lived in some sketchy neighborhoods.  </TEXT>
