<TEXT> I'm not one for the paranormal. I'm quite a logical person really, but the past few days events have left me feeling uncomfortable in my sanity and my beliefs.

Things started suddenly in my house Thursday last week. I live by myself, with my dog BooBoo (Yeah, dumbass name, I know.) I have lived here for nearly a year, and I have never felt intimidated by the house at all. 

So anyway... on Thursday morning, my mum texted me saying she was coming around about 11am, which is fine. She usually just walks in and makes herself a cuppa tea or whatever, usually I am in the shower when she comes around. But on Thursday morning, I was up bright and early and was sat in my living room doing my hair and make up when I hear the front door slam. The hallway is right on the living room so I can pop my head out the door and see who is there, but I had my hair in my straighteners so I just yelled out ''BooBoo, who is it?'' thinking it would be my mother. Boo was going mental, yapping and huffing, so I put my head out of the living room door to yell at him to shut up and to also greet my mother.

There was no-one there, and the keyring was swinging in the lock from side to side, like something had caused the door to slam heavily. The door is a big, solid PVC door that can't swing open by the wind as it has a double latch system. I wrote it off as perhaps the postie, even though there was no mail, or maybe I didn't shut the door properly, even though I hadn't been out that day, or the evening before.

I didn't really think much else about that. I am not a superstitious person. However, on Saturday night something happened that creeped me the fuck out. it was about 1am on Saturday night and I was in bed, just starting to drift off, BooBoo snuggled up at my feet snoring gently. All of a sudden I feel him tense up under the duvet, and then I hear him ''huuurrrrrrrfff...HURF'' before going into a full blown barking fit. I calm him down, settle him back in bed and start to drift off again when I hear a tap....tap....tap on the stairs.

My stairs are wooden, and the noise was identical to the noise BooBoos collar tag makes on the steps as he pads up at night. He is a Jack Russell, so his little short legs make this possible. I counted the taps... tap.... tap... tap. I counted fourteen of them - which I realised was the amount of steps I had leading from downstairs to upstairs. I pulled the duvet over my head like a little kid and drifted off into an unsettled sleep.

But what has really took the cherry off the cake, was what has happened this morning. I took a shower as usual, got out and padded across the tile floor, across the wooden floor landing and into my bedroom to get dried off and presentable for the day. I finished up, and went back into the bathroom to brush my teeth, only to see a set of wet footprints that were not my own going out of the bathroom and down the stairs, and the keyring swinging gently in the front door lock. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I often have dreams about being one of the last people in the world - me and a grou of ''survivors'' living in a massive superstore in the UK called Tesco Extra. You could survive for years in there!

The first thing I would do is go to the Soft Furnishings range and set up beds for everyone by dragging the sofas from the changing rooms. I would make it cosy, with lamps from Home furnishings, a little TV and some makeup areas / changing areas. I'd have a female and male section to respect privacy.

Next thing I would do is make a cooking area, setting up the little electric stoves, a fridge, microwave etc. We would have cutlery, plates, etc etc.

Next on the agenda is toileting - There is toilets in Tesco so that is fine, but I would make them pretty and put in lots of lovely towels and nice soaps. Again, we would have a female and male toilet.

Then I would organise all the food into perishable/non perishable, obviously eating perishable first, but I would organise a vegetable patch out the back of the superstore and plant potatoes and carrots and things, so we could survive long term. We would all live in Tesco and have fun, watching the giant TVs, DVDs, Game Consoles, Books, Toys! It would be amazing! </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was in school, we had a teacher called Mr. Green. He was old, doddery and looked like a turtle. He was brought out retirement, and we used to call him Hans after Hans Moleman from the Simpsons, as he was his doppleganger.

He used to do crazy shit experiments with us, such as lighting magnesium strips on fire and then seeing what happened when you doused them with diesel. I doubt he knew much about health and safety, but he was fucking awesome.

One day, he made us mix some lethal acid with some other chemical shit and observe a reaction. He did this with a bunch of 12 year olds, high on blue food colouring and coca cola, it was bound to go wrong. Well some little dickwad knocks over this acid shit all over Mr. Greens wooden stool accidently. Our chemistry stools had dips in them, shaped for your butt, so all the acid collected in them.

Mr Green always wore plastic-y rubbery trousers that looked like they were for fishing. Because he was so old and pretty unaware of his surroundings, he accidently sat in this stuff. I remember, to this day, him standing up, looking at pieces of his plasticy, rubbery trousers disolving, his saggy old man arse hanging out, proclaiming to the stunned class ''Oh No, I sat in Acid.'' </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lil bit of a back story. I live with my partner but my mum always visits us with my pa, sometimes they stay with us. Their room faces out onto a back yard that then leads onto an ''urban forest'' if that makes sense, trees planted in suburban areas to try and preserve the green belt etc. All that jazz.

Well last night was a usual night, we all went to bed at about 10pm, nothing out of the ordinary as I was working today.

At about 1am in the morning I was woken up by what sounded like stones being ''pinged'' against my window. I was instantly freaked out; my bedroom overlooks a church that has no gravel driveway or indeed anything that could be thrown at the window. 

It went on for about three minutes, a steady tapping that kept shattering the silence that I sat in. Bricks were shat, my friends, bricks were shat.

I managed to muster up the courage to peek out the curtains. As I moved across the bed I woke my partner up, he sleepily says ''that tapping was there last night too...'' 

As I pull back the curtains, I see a streak of... I don't even know what it was. Shadow, I suppose. I see a dark shadow kid of 'blend in' to the darkness. The road outside is lit by dull lights on the church, but this darkness seemed heavy, almost like I was trying to look through deep murky water. This shadow just dissipates into the darkness, I can't compare it to anything because it is unlike anything I've ever seen.

I sat on the edge of my bed looking through the curtains for what seemed like ages. I felt guilty, an unusual feeling like I had intruded on something. I felt cold and isolated...

I manged to settle back into a fitful sleep, punctuated by images of long, thin fingers entwining around my neck, my back, cradling me. I knew what I was experiencing. I knew what it was.

Morning came and fuck... I was scared. I felt afraid. My fear must have hung in the air like a bad smell because everyone seemed to be avoiding me today, tiptoeing around me. 

My mother called me today. Says she had a fucked up dream of a tall, faceless... thing... stood at the end of the bed. Just watching, silently, calculating it's next move. She laughed, says ''he was supremely terrifying, but he was dressed impeccably, in a suit that would not look out of place on a King.''

I know... I have nothing to fear, I know that he's just a fucking figment of over active imagination, but that doesn't stop me from seeing Him stood in the corner, yet when I turn he isn't there. Fuck knows what will happen to me. </TEXT>

I often wonder about him now, last I heard he collected mannequins from shops and had them posed all around his house. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As I was only 17 at the time I couldn't buy drink at our Christmas party. So he started buying me a few drinks, and I made a small flirtation along the lines of ''You're trying to take advantage of me'' etc etc. But after a few I came to realise that he was indeed wanting to take advantage of me. Because I found him exceedingly attractive, I slept with him.

The nastiest place was in him and his wife's bed, it made me feel weird though so we never did it there again. That was at the very start of our affair.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My sister knows, I think my brother has suspicians to. My sister found out after I turned up at her house in one of the swanky cars I get at work which I'm not meant to. She made a joke along the lines of ''are you getting all these cars 'cos you're bedding your boss?'' Which at that point, my stunned silence said it all.

She doesn't approve of it but she knows that it is not just a sexual fling. I know that if I do find the right person, I will end the affair, but at the moment I will carry it on. </TEXT>

We have kept it up for 4 years, we have perfected not being caught and being careful. Most affairs are caught around the one year mark, when people become careless. 

I know if something was going to happen, I would just resign. I have no problems with that. </TEXT>

It will sound dreadful but that is not my problem.  If someone else in our office was the mistress, I still wouldn't feel different for the wife. It's up to her to say something, and it's up to them to work it out.  </TEXT>

I get the best of both worlds with my secret partner - I get affection, I get freedom. I get financial independancy and get showered with gifts. </TEXT>

personally... I look at it this way. He is just as bad as me, if not worse. I can move on quite easily. We are both getting what our lives lack, and it is not a simple case of me shagging him over a desk. We have deep discussions about all manner of things from religion to where we want to be in ten years time. He is a companion to me as well as a sexual partner. I appreciate how you feel, but it is not all me that is doing the wrong. </TEXT>

I'v always been a hard working woman, determined. I wanted the contacts and I wanted the experience of working with a high end company. I used what God has given me - figure, intelligence, being a female etc.

<TEXT> I am in Scotland, UK.

Our closest call was when he was in my office and I was pulling my shirt to the side to tease him. Little did I realise that my blinds had been reversed and the rest of the office could see me flashing at him. Luckily we convinced them that I had been doing it without realising, although we have become more careful.

I did have a boyfriend but because of the excitement in my ''double life'' we drifted apart. I craved the constant thrill and excitement, he wanted to stay in and watch movies. I guess if he was exciting, I would have ended the affair. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been included on trips to prestigious hotels - due to the nature of my work and the location, our courses are over 500 miles away. The car manufacturer is a luxury brand and I have been given a courtesy vehicle even though I am not entitled to one. I think this is partially out of fear and partially out of affection, he wants me to keep on his side in secrecy and in sex.

I have been included on trips with him that are not strictly for me. I always have plenty of excuses for my co workers, I tell them I am a partial Personal Assistant and it is my job to go with my boss to these places. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I knew this was coming!

I bet most people that say they are having an affair are doing it for the sex.

The sex at the beginning was incredible, but I know now that it was because of the thrill of it all. Now, because I know what he likes and he knows what I like, it is like being in a long term relationship. What keeps it exciting is the remaining dread and fear of being caught by someone.  </TEXT>
