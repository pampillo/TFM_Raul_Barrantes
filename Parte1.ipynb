Yes, both watched their loved one die at the hands of a criminal and that caused them to become a costumed crime-fighter.  But Batman was a boy, watched his parents (wealthy philanthropists) die during a robbery after leaving a play or movie. Spider-Man was a mostly grown boy (teen to young adult depending on the writer), already with superpowers, whose uncle (not particularly wealthy at all) was shot by a criminal that he had the power to stop.

So in that case, it makes sense to invest like you said - what you can, when you can. Just do it on a set schedule so you don\\'t start skipping it.  By buying that way, say, once every month, even if you aren\\'t intending to it is still functionally the same thing as DCA, isn\\'t it? Even if you aren\\'t saying \"well, it\\'s a little high right now, so I\\'ll take this 10k and invest 1k a month for the next 10 months\" it\\'s still more or less what you\\'re doing. You just don\\'t have the long term plan. The nice part is you likely end up with a much lower cost basis over time, but you do lose out on the dividends (if applicable) because you didn\\'t have the lump sum invested up front.  If I (or OP) had a lump sum to invest, I would really be torn honestly. I\\'ve been in funds that have lost a TON before. I\\'ve also been in stocks that have gone completely worthless.

Recent reports suggesting increased levels of RNA editing in squids thus raise the question of the nature and effects of these events. We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites. Editing is enriched in the nervous system, affecting molecules pertinent for excitability and neuronal morphology. The genomic sequence flanking editing sites is highly conserved, suggesting that the process confers a selective advantage. Due to the large number of sites, the surrounding conservation greatly reduces the number of mutations and genomic polymorphisms in protein-coding regions. This trade-off between genome evolution and transcriptome plasticity highlights the importance of RNA recoding as a strategy for diversifying proteins, particularly those associated with neural function.

I sent the recipe to my parents, because my dad's trying to eat more fiber, but doesn't like quinoa. Well, he loves this:  2/3 cup dry quinoa, 2/3 cup frozen spinach, Butter or olive oil, 2 cloves garlic (I like a lot, but use small cloves if you don't), 1/2 cup shredded gouda cheese, Lemon juice, Salt and pepper to taste  1. Rinse quinoa in mesh strainer under cold water.  2. Put rinsed quinoa and 1 1/4 cup water in small pot on high.  3. Once it starts boiling, turn heat to low and set timer for 15 minutes.  4. After timer goes off, remove from burner and set aside with lid still on for 5 minutes.   5. While quinoa is cooking, mince garlic and saut in butter or olive oil on medium heat.  6. Before garlic browns, add frozen spinach (I think I used about 2/3 cup). Cook with lid on, stirring frequently, until it thaws and heats up. 7. Add lemon juice, salt, and pepper to taste.  8. Stir in cooked quinoa and 1/2 cup shredded gouda cheese.   Whenever I visit my parents, we make a double recipe. I eat half as my main, and they each eat a quarter as a side with some chicken or whatever. Now, quinoa's not the cheapest thing out there and is harder to find in some areas than others, but this might be good to try as an occasional thing if your local store has it (you can also usually get it cheaper online than in a store).  Oh, and since she likes black beans, here's another super easy, one-pan [quinoa dish](http://damndelicious.net/2014/04/09/one-pan-mexican-quinoa/) I love.

       "  'text': \" I did a case study on what DiCaprio's #PoorLeo meme and Oscar win did to him on social media -- namely Twitter, where he has a verified account.   I found his lack of interaction with the whole #PoorLeo fandom very interesting. His nonparticipation didn't really dampen anyone's enthusiasm. I'm keen to see what will happen to the star now that the meme is over -- will his young and engaged social media following evaporate? Will they find some other aspect of Leo to fixate on? What do you guys think?    Here's a link to the full piece with graphs: https://medium.com/p/how-the-internet-fell-in-love-with-leonardo-dicaprio-c5216e0b8e75  Below is the text:   **Becoming Meme**  Its hard to find a less pitiable man on earth than Leonardo DiCaprio. The actor and environmentalist has achieved stratospheric levels of success. Hes often photographed poolside. And that pool is usually on a yacht.  In the world of film, hes famed director Martin Scorseses favourite leading man and has won awards for his environmentalism and acting. DiCaprio has picked up three Golden Globes, two Critics Choice Awards, and one Scream Award. He even holds two Blockbuster Entertainment Awards: a testament to his long tenure in show business.  Until this year, DiCaprio seemed to have everything but an Oscar.  What did winning an Academy Award do to Leonardo DiCaprio online, and why did the Internet care so much?  The characters DiCaprio played in the early 2010s were often victims of injustice. Young social media users found parallels between DiCaprio and his characters: theyre both unfairly deprived some key ingredient (a family, professional recognition, some sitting room on a giant piece of wood floating in a freezing ocean).  In 2014, when DiCaprio was nominated for his role in The Wolf of Wall Street, the meme reached a fever pitch on Tumblr. More than 180,000 users supported a Tumblr post seething with (mock?) frustration. DiCaprio had been nominated for an Oscar four times, but had never one. On Tumblr, this injustice was too much to bear.  Fuelled by the often-unfortunate characters he portrays, Poor Leo became a popular hashtag on Tumblr with thousands of posts.  Reddit was soon to follow. Posts with DiCaprio in the headline have racked up more than 100,000 upvotes (I stopped counting after the first of many pages of submitted DiCaprio links and text posts).  Still, the actors Twitter account didnt receive much engagement. Leonardo DiCaprio the brand was not as engaging as Leonardo DiCaprio the meme. Between Oscars 2015 and 2016, engagement for the star remained low at 2.3%.  **Poor Leo Goes Viral**  Before Oscars 2016, DiCaprio had what every movie star('s publicity team) dreams of: an engaged, young, and massive following online. Every year, Poor Leo memes grew in popularity. The Poor Leo meme became a sort of Mayan doomsday clock ticking down to the next Oscars. During the show, win or lose, the hundreds of thousands of Tumblr-ers, Redditors, and aggregator readers would react in a huge way.  Every year that Poor Leo lost the meme continued with higher (and funnier) stakes than ever before. In the extremely unlikely event that DiCaprio won, the meme would implode in on itself like a dying star, creating a black hole threatening to break all of social media and do what to the meme himself?  **@LeoDiCaprio Finally Benefits**  For the official @LeoDiCaprio on Twitter, excitement over his long-awaited Oscar translated into a concrete and dramatic spike in engagement. The Crowdbabble graph below shows engagement  likes, comments, and retweets  before and after the show. Can you spot his tweet about his Oscar win?  The giant engagement spike is the response to @LeoDiCaprios post-win message to fans. His tweet about winning attracted 367,729 engagements from more than 100,000 Twitter users within three days. At the time of press, two weeks later, engagement had snowballed.  Engagement with the tweet is now up to 955,465 retweets and likes. Fandom for Poor Leo the meme, it seems, does translate into fandom for Leonardo DiCaprio the actor. The Oscar-winning actor, though, does not participate in conversations on Twitter  even after his win, he was often left out. Mentions of @LeoDiCaprio stayed surprisingly low after his win. Just 20 to 60 tweets per day mentioned @LeoDiCaprio and, as shown above, the account never responded. Perhaps sensing that the actor doesnt tweet himself, Twitter users talked around and about him  they didnt try to include @LeoDiCaprio in the Poor Leo/Validated Leo conversation.  The low number of mentions shows that the meme still operates independently of his official brand. The high engagement for his tweets, however, indicates that his official account was able to capture the enthusiasm generated by the Poor Leo meme. The actor didnt lose a huge number of users between the grassroots fandom and his official account  no small feat for a big movie brand. To compare, Brie Larsons post-win message on her official social account (Instagram) attracted 88,757 likes and comments. Thats fewer than 10% of DiCaprios 1m retweets and likes.  **After the Win, What Now?**  Leonardo DiCaprio has what no other Hollywood actor does: a very special relationship with the Internet. But the little golden statue that solidified Leonardo DiCaprios status as a bankable, talented A-List actor may have also killed his covetable online fandom. Now that DiCaprio has his Oscar, the running Poor Leo joke is over. The thrill is gone: each Oscar run from now on will have much lower stakes. Subsequent awards seasons are unlikely to generate the thousands of meme posts and comments on Tumblr and Reddit that they did before the win.  Between February 28 and March 3 2016, in the wake of his win and almost-1,000,000 engagements, @LeoDiCaprio gained 179,500 new followers on Twitter.  But engagement with DiCaprios account, from March 3 to March 7, is back down to 0%.  Perhaps DiCaprios massive Poor Leo fandom will find a new way to celebrate Validated Leo. The thousands of social media users who enjoyed the Poor Leo meme might wait in suspense each awards season to see if the win becomes a streak. Maybe the actor will begin choosing roles that do not end with unjust horror in candlelit crypts or creepy mental hospitals  characters who get what they want (the dawn of a new Strutting Leo era on screen). Maybe Reddit and Tumblr users will find some other void in DiCaprios life to fixate on, and Poor Leo will re-emerge.  How can Leo take advantage of this big social media following -- particularly on Reddit and Tumblr -- now that #PoorLeo is over? Thoughts? \",\n",

       "  'text': ' It depends upon what you mean by \"many\". An accurate estimate is hard to come by, but let\\'s try something with a few assumptions. Let\\'s set up a little game of \\'statistics\\'. The first thing you have to understand - and accept and realize the implications of - is that for every person who may criticize Obama \"from the left\" there are something like 20,000 people of other political views. I may be *generous* to \\'the left\\' with this, and I am lumping in *all* forms of leftism in one mass.  Now let\\'s assume that about 50% of these people with *other* views are more or less approving of Obama and either ignorant of or in disagreement with the views of people \\'to the left of Obama\\'. That leaves a number of the order of about 10,000. This means that for every \\'leftist\\' post on a place like r/socialism if you went by pure chance there would be 10,000 people hitting on it who like Obama and only one who looks at him \\'from the left\\'.   Here comes the tricky part. How many of these people might have a more or less favourable view of a word like \\'socialism\\'. This varies from country to country. It would be lowest in the USA but higher in other parts of the \\'anglosphere\\' such as Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and goodly numbers of people in countries such as India, Pakistan, etc. where English is a lingua franca in multilingual nations. Let\\'s try and set a low enough number such as 5%, one in 20. This reduces the likelihood to 500 to one that the viewer would be such an \\'Obama friendly\\' person.  There are, of course, other factors that reduce this still further. Suppose that only 10% of the population are interested enough in politics to cruise the internet looking for subjects such as Obama (a quite high number) or socialism (a lower number). Now we\\'re down to 50 to 1. A certain number immediately flee when they see their Saint criticized, are already heavily prejudiced against Obama and the left in general (already accounted for above), react with anger at the criticism, don\\'t think it\\'s important and skip over it or have sensible arguments about why \"Obama is still a better deal\" because of realism. Let\\'s say 90% to 95% of the population bow out because of such things. That still leaves 2.5 to 5 people made up of \\'Obama believers\\' to one \\'lefty believer\\'.  Now the final reduction. From pure \\'interest\\' let\\'s say that a \\'lefty\\' is 100 times more likely to keep coming back to a place like r/socialism. This leaves a 2.5 to 5 percent chance that an \\'Obama believer\\' might see such an item and that it registers. This compares *very* favourably with the chances of the usual leftist propaganda, a goodly amount of which is *much* more likely to drive people away than to make the average person reconsider.  Yes, there is a small but not infinitesimal chance that this might do some good. I hope, but don\\'t necessarily believe, that socialists of all stripes might actually *want* to spread their ideas and don\\'t depend on \\'conversion experiences\\' such that other people will accept their views all in a lump like St. Paul on the way to Damascus. It\\'s better and far more likely to change opinions bit by bit. I *know* that certain purist rhetoric drives people away in huge numbers, and I also hope that if it is unlikely that people of different views might visit a site such as r/socialism that people would have enough common sense to understand that this is a **bad thing** that should be changed and nothing to be proud of. I *did* post the item in other places as well by the way.   ',\n",

       "  'text': ' The reason Lincoln eventually became anti-Slavery late in the war is that he realize it was the root cause of the Civil War.    The country couldn\\'t exist with it and not fight Civil Wars.  If you ban it, then you get rid of the root problem of the war.     The Confederacies own leaders said they were fighting the war for slavery.   The Cornerstone Speech by Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens explains point black the the Southern States were attempting to found a new nation based on \"\"upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition\".    So Lincoln decided that to win the war for real, Slavery had to be eliminated.   After the war, the former Southern leaders took to rewriting their own history to say that they were fighting for other things.   Normally bringing up States Rights, but also talking about the Southern Agrarian Economy, Tax issues, Tariff policies,  etc.   But each of those alternate explanations for the war are all really just the slavery question in disguise.    Southern Economy was based on slavery.   Tax issues, around profits made from goods produced by slavery.   Tariffs on products again produced by slavery.   States rights, to own people as farm animals.    Slavery is the core issue the war was about.    Every other issue involved in the war was, at it\\'s heart, also the slavery issue.    After the war, Confederate General James Longstreet was asked what the Civil War was fought over.  His response was simple:  \"If it wasn\\'t about slavery, then I don\\'t know what else it was about\".   He knew what his war was about.  Saying it was about anything else is outright lying.    Frederick Douglass became one of the people who helped turn Lincoln into the *Great Emancipator* after his death.    Douglass understood that Lincoln had figured out that the root cause of the war was slavery and that he then fought to destroy the very institution that caused the war.   ',\n",

THC by itself yields an intense, overwhelming high at a proper dose - which could be a single toke if you're vaporizing refined oil.  You could test this hypothesis in part by eating a dose.  If it yields a potent high like it does when vaporized, you can assume that the oil is not CBD dominant - in this case, it may be synthetic cannabinoids mislabeled as another person suggested.  If it yields little psychoactive effect taken orally, then you may have an oil that is primarily CBD with a significant amount of THC as well.

       "  'text': \" I think the late story is a result of writers loving their characters a bit too much. It's certainly something I did when I started writing: your babies are the characters, not the story. The writer wants to introduce his/her characters without any distractions, so we can come to love them as much as they do. So it's forty pages of character introductions, before a story arrives to put them to use. There's nothing that says we can't meet the characters *and* begin a story at the same time. Trial by fire: we learn who the characters are, as they're battling the story conflict.   Maybe the problem is also a case of misidentification: us meeting the characters *isn't part of the story*. The story needs to be self-contained; introducing the heroes to the external audience isn't Chapter One.   As for the RECOMMEND scripts, there's nothing I could really do with them. I can't reveal specifics about those scripts, obviously, so there's little I could say. Besides, there's no secret winning strategy those 8 scripts nailed. They just had good stories and told them well. It's such a case-by-case business; there's never any hard-and-fast rule to writing a good script.   To get a RECOMMEND, you need to do everything right; to get a CONSIDER, you just need to do one thing right. You need a good premise, or a fun protagonist, or an engaging voice, or a remarkable ending: you need one strong element that catches my attention and makes the script worth considering. There have been a lot of cases where I've written CONSIDER WITH RESERVATIONS (for the premise): the script was terrible, but it had a good idea buried within it -- it just didn't know what to do with it. \",\n",

The Totten Ice Shelf in East Antarctica, which buttresses a marine-based ice sheet with a volume equivalent to at least 3.5 m of global sea-level rise, also experiences rapid basal melt, but the role of ocean forcing was not known because of a lack of observations near the ice shelf. Observations from the Totten calving front confirm that (0.22  0.07)  10^6 m^3 s^1 of warm water enters the cavity through a newly discovered deep channel. The ocean heat transport into the cavity is sufficient to support the large basal melt rates inferred from glaciological observations. Change in ocean heat flux is a plausible physical mechanism to explain past and projected changes in this sector of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and its contribution to sea level. ',\n",

       "  'text': \" As someone who works IT (both enterprise and for the uninformed masses) Windows 8 Defender is really quite good, especially when comparing to other popular free AV's. I'm not saying it's the best and I'm not saying its perfect; it's far from both. But as a pre-installed and always free/updated AV, its an excellent solution for most.   I can't tell you how many times I see a copy of Norton that expired 3 years ago, or AVG that is constantly popping up asking to give permissions for everything (not counting TONS of false positives). 90% of people that have computers don't know what they're looking at, and that's where the true beauty of Defender comes in... almost everything is done discretely in the background, without annoying warnings or pop-ups. Personally, I think it does a great job against more serious malware. Compared to Windows 7 and prior, I see WAY fewer rogue infections or infections that seriously disable the functionality of the computer since Windows 8 came out. It used to be there was at least one solid virus a year that infected TONS of computers... remember that FBI rogue infection and all the fake AV rogues before that? There hasn't been anything nearly as wide spread since Windows 8 with Defender launched.  Realistically however, all of the common free AV's perform so similarly that it really doesn't matter a ton. Also, you have to consider how widespread UEFI is now and how that effects things. The real magic is done with the on-demand scanners anyway :P \",\n",

       "  'text': \"  *This is the relevant portion of the article, which was originally written by the user 'coc' in CBF: http://www.cornerofberkshireandfairfax.ca/forum/fairfax-financial/what-percentage-of-your-portfolio-is-in-fairfax-financial/30/*  Im surprised you all let this go. Id like to comment on two things, both of which I consider nonsense.  1. It is very easy to find securities that will outperform the market.  2. Holding Fairfax is inferior to running around finding these very easy securities.  I think investors vastly underestimate how good Warren Buffett was at his job back in the 1950s and 1960s when he was buying these niche securities. Hes even better now, but obviously runs so much capital that his returns are lower. There seems to be this Buffett envy going on in value investing circles whereby investors feel the need to look for little cigar butts similar to what Warren used to  largely influenced by his talks to students and his biography.  And yet, I have seen precious few investors who have successfully done it. Beyond the platitude that smaller areas of the market are inefficient, there are considerable risks. You are usually investing in second rate businesses that destroy value, or at least are not really building any. Often these businesses are run by inexperienced managers and have little advantage over their competitors. Thus, the business risks you assume are big ones, although most investors think a cheap valuation makes up for it. Sometimes, but not always.  Take for an example Dempster Mill Mftg  a well known Buffett investment way back when. If you think through the situation, there was a good probability that the investment was not a wise one. It took heroic efforts by a new manager to keep Dempster from going under, and even then, it was not an absolute home run. Yet, most Buffetteers admire these types of investments Warren used to make.  But what was Warrens largest partnership investment? American Express, a well known company then and now, not a micro-cap dishwasher manufacturer. He also had a successful investment in Disney, and one in GEICO, again two companies that were well known. What was probably his best stock investment at Berkshire? The Washington Post, not exactly unknown.  Yet were told that he made all of his great returns back then because he could look small. Well, as with everything in life, the answer is yes and no. I think there is a great myth that you need to look where no-one else is looking and be creative in the investment process. That you should get points for creativity or something. But the very same people propagating this myth are students of Charlie Munger, who once wrote to Wesco shareholders that We try to profit more from always remembering the obvious then grasping the esoteric.  Lets talk about a few more of Warrens home runs. Petrochina, one of the largest companies on the planet. Freddie Mac, one of the largest companies on the planet. Coca-Cola, the most well-known brand on the planet. BYD, one of Chinas most well-known and well-respected companies. These are investments where, for the first 5-10 years, he made 25%+ compound annual returns. Who are these people not getting rich by consistently generating 25% compound returns? Where is this stock market where 25% annual returns dont generate alpha? Why do small investors need to run around looking at micro-caps?  ***  Lets also look at some other legendary investors. What sort of returns did they achieve and what were they buying? Lou Simpson  20%+ type returns buying very well known companies. Rick Guerin  25% type returns investing in a pretty broad range of securities small and large. Ruane, Cunniff  15% over 40 years investing in large stocks. Eddie Lampert at ESL  you would probably know of almost every company he ever invested in  30% CAGR for a 15-20 year period. Glenn Greenberg at Chieftain  did 25% for about 20 years, again youd probably recognize almost every stock he owned.  These guys are legends, theyre all rich, and they invested in a huge range of securities.  Who do we know of that was investing in small securities that no one has heard of? Heres two: Schloss and Graham. Did either of them do 50% compounded? Hell no. Theyre hall-of-famers with 15-20% returns. Do I need to bring up Charlies returns? What has he bought over time?  So I dispute this notion that investors are somehow doing themselves a disservice by sticking with companies they know well and that others know well. Well-known companies are often just as mispriced as small ones. To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail, says Munger. Yet the Buffetteers seem to only admire one tool for finding cheap stocks (size constraints), when myopia, ignorance, and a host of other biases are just as powerful in creating misvalued securities.  To wrap this up a little, Im not saying there arent lots of small mispriced stocks. Buffett did very well with them, and there are probably others doing great, too. But recognize two things: 1. Huge CAGRs are really, really hard. 2. You can do extremely well investing in larger companies, great companies, and well-known companies, without a lot of the risks of investing in broken-down nags. This is well proven.  So if you rationally evaluate Fairfax and come to the conclusion that youre going to get 15-20%+ CAGR (eminently reasonable given the fact that they are a relatively small player in a gigantic global insurance market and are run by one of the smarter investment teams on the planet), dont worry about how much alpha youre not generating by looking elsewhere. Was it a mistake to invest in Berkshire when it had a billion dollar market cap and was well known? I repeat, there are no points for creativity. Dont forget it takes a unique cast of mind to just sit on some great companies and compound at high rates with no taxes, professional investor or not.  Im probably not going to convert anyone who believes strongly that they have to be looking in the dirty alleys for cheap stocks, but if youre on the fence, hopefully this is food for thought. \",\n",

Listen i'm not stating all jews agree, i've seen and been involved passively in many arguments over how jewish is defined, it's fine if you disagree i'm not trying to put you in a box i'm just going by how i've seen it and how my jewish friends explain it to me which is this:  Jewish is the ethnicity/culture you can be born into and are still apart of even if you leave Judaism the religion. Theirs a notable difference.  Like i said if you don't see yourself as Jewish, that's perfectly fine, your not the first of your ilk to define yourself apart from the religion and culture and you want be the last. Rachel dolezal decided to stop being white, i can stop being black_ racist. lol except if you're a muslim then you could be killed for it but i digress. Either-way not saying people can choose new ethnic backgrounds, what i'm stating is for the majority even if you choose to no longer follow Judaism under jewish law you're still considered jewish.  Karl marx converted to Christianity from Judaism he was still considered Jewish, Trotsky refused to consider himself a jew even to the detriment of jewish people, when a rabbi pleaded for his assistance he refused stating in communism their is no religion. Yet he never attained any higher status in the party because stalin refused to allow a jew into a higher position despite the fact he did not self identify or even recognize himself as a jew or having anything to do with being jewish.  Like i said before you can refuse, you can assimilate, you can be that white dude from Philadelphia but theirs always going to be somebody who will state you're still a jew. That's why it's an ethnic background, i can't stop being black, i can refuse to acknowledge my black identity, cultural identity and stereotypical norms associated with being black in america but guess what i'm still black.  I can understand hating the idea of something forced upon you but theirs certain things we cannot change, you're not a jew according to you, that's great but i don't think that gives you a right to declare it's not a ethnic identity because you don't want to relate to it.    \",\n",

       "  'text': ' Study: [Human-induced greening of the northern extratropical land surface](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate3056.html)  **Abstract**:  *Significant land greening in the northern extratropical latitudes (NEL) has been documented through satellite observations during the past three decades. This enhanced vegetation growth has broad implications for surface energy, water and carbon budgets, and ecosystem services across multiple scales. Discernible human impacts on the Earths climate system have been revealed by using statistical frameworks of detectionattribution. These impacts, however, were not previously identified on the NEL greening signal, owing to the lack of long-term observational records, possible bias of satellite data, different algorithms used to calculate vegetation greenness, and the lack of suitable simulations from coupled Earth system models (ESMs). Here we have overcome these challenges to attribute recent changes in NEL vegetation activity. We used two 30-year-long remote-sensing-based leaf area index (LAI) data sets, simulations from 19 coupled ESMs with interactive vegetation, and a formal detection and attribution algorithm. Our findings reveal that the observed greening record is consistent with an assumption of anthropogenic forcings, where greenhouse gases play a dominant role, but is not consistent with simulations that include only natural forcings and internal climate variability. These results provide the first clear evidence of a discernible human fingerprint on physiological vegetation changes other than phenology and range shifts.* ',\n",

In some places there are parish councils that deal with micro issues.   If the issue was larger, I'd go to my MP at his surgery - he's a feckless idiot though - which means a petition is probably the best thing. Some schools exist outside of the control of the local authority, in which case I'd have to contact the national government minister for education directly. Some issues pertaining, for example to regulations can only be sorted out at a supranational level so I spose Id have to go to my MEP (whose name I don't even know).    \",\n",

       "  'text': \" Hi all, first time here.   Just a little background: 8 years ago, we had a builder renovate our basement; the plans included a home theater. The alcove is about 20' by 25' and is not entirely enclosed (hence alcove). We got a Bose HTIB installed (Lifestyle 28, series II - if anyone's curious). About 2 years ago, the home theater fell into disuse because of a lack of HD capability from the Bose system. We had been using a WD TV Live starting around the time the home theater started being less useful.   What we need:    - we have a Sony projector (8 years old) with HDMI, component video, and VGA ports.   - we have a bar which has an old (~4 years old) LCD tv using a coaxial connection with the satellite box. The wire goes through the wall and was put there by the builder.   - we recently got a tv for a treadmill. We use a 35 feet HDMI cable to connect the satellite box directly to the tv.   Other considerations:   - the front left, right, and center cube speakers from the Bose system sit on a AV cabinet/stand about 2' high. meanwhile, the rear left and right cube speakers are mounted on a wall.   tl;dr: We want an AV receiver that can connect our satellite box, dvd player, Wii, and WD TV Live (as well as any other HDMI capable device) to our projector, treadmill tv, and bar tv. Also, we need to find a sound system that is versatile to fit an irregular-shaped room.   Any recommendations? \",\n",

Puff, pretty much the same except with some higher knock back on some moves making her combo game much weirder to pull off if ever.  Melee top tiers are not immune to nerfs. But they're designs are bound to their Melee playstyle.  I really think that what PMDT is trying to do is use the Melee top tiers as a guidelines. If PNDT thinks all characters can be as good as Fox and Falco, then at least they should be worth a try. Heck, Hungry Box is even playing puff again. Wiz robe still plays sonic. PK Fire in shield was removed and PK flash doesn't seem to have the same power, but NZA (I take it from him since he's the best Ness I've seen) thinks Ness has actually improved overall.  Just because a character is needed one way does not mean that they are worse. All changes to a character should be taken into account. Everyone can basically live longer against Melee top tiers despite their needed recoveries. \",\n",

       "  'text': \" This is mainly my way of expressing pain, however I would like a few suggestions.  I don't know if I'm a perfectionist or juts... a bad writer.  Just a brief background about myself: I'm 16, and English isn't my native language. I began writing last year on a novel I had in mind. I've spend hours researching about the topic and elements I could use that will make it better. I really wanted to write, and I became obsessive about it.  I could see this story so clearly in my mind, but I couldn't put it to paper. I gave up after a few months.  On April I began writing another story of Fantasy, I've reached 14k words and it seems as an incredible achievement. I was really delightful and I thought I was on track of achieving it. I could already imagine myself as a writer, and finally achievement something I wanted to do.   Writing a novel wasn't just writing a short-story I could exhibit to my parents.   Today I finally reviewed my story and discovered that I'm stuck. Again. No matter how much I rewrite, it doesn't come out well. I don't know if I'm a perfectionist or juts... a bad writer.   I tried every possible way of becoming more creative. Some of those ways contained smoking/taking something, but it didn't last forever. I don't want to be drugged in order to become a writer, but even that didn't seem to help.  Any tips/suggestions? Thanks, Daniel  TL;DR: I have a terrible writer's block that lasts forever. Should I quit writing? \",\n",

So, does it deliver? In a word: Yes.  Legendary Pictures\\' Godzilla origin story carries the weight of unwieldy expectations, but rather than buckle, it is ultimately a fantastic - though imperfect - example of the genre. Gareth Edwards both depicts what is beloved about this magnificent creature and creates a film that is distinctly its own entity, one that brings Godzilla to gorgeous new life. The Easter Eggs and nods to previous versions and additional suitmation favorites will likely be appreciated by sharp-eyed aficionados. If Edwards installment serves as your introduction to the King of the Monsters, though, theres plenty for you to enjoy as well.\"  ',\n",

Once the U.S. renounces its self-proclaimed entitlement to superstate violence, it may have a chance at redeeming some credibility, and if it works really hard, trust. One opportunity here that has not been looked at is the political opening offered by the new President of Iran, Rouhani, who has denounced the use of chemical weapons, although he does not blame Assad for their use. Let the scientists look at the evidence, and confirm Assad's role.  Let Iran know that it is not the object of encirclement, in preparation for an attack.  They have a legitimate interest in protecting the Alawite population of Syria from jihadi annihilation.  But that does not mean they need Assad in power. A move towards recognizing Iran's long-term defensive needs is a prerequisite for peace in a post-Assad Syria. Give peace a chance. \",\n",

I'm not arguing to keep nestle open, i'm saying that the entire practice is unaffordable, unsustainable, and breaking down.  desal can certainly provide the raw materials (solar, waves, wind, geothermal, etc can provide the energy needed for heat... desalination, reverse osmosis, etc... )  but at what cost? and, more so... why do that that way only to continue to waste it due to inefficiency on the back end?  25%+ of the water that goes to the ag industry in california is lost due to irrigative evaporation.   promote various methods that change irrigation practices, punish those who don't, and right off the bat there'll be more savings to justify *not* building so many desal plants.  california doesn't 'need' desal. it needs a change in infrastructural   managerial approach \",\n",

He starts worrying that the corpse is alive, and that it's sitting up and looking at him, but he won't open his eyes to check.

For an automatic transmission to work you need a few additional parts that simply introduce added inefficiencies (due to friction and energy requirements) and extra weight. Even though newer transmissions lessened these effects significantly, they haven't been eliminated - and probably won't be.  That said, the electronics in the automatic transmission allow optimisations in many ways. The gear changes, for instance, only happen in the optimal rpm-range thus lowering the fuel consumption. In (some) modern cars the latter effect is bigger than the former allowing cars with automatic transmission to have greater gas mileage.  Still, in every manual car the effect of the driver's habits is far greater. These standardized tests might not be the way to go if you really want to judge what would work best for you. \",\n",

Both Goodfellas and Casino, and now Wolf of Wall Street, show off what I think Scorsese is best at, showing us a crazy stylized alluring at first, but ultimately corrupt and doomed, fast paced get-rich-quick type scenario, that gradually falls apart as we see more of the horrible things that happen as a consequence, and how money and power corrupt the characters.  Scorsese is great at taking the classic rise and fall, American dream type movie, showing it in a twisted and corrupt light, and cranking everything up to eleven. Boogie Nights is so clearly aiming for the exact same motif, just in the porn world instead of the gangster world. PTA totally understood and reinterpreted and nailed everything Scorsese was going for.  American Hustle felt like it was trying for a similar vibe but just did not hit the mark.  Everything in Boogie Nights, the shots, the scenes, the characters, the cinematography, the pacing, the music, even the way the camera moves, is all dripping with Scorsese's influence. It totally feels like a twisted alternate-porn version of Goodfellas and I love the hell out of it. \",\n",

       "  'text': \" Just got back from a special screening that AMC did where they sent me two free tickets. First I will say that right before the movie began, I checked the ratings and saw it was at 54% on RT. Disappointing so my hopes were not high.  But that movie was amazing. The raw emotion that Jake showed was extremely intense the entire film. This was not a movie about boxing, it was a movie about an emotional journey of a man.  As the trailer spoils, Rachel McAdams dies. This happens pretty early in the film and the rest is a semi-poorly written script on his downward spiral and redemption. While I was not a fan of the writing, Rachel and Jake both shined bright.  If you've been watching the new True Detective season, you've seen a side of Rachel McAdams that she hasn't shown before. This is another. Rachel's character is an extremely realistic, semi-trashy girl who plays the part perfectly. When she shrugs when Jake looks at her in between rounds in the first match, it portrays a girl who grew up with Jake's character and does not love, but lives with his career out of necessity. She never celebrates the huge money but clearly enjoys it, nearly to a fault. The way she played the character was perfect for the background they gave.  As for Jake, it was a brilliant performance. The way he acted in Rachel's death scene was perfect. While the death itself was not particularly realistic, Rachel's reaction and the way Jake held her and talked to her was more realistic than I've ever seen in any movie. It showed the pure fear he had for losing someone he'd grown up with. It showed how much he depended on her. It made me shed a few tears.  Jake's character was played as a hyper-emotional, dumb kid, who grew up in the foster system. He nailed it at every turn. Meeting his new boxing trainer, perfect. Frustration with his comeback, perfect. Dealing with his daughter in uncharted territory, perfect. He truly got into this character's head and the dedication to his work was evident. He lived and breathed this character every second of the film.  This was a character that Jake had never played before. While I thought his worst performance was Source Code, where he didn't show much at all, he added another masterful performance to his collection here. Between Nightcrawler, Enemy, Prisoners, End of Watch, Zodiac, Jarhead, Brokeback Mountain, Bubble Boy, Donnie Darko, October Sky, and now Southpaw, Jake Gyllenhaal is truly one of the most versatile actors of our generation. It is truly a pleasure to see him perform- especially when we have actors who play basically the same character at every turn (Michael Cera, Liam Neeson, Kevin Hart, Melissa McCarthy, etc.).  My biggest gripe in the movie was probably that he literally was a southpaw fighter for one second of the entire film, and the lone reference to being a southpaw was of no significance whatsoever. But if you're not a big fight fan, you likely wouldn't notice that anyway.  If I could rate a movie just on the raw performance of the lead actor, I'd give it a 10/10. Unfortunately the writing was weak and some of the secondary characters were weak/underdeveloped (the random extra death, 50 Cent's performance and Forest Whitaker to an extent), so I'll give the movie an overall 6.5/10. \",\n",

       "  'text': ' #[Thailand](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2kduka/it_found_me_in_thailand/) #Home #[Calling](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2klvr6/it_found_me_in_thailand_part_3/)  It always feels weird to go home. Surreal, like somehow walking into someone else\\'s life; it\\'s not mine anymore. The scenery changes very little over the years in small towns, but the things that happen there no longer concern me. My stresses and routines exist somewhere else while these ones have gone cold like the still air in the empty bedroom in my parent\\'s house.  Mom was happy to see me. It had been over a year since I\\'d visited her, and she\\'d aged years in that time. Her hair was shorter, and flatter, and she had new glasses whose thick, brown frames made her face seem even thinner.  I couldn\\'t tell her everything. It was just too weird, and my thoughts were too disorganized. I told her that Mark was missing, and I was expecting the police or someone to come looking for me in the morning. I talked for a little while about the rest of my time in Thailand, and then shut myself in my room. I fell onto my old bed, and was asleep.  I\\'m having weird dreams every night now. In them, I\\'ll go places and talk to people like I would if I were awake. There are usually just bits and pieces - tall shelves, faceless men in suits and a few times now I\\'ve dreamed of the red tree. They feel like dreams the next day... but sometimes while they\\'re going on, I\\'m afraid that I might wake up, standing in the middle of that shop in Thailand, Alan smiling at me with broken teeth, and empty eyes like Mark\\'s mask.  I woke up at midnight. After tossing and turning, I gave up the fight to keep my eyes closed. I checked reddit on my phone while laying draped over the edge of my old bed. Damn, some of you seem to have it even worse than I do. Others of your stories are eerily similar. Out of curiosity, I decided to search for the post I\\'d found before, \"All In Good Time.\"  Everything was almost exactly the same except for two things: the score was much higher and it had more comments than it had the first time. The second thing that had changed was the address. Instead of Pattaya, Thailand, it now had the name of my home town in Oregon. Google Maps pointed to a place about a mile and a half from my house.  I was tempted to go there. *Drawn.* Something pulled at the strings inside my head, puppeting my hands as I got dressed and laced my shoes. Just before I reached the front door, I stopped and stood for a full minute in my mom\\'s living room. Just to see if I could.  This wasn\\'t a dream. I wasn\\'t sleepwalking. I wasn\\'t possessed. I just... needed to know.  Out the front door, I pulled my hoodie tighter around my shoulders against the cold and stuffed my hands deeper into my pockets. It was colder here than Thailand had been, especially in the middle of the night. In high school I used to walk like this all the time, just setting out without a place to go. I planned on going near the store, but not inside. I wanted to see it, but for now... I was just walking.  As I reached the more populated areas, I passed more people out on the street. I skirted the lights and hoped that no one would try to talk to me and kept up a pretty fast pace.  I reached the place on the map where it had said the store would be. It was in the middle of a strip of little shops - book stores, antiques, boutique clothes. At first glance, I wasn\\'t sure it was the place. It was conspicuously empty and barren. A white sign with red lettering read \"For Sale\" on the largest window. On my toes, I was just able to see through the windows to the shadowy empty shelves inside.  \"There you are,\" said a voice behind me. I spun and saw a man leaning out the window of an impeccable white convertible Mustang. The car hadn\\'t made a sound before, but now the engine was chugging in a low growl. It was the shop owner from Thailand still wearing the same suit that I\\'d seen him in before. His crooked teeth were on display through a thin-lipped smile. He looked slightly deranged. \"I was hoping I\\'d find you here. It seems to me like you\\'ve got something I want. Two somethings, actually.\" He licked his lips as he looked me up and down.  \"Fuck off!\" I screamed as I kicked his car with a muddy sneaker.  Faster than I could react, he was out of the car and coming toward me. With surprising strength, he shoved me against the window behind me.  \"Listen, you little bitch. You made a deal,\" He growled like an animal. Every word was punctuated with pain. He seemed to be all elbows beneath his jacket. Insanely, my biggest fear in that moment was that he would bite or claw me. He was panting, and his hot breath smelled strongly of stale tobacco.  Then his smile returned. He released me from the wall and took a step back, straightening his tie and jacket.  \"Tomorrow night, before the sun rises, I expect to have the watch delivered to me. I\\'ll warn you though, I don\\'t give extensions easily, miss.\"  So that was it. He was after the pocket watch.  He ducked back into the ghostly white Mustang and slowly rolled down the street and out of sight.  My heart was nearly beating a hole through my chest. I pulled myself up from where I\\'d collapsed on the sidewalk and ran until I saw perhaps the only place still open in town that late at night. With no one in sight, I leaned against the wall and caught my breath before turning the corner and entering Rustic Sports Bar.  \"Hi, we close in an hour!\" shouted the woman from the behind the bar.  I told her that was fine and ordered a drink, downed it and ordered another. The noise and movement of the games replaying on the televisions was calming, though I wished that more people were there. I was afraid to go back outside.  After another drink and a few more commercial breaks, someone came up behind me.  \"Hey I know you, don\\'t I?\" said a male voice.  It was some guy who I recognized him from high school. His name was Ben. He was a couple years older than me and we\\'d hever hung out, but was really well-known for being the school\\'s star basketball player. I\\'d heard a lot of rumors of teachers being forced to give him extra credit and turning D\\'s to B\\'s to keep him on the team. There was pressure to keep him playing, but there was more pressure from his wealthy and well-connected father.  I guess the rumors had been true, since after he\\'d gone to play at a Division 1 school on a scholarship, he\\'d failed out after the first semester because of his grades. He looked like he spent more time in the bar than on the basketball court these days.  He was obnoxious and drunk, but talking to someone eased my nerves. When the bar closed, I convinced him to give me a ride back home. I dodged his clumsy attempt to kiss me and tried to ignore his creeping hands. It took him a while for him to understand that he wasn\\'t invited inside. The tires of his too-expensive car squealed as he took off down the street.  ---  I was seven when my mom finally left my dad. The fight before the split dragged on all night. I guess that they\\'d each just had enough, and threw everything they had at each other. A few months later, he passed away and at his funeral, my uncle had said that it was because of a broken heart. Even at seven I\\'d known that he\\'d never had one to begin with.  Anyway, I remember packing my toys on the day that we left. I was a serious tomboy at that age, and didn\\'t own even a single pink thing. All my toys were the cool boy toys of the 90\\'s. I carefully appraised each one before putting it into the blue Jansport backpack I used for school. They wouldn\\'t all fit, and I had to take apart my Legos to pack them down better. I worried that she\\'d make me leave them when I came out of my room, backpack full and carrying Stretch Armstrong and Buzz Lightyear in my arms. She didn\\'t say anything though. She just packed some pictures and our clothes into a couple suitcases and then we got into her car and went to grandma\\'s.  I stayed with grandma for a long time before mom came back. I don\\'t think that she had a place to stay, so she left me there where I\\'d be safe. I hadn\\'t really minded, since grandma\\'s house was amazing. I missed the last month or so of school, and then it was summer.   I played outside every minute of the day, and whenever I came inside with grass stains on my knees and scrapes on my elbows, grandma would tell me how that was \"just the way it should be,\" then she\\'d make me open-faced peanut butter and jelly sandwiches that were somehow sweeter and more delicious than the kind anyone else made.  The forest behind her house seemed huge. There were a few miles of hiking trails that no one owned or ever used that fed down from the main road along the top of the hill to the big lake at the bottom. Gradually, like entropy, the toys I\\'d brought in my backpack got spread out to all my favorite spots in the woods. Stretch Armstrong died in a tree-climbing accident when his rubbery legs got caught on a broken branch. He bled sticky corn syrup all over the pine needles and my hands and he slowly deflated.  I knew that there was no way to bring him back, so instead I reasoned that a fitting memorial would be to tie him at the very highest point of the tree, where his plastic smiling face could look out over the woods and the lake forever. He\\'d be the one in the crow\\'s nest whenever I played pirates on the ground.  The tree wobbled as I climbed it. I was a skinny kid, but the tree was thinner, and it bent precariously. I quickly tied his arms and legs in double granny knots and raised him into his final resting place, then I looked out where his blank eyes were looking.  Straight ahead, not far away, reflections of clouds were swimming in the still blue lake. Going west would take me back to grandma\\'s house, and to the east was more forest, and fewer houses until you went all the way out to the Boy Scout camp. From our perch, Armstrong and I could see their dock poking out from the shore. Just past that, something red caught my eye.  I double checked Stretch - he looked happy in his final resting place - then climbed down, found my best stick-sword and headed off toward the lake. My imagination was always in overdrive then, but now there was something real to investigate. I thought about what I\\'d do if it were a hot air balloon whose pilot needed my help to get back into the air. I shuddered to think what if it were a UFO?  I hugged the shoreline, moving quick to keep my feet from sinking in the soft sand. I passed a forked tree, the base of which held three of my power rangers, waiting for Zordon\\'s call for their next adventure.   You had to be careful going into the Boy Scout\\'s territory, and normally I never played in there. Girls weren\\'t allowed. If an adult found you, they could have you \"thrown out\" according to my grandma. I knew that she meant that someone\\'s dad would call and have you picked up, but I\\'d always imagined a band of scouts tying me up with chains and padlocks and tossing me off the end of the dock.  Thankfully no one was there this time. I didn\\'t need to, but snuck through the campground like Mission Impossible anyway, eyes wide and ears open for any sound. Everything was completely silent. Strangely so.  I\\'d imagined a hundred things that the red spot I\\'d seen from the crow\\'s nest could be. The logical side of my brain had even considered a piece of garbage, or the Boy Scouts\\' misplaced canoe. The only thing I hadn\\'t allowed myself to consider was that it was just another tree.  Most of the trees in the forest were the kind with needles. In fact, the only trees I saw with leaves were the apple trees my grandma had planted in front of her house. As I came up on the curious red tree with five-pointed maple leaves, I wondered if maybe this tree had been planted too. Nothing else was growing for 30 or 40 feet in every direction around it. Each one of its leaves glowed bright, deep red like cranberry juice.  I snuck forward, casting one last look back to the empty camp, and the direction of grandma\\'s house. It was starting to get that cool feeling that you get at the end of the day. I\\'d have to start back soon, or race the sun for its remaining light.   I stepped into the circle of dead around the tree, and a weird, irritating sensation washed over me. The evening air was no longer cold. Actually, it felt like heat was emanating straight up out of the ground. There was a smell with it too, like must and decomposition. I had the strong feeling that I was some place I shouldn\\'t have been, like I had entered some kind of memorial or grave that I shouldn\\'t have been treading on.  So I left. After sneaking through the camp and the woods, I got back to grandma\\'s just as it was getting dark, sat at the table until I cleaned my plate, and forgot the whole thing.  Days came and went without a care or a thing to do. I started to feel like my time at grandma\\'s would just go on forever. That was the life. I hoped that nothing would ever change.  But change came knocking on the front door as I was getting ready for bed. I was brushing my teeth in the downstairs bathroom, pajamas already on and eyelids heavy.  The knocking came, but it sounded more like someone was kicking the door. I heard my father\\'s voice. Even through the thick, wooden frame, it echoed through the house. He was calling my name, and calling grandma something else.  Grandma rushed downstairs to get me, and whisked me up into the attic through a set of trapdoor stairs. She took something that looked like a briefcase with a lock on it, except it was almost as long as she was tall, then she kissed the top of my head and went back down the stairs, closing the trapdoor behind her.  I crawled over the insulation, and looked out through the window with one eye. I could see my father\\'s truck, but one side of the hood had been dented in. The bed looked like it was full of cans and bottles. I could still hear him screaming, but it didn\\'t sound like he was at the front door anymore.   I heard a crash downstairs, like a window breaking and then a bang that shook the walls and made me cover my ears. My father and my grandma were screaming worse than when mom and he had fought, then grandma went quiet.  There was a latch on the attic window, which pushed open and let me out onto the roof. From there I dropped down onto the garage like dropping out of a tree. I tried to climb down the rain gutter from the garage to the ground, but it wasn\\'t fastened. With a screech and moan of twisting hollow metal, I dropped onto the damp ground and ran barefoot into the woods. A minute later, I could hear my father calling my name.  I didn\\'t care. My fear gave me wings carried me away.  I had hiding spots. These were *my* woods, after all. If I\\'d wanted to, I could have hidden all night. To this day, I still don\\'t know why I didn\\'t do exactly that, but before I\\'d started running, even before I\\'d unlatched the window and gone outside, I\\'d known that I was going back to the red tree.  My father bounded loudly through the brush like a mindless hulk behind me. I moved quietly along the edge of the lake, like I\\'d done a thousand times before.  There were lights on at the Boy Scout camp. I could have run there for help, waking them in their cabins, but something about the tree was calling me just a little further ahead. My father had stopped yelling, and had cleared the trees and underbrush. I didn\\'t know where he was.  I saw the tree for a second - bared of all its leaves, its trunk now bleached white, before the ground dropped out from beneath my feet. The whole dead circle around the tree had sunken several feet, and was now filled with rainwater. Shed bark and leaves covered the surface like tissue paper and shattered black ice. The water was warm, almost hot. I broke the surface and swam the best I could toward its bone white trunk, like a marble statue of a graceful hand reaching out of the muck.  \"Allie!\" my father called from behind me, teetering on the edge of the circle, holding a rifle. \"I\\'m not gonna tell you again, Allie, get out of there, right now.\"  My fingers closed around the trunk of the tree. It was so slick. I\\'d climbed trees every day for the past two months, and even had a growth spurt, but there was no way to climb that tree.  My stomach fell. Despite all my imagination, I hadn\\'t thought of what to do now that I\\'d made it there. I had failed. I gripped the branches and shook them in frustration. What had I thought was going to happen?  \"You\\'re going to make me do this, girl. You and and that damned mother of yours.\"  He had the rifle up at his shoulder, eye in the sights and finger on the trigger. I ducked sideways, sinking back under the water. Instead of a gunshot, there was silence like I\\'d gone deaf. Lights played across my closed eyelids. I felt the water swirling around me, throwing me limply around, and stretching me like thin rubber filled with corn syrup.  Then... it was over. I was sitting at the top of the white maple, my legs dangling below. The place that my father had been standing just a moment ago was illuminated by the headlights of a police cruiser. They were so afraid at first that I\\'d been shot. The water, dyed red by the fallen leaves had soaked me like blood.  In my hand, I found a tiny pocketwatch. The inside isn\\'t a mermaid in the water... it\\'s me.  Eventually - unbelieveably - I forgot... I forgot about the tree. I forgot how my father had disappeared. I forgot everything until it found me again in Thailand.  I don\\'t know why it chose that place or that time, or why it waited so long to find me, but now it has. It found me in Thailand, but I think somehow that it\\'s never been far away... and it will be waiting for me when I get back home.  It\\'s waited all this time, and now it\\'s coming for me.  ',\n",

       "  'text': \" I'll be honest, I don't know if this can be a breakfest and dinner type scenario, or if there is more to it. I've tried looking at the getting started section, but it's incredibly overwhelming for someone who doesn't really keep up with weight, what is in his food, his daily intake etc.  That being said, I've seen it mentioned a few times among groups I talk to, that a person or two is only eating chicken and rice for whatever amount of time.  Is this a good idea? A bad idea? Of course it's boring, but I feel it may also take a whole lot of bad stuff away from your day to day eating, along with the chicken bringing in protein.  Like I said, this is the first time in my life that I'm paying attention to my weight, the ingredients in my food, and just general healthiness, so tips would be great. Thanks.  EDIT: Also, I'm guessing it's one of the cheapest diets out there, considering you can pick up 6-8 fillets for like 5 euro in some butchers.   EDIT 2: Would it make sense to add some kind of powdered shake into the mix for gain? I understand what I'm looking for here is weight loss, but it's more about dropping the wasteful weight, and turning what I had into muscle.  \",\n",

Sean Murray (the head developer) put his heart and soul into this project. It\\'s completely different from any other space sim - ED, Start Citizen, they\\'re both \"realistic\", while NMS takes from the SciFi Pop culture - hence, the weird-ass aliens, the fancy colors etc. I was on the fence because I thought there was only one Space Sim in my life and that was Elite - but I know know I\\'ll play NMS (played it on PS4, waiting for 6pm today for PC version :)).  Long story short: maybe it\\'s not a 60 bucks AAA title on release, and if you can wait / don\\'t want to spend that money, wait for a sale.

Until that moment he thought it was something he had not done in time and the charge was automatic. He then lost his job, spent time in jail and in that period of time accrued about 15,000 dollars in debt because of non payment, late fees and court costs all while he was in jail. She just wanted more money thinking just the threat of a felony would make him give her more money but once she pushed for it it became official and he went into the system. The woman who pointed that out even told the woman she went to far and now hes a felon and she's going to get a lot less money, see she was even trying to go after his unemployment. \",\n",

I enjoyed Bioshock: Infinite, its weaker parts are better than many other games' good parts - but I think the game doesn't work as a complete experience in the way TLoU does.  B:I has nowhere near as much tension, and so doesn't pull you in or make you care to succeed / survive to the extent TLoU does.  Often during B:I I felt like I was wondering around a deserted museum. A museum filled with glimpses of the game that could have been, and I suspect a game that was diminished so it could be coded for current-gen consoles (e.g. the difference between the final game and the initial [years old trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajCiS0_ssLE) which still to me has more tension than the acutal game).  I felt I played all the game that Naughty Dog wanted to make and I would have played hours more of it.  I was glad to reach the end of B:I and kinda finished it just to see the end for myself - I was ready to finish the game hours earlier.    \",\n",

The only evidence out right now, from both crooked Nunes and from the SIC and FBI, is that the Trump campaign was incidentally caught up in legal surveillance.  If you speak to a Russian ambassador, expect your call to be tapped.  If the call has national security implications, it\\'s perfectly legal for them to \"unmask\" the American\\'s name on the other end.  When you\\'re under investigation by the FBI\\'s counterintelligence teams, the unmasking of your name in communications with foreign agents is legal, routine, and expected.  Unless you have proof they collected his communications directly, not incidentally, and that Susan Rice personally leaked the information to the media, you are being willfully misled.   I know you don\\'t want to believe Trump can do anything bad, but that shouldn\\'t shape your understanding of reality. ',\n",

People think I am a \"cool\" dude because I look somewhat good and I do artsy stuff especially poetry. I also run fast and I am somewhat fit but not muscular.

TLDR: Call the suicide hotline for depression counseling. They are also there to help people whose loved ones have depression.  \",\n",

I was delivering some packages, and went to turn around on my heel, a motion I have made thousands of times around here. The only difference? I somehow twisted wrong, and my knee explodes into an instant ten on the pain scale. I couldn't move, nor could I call out. My coworkers don't know I have these knee problems, and letting them know would be bad, as it's only my fifth week on this job. After a few minutes, the pain subsided to an easy seven, but has remained there since. This happened about an hour ago, and every time I go to turn, instant ten again. I just don't know what to do, I'm hoping someone can help? Maybe a couple of pointers, other than not turning on that leg?

I usually just use either a compression brace, or a full on DonJoy knee brace, depending on the pain level. However, there are many days I can go without one. But on bad days, I can't really seem to cope with it. I get really irritable, and my closest friends and family can't really seem to be near me. The only one who has been able to stay by me is the wonderful woman I'm dating. She always seems to know what to say or do. My biggest recommendation is to find a good brace, and an even better support system. Because otherwise, at least in my opinion, the pain may just over take you.   Also, lots of ibuprofen. Always a big help when it comes to inflammation, or any sort of pain. Hope this helped you!! You are not alone!!  \",\n",

       "  'text': ' I need some fellow knitters\\' awesome advice and help please - I started knitting the Sweet Life mittens I found on Ravelry a little while ago. Having never done a gusset in my life before (I\\'ve only been knitting scarves and hats), I\\'m having trouble trying to decode this pattern. Here is the original pattern for the left hand gusset that the author wrote (keep in mind the patterned part is only on the top, there is ribbing underneath, and I\\'m knitting in the round):  Left Mitt Gusset Knit in pattern to last 2 K sts, move marker to this spot. Increase two sts between the final 2 sts by picking up the stitch below and knitting into the front and back of that stitch. Knit in pattern for two rounds. At the third round continue pattern, Slip marker. Kfb the next stitch, knit across gusset and kfb the last stitch in the round. You will continue in this manner, increasing 2 sts every third round, until you have 12sts in your gusset. Knit one round in pattern. At the end of the round remove the gusset sts to waste yarn. In the space left by the gusset sts, CO 6 sts. Knit 2 rounds in pattern. On the third round K2tog after Marker and again for the last two sts in round. Continue in this manner decreasing 2 stitches every third row until you are back to the original (36, 48) stitch count. Knit in pattern until 7.5 inches long.  So I have attempted to write this in an easier form for myself, row by row. Here is the majority of my attempt:  left gusset pattern written out: 1: repeat #2, last two knit stitches in pattern, move marker HERE. increase between next two stitches 2 stitches by m1 and kfb that stitch 2: repeat #3 3: repeat #4, after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 4: repeat #5 5: repeat #6 6: repeat #7, after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 7: repeat #8 8: repeat #9 9: repeat #10, after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 10: repeat #11 11: repeat #12 12: repeat #1 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 13: repeat #2  14: repeat #3 15: repeat #4 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 16: repeat #5 17: repeat #6 18: repeat #7 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 19: repeat #8  20: repeat #9 21: repeat #10 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 22: repeat #11 24: repeat #12 25: repeat #1 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 26: repeat #2 27: repeat #3 28: repeat #4 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 29: repeat #5 30: repeat #6 31: repeat #7 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round 32: repeat #8, slip gusset sts on waste yarn and cast on 6 sts in empty space 33: repeat #9 34: repeat #10 35: repeat #11, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round 36: repeat #12 37: repeat #1 38: repeat #2, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round 39: repeat #3 40: repeat #4 41: repeat #5, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round 42: repeat #6 43: repeat #7 44: repeat #8, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round 45: repeat #9 46: repeat #10 47: repeat #11, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round 48: repeat #12 49: repeat #1 50: repeat #2, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round  I have no idea if I\\'m doing this right. If any of you more experienced knitters could help me out on this, I would greatly appreciate your expertise! Also if you spot anything else in my \"redone\" pattern that looks a little wrong, feel free to let me know. It just seems like the whole gusset and actual body of the mitten would be so unproportional (lol is that a word even?)  Here is a link to the Sweet Life pattern: http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/sweet-life A link to my project page (has my improvised pattern in the notes): http://www.ravelry.com/projects/test_subject380597/sweet-life  Thank you thank you thank you!!!

There's something about growing one year. Getting further and further into schoolwork that you don't want to do, so you'll go to a school you where you wont fit in, so you can have a job that you will hate. It doesn't help that almost every friend that I wanted to notice me today wouldn't give one less of a shit about me. I hate birthdays.  edit: Thank you all for the kind words \",\n",

But I recently came across this sourdough recipe. http://www.reformationacres.com/2010/12/whole-wheat-sourdough-sandwich-bread.html but I cut out the brown sugar because I wanted the sourdough flavor to be stronger.  1 ounce of the bread is about 70 calories I believe.   I also recently made a banana cashew chocolate bread. I can't seem to find it right now. But basically take your favorite banana bread recipe and add a handful of chocolate chips to the mix. Then spoon half the batter into pan. Mix cashew butter with a bit of oil to thin it out, and pour over batter. Pour rest of batter into pan and use knife to swirl the butter throughout the batter. So yummy.  \",\n",

For the smoothie I used it undiluted,  with frozen bananas, Greek yogurt and chocolate protein powder. Bit higher calorie, but filling. I had borrowed the protein powder from a friend, next time I'll probably just put a little bit of cocoa powder in it or maybe some peanut butter.  I look up recipes online all the time,  and then I play around with ingredients on my own too. If I have a bunch of random leftover ingredients that might go well together,  I try it.    http://simplegreensmoothies.com/ I've gotten some good ideas for recipes here.     Edit: I've seen people on this sub use PB2 a lot, haven't tried it yet. But from what I understand it's lower calorie than peanut butter and could be used in smoothies as well.   Smoothies can get high in calories pretty quickly,  but I don't eat breakfast. I figure I can have one up to 400 calories without messing up my meals and snacks for the rest of the day. And if I know I won't be able to eat I'll make a more filling higher calorie one. If it's supposed to be a slower day,  I'll make a lower cal one so I can eat a lunch as well.   The sugar amount can also get high very fast. More greens and just a little fruit can help keep it down.  \",\n",

Mine tend to be between 200-300 calories depending on what fruits I switch up. They are typically spinach heavy with just enough fruit to sweeten it a bit.

I worked at an independent coffee shop for a while and started teaching myself how to do latte art. It isn't difficult, just takes time and practice. We weren't required to do it, but did it because it was fun, competitive with other baristas, and made the work day more interesting. Most customers don't expect it, but it's great to see the smile and surprise on their face when you hand their coffee to them. No extra charge.  It doesn't really take any extra time.

I could easily eat a whole platter. I have never asked my family to change their recipes or make special accomodations for me - it's never been an issue finding something to munch on. Well today as we are setting the table, I notice something different, my mom made vegetarian ham rollups. Instead of wrapping the pickle and cream cheese spread in ham, she wrapped them in a spinach leaf. They tasted so good, even some of my meat eating family were snacking on them, I actually had to make sure I got some because the regular ham rollups were being ignored.

Mushroom, tomato, onion, pepper, and cheese omelet is my favorite.   As a kid and even a teen, I hated beans, but since becoming vegetarian I have tried them again and opened up to them.   Ice cream is obviously delicious, but milk has always been my beverage of choice.   I looked for my main nutrition book to see if I could find any more information, but it's back at my parents' place. When I go home for thanksgiving I'll see if it has anything else to say about it and if it has anything about nutrition and depression.   Where are you looking to attend and what do you want to major in? Anything science tends to do that until enough information, research, and studies are available to come to a definite conclusion. In all of my classes I have been taught omega 3 is beneficial.   Me too, I just searched my schools courses to see if any went over nutrition and depression/anxiety, but I wasn't able to find anything.  I've started searching online for local psychiatrists/therapists, and it is slightly overwhelming.    Respecting my likes and dislikes is something I need to work on. I don't mind going to the bar and being social, but I'm kind of past the drunken college party scene.   I know you said changing your diet helped, but are you also currently taking any medication or seeking counseling?

It got worse once my mother died and when my closest friends and I went our separate ways once we graduated high school. There are a lot of other factors that's causing my depression( being attracted to women, wishing I was born a man, wishing I wasn't black, never being intimate with someone) which has caused me to gain so much weight. Since I graduated from my trade school, last month, I tried to start working out, but stop because of a terrible pain in my lower back and left leg. That really messed with my head. I want to get better, but it's like my body doesn't want me to. My anxiety prevents me from going outside. I feel very ashamed to be seen outside. I live in Germany with my dad( we're American). I don't want to be seen by people because I always get stared at, it makes me feel worse about myself. I know Europeans(or anyone, really) don't like fat people, so I hate myself so much for what I am. I want to get better, get in shape, but I feel so hopeless. All my friends are married, having children, and here I am, the loneliest I've ever been in my life. I don't know if I can make it, any longer. \",\n",

She was ruthless the first two seasons, but not a psychopath like Frank. Which is why I think the writers has been showing more of her humanity, this season, despite how many mishaps she's been having. People make mistakes. I don't think she  has what it took to be an ambassador( which was clear, throughout the season) and she obviously knew that. All the pressure just got to her, you know? If any of you were in her situation, the same would happen to you.  Besides, I think it's incredibly bad writing to just have the main characters come out on top, all of the time. That gets boring. A great example of this is the character Superman. He's completely overpowered. Yes, he has kryptonite to slow him down, but he's a very boring character because he's practically unstoppable. So, I think it's great that Claire and Francis hasn't been succeeding, this entire season. Otherwise it would just get predictable.  \",\n",

I see in the title credits that David Fincher is an executive producer. Makes sense. His movies seem to have somewhat of the same aesthetic as this show. Meaning, his movie and the show seem to have the same color pallet. The mutes blues, yellows and oranges, which I love. This show is gorgeously lit. I'm not sure if Fincher has some of his film crew working on the show or not, but I feel like I'm watching a Fincher movie, with every episode.  I know it's too late in the game for this, seeing as the show has established a feel, but I would honestly love for Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross to score the show. Their work for Gone Girl is my favorite body of work.  House of Cards is good television.  \",\n",

OP even tells you he struggles for two hours each day to stand up- if he could just get over that don't you think he has tried it already?   As someone who was clinically depressed I thought I was lazy for a very long time, but it didn't make sense to me because I tried so hard  and wanted to do so badly the things that I used to do with ease.

After a while of this stuff piling up you deserve to acknowledge that you are mentally ill, give yourself a break and not be labelled lazy. I'm not sure the 'psychologist' really knows what they are talking about, no serious psychologist/psychiatrist I have seen has ever gone down that route with me.  Take some time for getting better. Keep working out. Try meditation for focus (its easy to learn a few techniques online and it helps to train you to take control over your own mind). Get into a daily routine as best you can. Most people go through 4, 5, 6 different medications to find one that works for them because everyone's brains develop differently so keep going with that. Most of all, stay positive. It will pass eventually, try not to focus on your depression too much, keep treating it and eventually this will pass no matter what shit you have to go through between now and then. Maybe you'll have to take a regular job for a short while, who cares? You will always have time to start another business in the future. \",\n",

       "  'text': \" Britain's losing ground in recent years is largely a result of its economic structure, the fact it relies heavily on financial services- an area that was obviously shaken hard by the recession. Now that we are exiting the downturn the UK is definitely not losing ground anymore, in fact it is growing faster than any other western economy, has had GDP forecasts increased and will shortly overtake France, perhaps I overestimate the rate of growth but there is little dispute that the UK will be ahead of France in the next few years. (See recent IMF reports, laid out with some quite nice graphics [here](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10752204/UK-will-be-fastest-growing-economy-in-the-G7-this-year.html)!)  Obviously it is more difficult to forecast economic conditions further ahead but various sources suggest the UK will lead Europe's economies. [The Centre of Economics and Business Research](http://www.cebr.com/reports/cebr-world-economic-league-table/) comes to mind among others. On the assumption that the Euro holds, Germany drops from the 4th largest economy in 2013 to the 6th largest in 2023 and 2028. For France the drop is more precipitous  from 5th in 2013 to 8th in 2018 to 10th in 2023 to 13th in 2028. Similarly Italy drops from 8th in 2013 to 15th in 2028 and Spain from 13th in 2013 to 18th in 2028.   Interestingly, if the euro broke up Germany would fare rather better in the analysis. \",\n",

The fact that the euro has one interest rate that's too high for some places and too low for others has hugely prolonged economic decline and mass unemployment at one end of the spectrum and encouraged bubbles in the Spanish and Irish property markets at the other end.   Even putting the economy aside, in the midst of their crisis Brussels made a joke out of democracy in Italy, pressuring the EU commissioner Mario Monti in as Prime Minister and *cheering* as he appointed a new government that contained not a single elected politician.  A Civitas report last week showed that the United Kingdom (I don't personally know what the deal is for other economies) has not seen *any* more trade advantages as an EU member than it would have as a non-member.  The EU has its benefits, but what you say about it being good for every country involved is just not true. Plus, the UK economy will overtake France's this year and is on a trend to be the leader of Europe by 2030, with the pound. \",\n",

       "  'text': \" Every young guy gets overly hung up on the idea of getting laid and kissing girls. I won't deny that it is fun, but it is nowhere near as important as society/the media makes it out to be. The annoying thing is you won't truly accept that, regardless of how many times you are told, until you get laid, look back and see for yourself. Vacations are also fun experiences, but there is no need to feel suicidal if you haven't got to travel yet, it will just come later. There is so much more to life.  What's more, it isn't as if *everyone* around you is getting laid like you think. That's just another misconception- sex is sensationalized to such a degree very few people your age will openly tell you they are virgins even if they are. I can think of a few guys I know in their mid 20s who have never had sex and there is nothing wrong with them, they are decent looking, have normal social lives, college degrees and good jobs, it just didn't happen yet with them. (Thinking back I had short, sexual relationships with two women before my current long term girlfriend and if I would have chosen to stay at home the night I met these girls, or approached other, less interested, people instead there is every chance I would be in the same situation as you). Don't be too hard on yourself.   Having said all this, there are plenty of ways you can increase your chances of finding yourself a girl. Get out there more and increase your social circle by going to local events, classes or bars with your friends. Go to the gym and pay attention to the clothes, shoes, hairstyle etc. that you present yourself with. Have hobbies and interests outside of just hanging out with friends/girls so that you have other things to focus on while you're single and something to talk about with your girl when you eventually meet her. Hell, there are even apps now that let you speak to girls in your local area who rate you as attractive! Use them for practice if anything.  The best advice I can give you is to chill out. Don't be obsessed with girls, don't be obsessed with yourself (as this shooter was, though obviously that was a problem with his own mental health) and find a few cool hobbies that will give you something else to do and make you look interesting to the girls you meet in the future.  \",\n",

European cities often contain buildings that are *thousands* of years old so we can truly appreciate how short our lives are in the grand scheme of things. My mum knew people who were around at the same time as Abraham Lincoln.. its really not that long ago at all.

I have a little experience with what you've been through. I messed up and my best friend, the girl I thought I'd be with forever, broke up with me aged 18. It was hell on earth at the time because she cut me entirely out of her life and for a very long time I thought about her every single day. Looking back, the fact that we had no contact after the break up is one of the best things that could have happened for me. It may be tough to hear but it sounds like she really doesn't want to be with you, and that is her choice. You are young. There are literally billions of other girls in the world and if you keep pushing through things will change. You will start to move on. It may take years, but you will find someone else and you will be happy again. And when it happens you can look back and thank yourself for holding on in the darkest times to allow a better future to arrive.  She'll always have a place in your heart. The first girl you fell in love with will always be a special thing in your life, you'll never really forget her but you will slowly move on and the strong feelings will pass. Trust me when I say there is someone else out there who you *will* love in the future, they *will* love you back and, if you want to, you *will* spend your lives together- and it will be far more special than this first girl.   Cut her out of your life. Allow yourself to slowly move on no matter how long it takes and how much you want to give in. You will have a bigger chance at love. It happened for me and everyone I know, it will happen for you. You just need to eventually find the strength to go out there and get it. \",\n",

       "  'text': \" When you say you woke up and had to recall who the people in your house were, was it as extreme as having no memory of them at all or did you just feel strange and out of place, like it only just 'clicked' that each of them were members of your family? If you had memory loss and that still happens these days then you *need* to get it checked out. If its the latter though, I still occasionally feel like I'm half in my body and half out of it and everything seems out of place. You shouldn't worry about that too much.  Life can be pretty tough, believe me I've been through some shit. When you have real overwhelming depression the very concept of changing yourself and making your life better seems like an impossible task- I'm at college too and in darker times I've had days when I could barely make it out of bed and to the fridge to feed myself, as pathetic as that sounds, but the first step to recovering from a slump is to forgive yourself for any bad choices you have made and any time you felt too weak to make a change. You didn't gain any interests as a little kid, you never had a relationship, you feel like you are not in control of your life? That's ok! The past is the past, there's not a person alive who doesn't regret not doing a few things differently.   As well as forgiving your past mistakes you need to be fully aware that there are some things you have control over. The very fact that somewhere deep down you would *like* to change is the biggest hurdle in many ways. Depending on your circumstances and how much motivation you can find you can alter your life more slowly or quickly, just try to do something rather than nothing. The 'no zero days' post on reddit really helped me (look it up!) I found that the biggest flaw with most motivational techniques is that they can pump you up and make you want to change the world but that feeling burns out pretty damn fast. The key is baby steps, make a little change each week and stick to it. This time next year you will have completely reshaped yourself.  So what can you do? Your mood is crap, you don't like the fact you are skinny and you'd like to find yourself a girl? Working out is a pretty decent remedy for all of these things. I'm not saying you should run out of the door now and sign up at your nearest gym. Just commit to doing some exercise. Whatever you are comfortable with- 10 push ups and crunches each morning before you shower, go out for a real short run after you get up. And slowly increase this. Think about your diet too, what you put into your body makes all the difference when it comes to your mood and appearance (again, baby steps, but stick with it). Take a full body picture before you start, take it today even, and then you can always look back on it and see how far you came.  You work six days each week, that leaves the occasional day off. Do *something* with it. Its important that you rest when you can but if you want more of a social life then go for it- call up old friends, join a club, ask people if they'd like to hang out that day. Find something to live for and look forward to that day. Similarly try to structure your daily routine so you have an hour or two each night to chill out, no excuses, you work extremely hard and you deserve that.  Thirdly, take some time to find direction. It doesn't matter what it is. A job you would like to do, a business you would like to start, a home you would like to have. Anything that you could aim for that would make your life a happier one. If you don't want to be a software engineer- fine. There are literally millions of people with degrees unrelated to the field they end up excelling in. The fact that you have a degree in a respected subject will help you, and the skills you learn may well become useful later down the road. Very few people know what they truly want to do in college, don't worry about that.  For anything you absolutely can't change, just keep in mind that everything will eventually pass. You have to struggle through college with no free time? In a couple of years college will be over. All you have to do is wait, your circumstances will change and you'll have a lot of free time to fill with any wild post-college plans you make now!  You have it rough, its understandable that you feel like you have a terrible life but I believe in you. I know you are going to get better, we don't know each other but I am counting on you to do something here. Plus, you may not realize it but you have a few really great weapons in your arsenal. You are nineteen for a start, you have barely begun. You could count the number of years in which you have actually had some major decision-making-control over your life on one hand. There is so much time for you to alter your course, just start now and you can absolutely do pretty much anything you set your mind to. You still have both of your parents- I'm 21 and have no real family around me, I know that you can use them somehow, even just for a shoulder to lean on now and then. You're in college, that puts you ahead of most people educationally. You have work experience that is going to look really good on your resume. It may seem like its all just a drag but take whatever you can from every shitty experience you have.  If there's one thing I've learnt from my years with depression its that no one's life is as good as it looks to the outside world, never compare yourself to others because its very rare that anyone is willing to reveal their dark side. Hey, if you looked me up on facebook you'd probably think I have a pretty awesome life. I'm at an ivy league university, have a few pictures of me hanging out drinking with friends and spent the last summer break travelling around the world with my girlfriend. Months later my depression was triggered badly and I couldn't leave my apartment, was self harming and came close to suicide. During that time I found out that a good buddy of mine was also self harming and extremely stressed from the workload. I recently took a psychology class where we did an anonymous test for depression and eating disorders. In our ivy league class of supposedly successful students over three quarters gave results that indicated moderate to severe depression and around fifteen per cent were classed as having an eating disorder. Don't sweat. I know that you are going to come out of this a great person. If you need anything at all feel free to PM me, I'm not on reddit as often as I'd like but I'll always get back to you. \",\n",

After speaking with some of the doctors here they are confident that I have BPD. I never even knew what it was. After reading up on the symptoms, every single thing is applicable to me. Intense mood swings, splitting, issues in my friendships and relationships, impulsive behaviour, self destructiveness and suicidal thoughts etc etc.  I've been reading up on BPD and I feel so so much worse. I always knew there was something really wrong with me, and I thought it was Bipolar - I WISH it was bipolar because at least it is treatable. It feels like a death sentence. I cannot see myself ever finding love or holding down a meaningful friendship (my life is a long, smoking trail of destroyed and failed attempts to connect with people). I feel lost and upset and confused. I don't want this. Where do I go from here. FUCK \",\n",

       "  'text': \" The issue is that she is practically living here and not paying rent. I do like her as a person, I consider her a friend, which is why the situation is so difficult/complicated because I want to resolve this without damaging the friendship. I probably should have mentioned this before but she was actually living here before I moved in. She was living here with Roommate B until they split up, and I took over her lease. They got back together after a few weeks which is when this all started. Putting her on the lease is not an option because of a few things:   - the apartment is simply not big enough for four people (its a two bedroom apartment, and the room that I'm in isn't really a room)  - there is only three car spaces, with no other place to park within 3km (she currently parks in the visitor spot when she comes over, which residents aren't allowed to do)  - the landlord would not allow her back on the lease anyway, because she handled leaving so poorly last time (she basically just up and left and stopped paying rent - it was just luck that I happened to be moving around the same time because I was looking at other places before Roommate A asked me to take over the lease)  Having said all that though, myself and roommate A have discussed asking her to pay a share of the utilities bill when it comes next, based on her being here literally every weekend and having showers etc.  \",\n",

       "  'text': \" **TL;DR: My roommate has no respect for myself or the apartment, does not make any effort to keep the place clean or contribute to the household in any way. His girlfriend (who does not live with us) is at the apartment basically 24/7 and does not respect the boundaries of myself or my other roommate. There is constant drama in the household, and despite my best efforts to tame the situation, nothing is changing   it is affecting my work performance and getting me down. I don't know where to go from here.**  I moved in with roommate A   roommate B in February earlier this year. Roommate A is great - I have been friends with him for over 10 years, and we rarely have issues between us when it comes to household stuff. Roommate B (who I had only briefly met once before I moved in) on the other hand is an absolute fucking nightmare.  So there are a lot of issues at play here; Roommate B  - Never cleans up/washes his dirty dishes  - Never contributes to shared items for the household (toilet paper, cleaning products, milk etc.)  - Refuses to do stuff like take out the rubbish  - Has a total disregard for the noise he makes when other people are sleeping (Roommate A   myself both do shift work and generally work weekends while Roommate B has a day job and weekends off, so he's always having people over for drinks   coming home late over the weekend and just being as loud as fucking possible)  These are some of the more minor grievances, which are sort of a non-issue because of one thing - his girlfriend. His girlfriend will come over and do his washing, cleaning, cooking, and buy his share of the household shared items (they have a joint bank account). But that is also sort of the problem here.  Roommate B's girlfriend is over every single day of the week - from the afternoon when Roommate B finishes work (~4pm) until late into the evening (10-11pm). As I said above, she'll come over   cook for him, clean up all his mess, do his washing and pack his lunch for work the next day. The only reason she goes home is because myself and Roommate A sat down with them and told them that she could no longer sleep in the apartment during the week (after she had slept there for 15 consecutive days). So now it just feels like they're taking the piss. She is here as often as possible during the week without actually sleeping over, so technically following the agreement we had made with them, and then she is here from Friday afternoon until late Sunday evening (and will stay on a Monday if there is a public holiday because 'its apart of the weekend').   This has been a constant issue in the household, and myself and Roommate A are constantly having to address it. The issue isn't really so much even the time she spends here, its the way she treats the apartment   the fact that she comes here not as a guest, but to basically live in the apartment (without paying rent or utilities). Further issues with Roommate B's girlfriend;  - She does her washing here (not all of it, but regularly enough to be noticed)  - She has her own bath towel   hook in the bathroom  - She frequently refers to the apartment as 'home' or 'our place'  - She will invite her friends to the apartment without letting any of us know (has brought them over for dinner)  And just yesterday she walked through our front door unannounced, with a friend, while Roommate B was not home (he had given her his key to get in).  So all this stuff is going on on a regular basis, just constantly building up my frustration at the situation and both Roommate B   his girlfriend's total lack of respect for myself and Roommate A, and then on TOP of this, every single weekend (or close enough to not make a difference) they will go out for a drink, come home and have these loud, melodramatic arguments that go on for MINIMUM two hours. This is not just bickering, its huge episodes where she's screaming and crying and threatening to leave him forever. If he hasn't cheated on her, he's spent too much of her money or he's taken drugs again. This is of course followed by them making up and having ridiculously loud sex. I haven't been living here all that long but I have already lost count of the amount of times I have had to go into work with NO sleep because of this shit.   This honestly sounds like an episode of some stupid TV show and I legitimately feel like I'm trapped in the big brother house. I have voiced my concerns numerous times to the both of them on all of the above issues, and they say all the right stuff and it gets better for about a week, and then quickly descends right back into where it was.  I just want to be able to feel comfortable and safe in my own apartment. I want to be able to sleep   have my roommate respect my space and the apartment. I am on the lease until January and I am at a complete loss of what to do here. \",\n",
